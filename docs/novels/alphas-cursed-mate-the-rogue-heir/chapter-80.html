                <p>Dean pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched Lorenzo&#39;s shocked face as I professed my desire to bring Lia back. I knew it was risky but what was more risky was allowing Finn to get away with what he did. Up until now, I had always thought it was better for Lia to go. She brought a side of Luca that no one brought a raw side that can be activated by her tears or complaints. Yes, he was a rogue, but I would rather not have issues with him. Even with him being a rogue he had perfectly managed to send my mother to the land of no return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at my laptop screen as I waited for Lorenzo to bring in Luca&#39;s phone. Did I know how he would get it? No. But will he get it? Yes, because he was a cunning twat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected Lorenzo knocked on my door an hour later when I was already engrossed in my work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in&#34; I  and he walked in with a frown on his face. He glared at me; sometimes, I forgot he was my best friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you get what I asked for?&#34; I asked my attention still on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y,e,s but-&#34; he begged,  but I held my hands in his hand, signaling him to stop. I have had enough of his convincing today. If he could not see what was going on then it was not my fault. I would not lose my respect and fear before the eyes of the people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stretched forth my hand, willing him to bring the phone. He placed the phone in my hand as satisfaction watched over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took out the phone and started typing, &#34;I know you are meant to be with your mate, and it is honestly rude of me to text you at this time, but I just wanted you to know that I missed you a lot. I can&#39;t imagine that I am playing Lana Del Rey while on the bed alone. Do you remember what would have happened if we were together? I guess you would. We had an unfinished conversation before we left. I was wondering if we could meet and talk,&#34; I wrote and clicked send.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tapped her WhatsApp to see her beautiful photo. She was standing in the museum caressing a photo. Seems she had things for painting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are making a big mistake,&#34; Lorenzo said, and I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. Seriously, I thought he had gotten the message. I will not back down until I have Lia by my side. Maybe I would give Lia a chance since Luca should be with his mate, although I doubt he still loved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If so, I need to call Jenny and make sure she turns Luca&#39;s attention to her side. I would not want to continue the banter with Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have already made a mistake by allowing Finn to take Lia,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! The mistake you are making is trying to win back the lia&#39;s heart. You and I know that she doesn&#39;t love you&#34; he reminded me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love does not matter. The people want their luna back. this is where she belongs not Bloodhound Pack&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tossed the phone to his side for him to return it to Luca. Instead, the twat took the phone and read the mistake, and started whining as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are blackmailing her. You know that, right? How do you think Luca would react if he found out you used his phone to lure her out of her place? He is trying to forget her, for Christ&#39;s sake. I don&#39;t get the reason why you always choose Sabrina&#39;s word over mine!&#34; He shouted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped my lips as I raised my head to look at his face, masked with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sabrina is a witch and more powerful than us. You said that and you expect me to leave her opinion for yours? Seriously? And besides, if I messaged her, you and I know that she would not come, so put the phone back where you saw it before we alert Luca,&#34;  I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to say something but closed he pressed his lips together when he saw my glare.  A moment passed before he answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what are you going to do about the chemistry between Luca and Lia when she comes back? You and I both know that Luca loved her even though you refuse to accept it. He has been finding it hard to live without her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed and titled my head to the other side &#34;I seriously don&#39;t think that boy likes anyone. Or should I remind you that he was once obsessed with Jenny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes to a split as he looked at me. &#34;So you think he would later fall in love with Jenny? No. What I think is that we can ask Jenny to manipulate Luca. His weak point had always been his weak point. By doing so. He would be content with Jenny, and when Lia comes back, I would convince her to do her duty, which is to produce children, &#34; I explained with a proud smile. Such a brilliant idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel this is a bad plan. This might turn against you&#34; he persuaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes as I suppressed the hiss that tried to escape my lips. I rubbed my hands on my forehead for a while before I asked &#34;No one will know. So return his phone back&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked towards the door but the door opened by itself. My breath got caught in my throat at the person standing before us. It was Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at me and then at Lorenzo and gradually walked towards Lorenzo. Lorenzo&#39;s eyes widened as he moved backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca..luca what are you trying to do?&#34; He asked fear dripping from his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca remained silent and kept walking toward him until he hit the wall. Luca took his phone from Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! I muttered as he opened the phone. He scrolled through the phone and my heart was beating faster than normal.  I fisted my trembling hands. He is not meant to have such an effect on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately he saw the message, his jaw tightened as he glared at me. He dropped the phone on my front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is either you tell me who sent this, or I turn my back against the both of you, and trust me, it would not be fun,&#34; he growled.</p>
