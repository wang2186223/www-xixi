                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the main palace where we gather together and host parties. We would be having a party tomorrow where I would introduce you to everyone as their Luna,&#34; he said,,&#34; his arms wrapped around my waist as we stood inside the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I restrained the urge to remove his arms from my body. How can he be so comfortable? I mean, we just met, and he is already all warm and cozy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They have all been waiting for you. You don&#39;t know how thankful I am that I met you and that you agreed to follow me even when you had a thing with your husband&#39;s brother,&#34; he said in a nonjudgmental tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my tongue from telling him that he was the love of my life and probably the only man I would ever give my heart to. Luca had shown me how great love can be. Just the thought of him comforted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of telling him those words, I asked, &#34;You talk as if I am some savior you have been waiting for. Surely you would have been sleeping with someone else&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nahh. I am not really the flirting type and it scared the shit out of me when I could not find a mate especially since my sister and everyone around me have found one and you know the power of an Alpha is his mate,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded even though I did not understand how the power of an Alpha lay in his mate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not bother asking. Although I felt thankful that he had been waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I wondered what it would be like if I fell in love with him. Would he treat me like Luca did? Would he put me first before everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not have a wolf when I met Dean. Or I had a wolf, but it wasn&#39;t a strong one. Dean was disappointed. Very disappointed. He rejected me immediately, but his father insisted we get married,&#34; I said and turned to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you have rejected me if you found out that I did not have a wolf?&#34; I asked. I needed to know. Because Luca loved me even when I did not have my wolf. He was the one who persuaded Sabrina to do the ritual that made me regain my wolf. I wondered what life would have been like without him. I would have still been in the restaurant serving wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned towards me, and his eyes scanned my face. &#34;I would have loved you for who you are,&#34; he said as he caressed my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; he said as he took me round the palace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stopped at the third building. &#34;, This is the staff quarters, and this is also where the main cooking takes place.&#34; He explained as we entered inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the maids bowed down as we walked past them. The place suddenly became quiet. It felt strange to be accorded such respect. I mean, in Dean&#39;s palace; they bowed before me but gossiped at my back. They never kept quiet because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall model-like lady walked towards me and bowed at the both of us. She took my hands and said &#34;My Luna&#34; before kissing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to Finn., they maintained eye contact with each other for a while &#34;I will be back&#34; he said and left me in the middle of everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock filled me. Who could be that girl that he willingly left me for? He could have said he was busy or had the courtesy to return me back to my room? I didn&#39;t even know the way around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the clock. It was seven o&#39;clock. Pain bottled my chest at the thought of what I and Luca would have been doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We would have been in his room or mine eating our meal and after that I would play Lana Del Rey&#39;s music just to annoy him and we would talk till it was eleven before we had sex or maybe he would have started the foreplay after food. He seemed to have joy teasing me, making me beg for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes as my nipples tightened at the thought of his tongue on my nipples. Sometimes he bit to share and other times he just teased them, making me ask for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wondered if he would share the same routine with Jenny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Luna, I would like you to go back to your room. Seems the Alpha had more pressing matters to attend to,&#34; Annabel nodded, said,,&#34; drawing me out of my lustful thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her and nodded, her words ringing in my ear. It seems the Alpha had more pressing issues to attend to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could be so pressing that he left me for? As I walked back, the chilly breeze caressed my skin. It made me realize how lonely I was here. Luca would never leave me. He would either forgo what he had for me or explain the reason he had to leave me. Then he would peck me on my forehead before leaving. Here I was with no attention from anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked back to my room in silence. Immediately after I got to the door, I turned to &#34;Annabel. &#34;Tell Daina I need to see her,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded before saying, &#34;I could help you with whatever errand you want to send her. I am also at your service, &#34;she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I just need her to do something for me. I will call you if I need your service,&#34; I said and closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, Daina came inside with a smile. &#34;You called me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Have you ever been to this pack before?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded &#34;Yes. Once&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. We would go for a stroll this night,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A stroll?&#34; She asked,&#34; clearly surprised. I have thought and asked for her company, but I was surprised, I did not need it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Daina, a stroll. You are the only one that can keep me company. He left me and I have no one to talk to,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes softened, and she nodded with a smile and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately after she left, my phone beeped. My heart skipped at the name that popped on my screen. It was Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clicked on the message. Tears filled my eyes as it read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you are meant to be with your mate and it is honestly rude of me to text you at this time, but I just wanted you to know that I missed you a lot. I can&#39;t imagine that I am playing Lana Del Rey while on the bed alone. Do you remember what would have happened if we were together? I guess you would. We had an unfinished conversation before we left. I was wondering if we could meet and talk,&#34; it read.</p>
