                <p>&#34;Where are you taking me to?&#34; I asked as I tried to struggle from their grip. Their fingers dig into my skin the more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch as they take me to the rooftop and make me kneel. One of the maids steps forward toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me, my Luna,&#34; she says as she begins to Zip my gown down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; I ask as fear creeps into me. Why am I on the rooftop, a possible place for conviction, why are they undressing me? Are they about to behead me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But people who they have beheaded in the past wore their clothes. If I knew a way to stop them and remove the dagger from his heart, at least he would not wish for my death like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca could have protected me. I wish I had told him about my mate, he would have advised me. Told me to be careful and secure me. Then I would not be in this room with people who want to see me fall apart</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Alpha has asked that we strip you naked and give you punishment meant for treason&#34; she informed me as she pulled off my clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Treason! The punishment for treason is death. If they were not going to kill me they were going to give me punishment meant for death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kneel in front of them and two other guards completely naked. Tears rolled down my eyes. I have never been this humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To think that he allowed a common guard to look at Luna&#39;s body. It means he does not have any regard for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make my pain worse the sun is at its highest temperature increasing the pepper pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brings in the same bowl with pepper, wraps something in her hand, and begins to pour the pepper all over me from my neck downwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By this time I have no strength within me so I let them carry on with their work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds turn into minutes and minutes into hours. The pepper had already dried on my skin and I think I have become numb to the pain. Is a surprise that I am still alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly the guard poured cold water. I mean ice chilling water on me. I groan in pain. My wolf has been silent throughout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes as I welcome myself to the familiar world called darkness. As I close my eyes I pray I die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And intact I think I died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes to a comforting darkness, scenes of what happened from Merlin&#39;s birth to my last moment played before me. I feel every pain,  every tear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please stop&#34; I beg whoever is playing it as the pain becomes deeper reaching my bane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It stops for a while and a woman who has skin like milk appears before me. She is wearing a silk white gown that shines so bright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her necklace is made up of stars, and her white hair is so long that it flows down the ground. She has deep blue eyes and the moon is placed just above her crown. She smiles at me and bends to my height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My child&#34; she calls out as she stretches her hands to me, I flinch and move backward. She smiles even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not your child. A mother would not allow her child to suffer in the hands of other people.&#34; I retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not allow you to suffer,&#34; she said with a smile. A gesture that is becoming annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what do you call what you did? Making me get pregnant for Dean then making him reject me and mate me to someone who does not care about me or make me have feelings for his cousin?  What do you call that!?&#39;&#39;I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Destiny&#34; she answers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lower my eyebrow &#34;What?&#34; I ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Destiny,  my child&#39;s destiny. It was your destiny to meet Dean,  Finn, and Luca. And don&#39;t be deceived Luca cares about you&#34; She answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckle &#34;You can&#39;t be serious&#34;. Her face remained the same way &#34;Wait,  you are serious. You want me to die in Dean&#39;s hands. Anyway I am dead as you planned what do you do next&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will send you back. To live, to correct things. You will bring the end of Dean&#39;s rule&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who will take over&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoever you decide&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to go back. please&#34; I beg. The torture I suffered in Dean&#39;s hands is enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to go, my child. If you don&#39;t, many people will die,  Merlin will be killed and his blood will be on your hands&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She points her hands toward the front and a picture of Merlin running towards the forest and someone pursuing him. He keeps on shouting my name, the person finally catches up with him and is about to slit his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I shouted as I shut my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stretches her hands toward me &#34;Go and save your kind and your child&#34; she orders. My eyes close again as I welcome myself to another long silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes to find myself in a White painted room.  The smell of antiseptic hit my nose. I look around to see myself in a hospital. With the machine on. I have an oxygen mask around my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, she&#39;s awake. She&#39;s alive&#34; a middle-aged woman who I guess is a nurse shouts as she runs to meet the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor rushed in a few minutes later with his stethoscope hanging around his neck. He checks my heartbeat with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome back Luna,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod with a smile. He removed the mask from my nose and I heaved a sigh. Finally, I can breathe in fresh air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am going to ask you a few questions before I let you go.&#34; he says and brings out his five fingers before me &#34;How many is that?&#34; He asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five&#34; I answer. He keeps on asking me the same questions as he reduces his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay good. You will take some rest. Tomorrow we will discharge you and take you back home&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head relieved that I am going to be away from Dean for a day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door bursts open with a bang as Dean walks inside with the doctor.</p>
