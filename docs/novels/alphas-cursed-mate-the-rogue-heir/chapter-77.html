                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dread crept into my skin at Finn&#39;s words. He fixed his gaze on me with a permanent creepy smile. What was he talking about? What did he know about me that others did not know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard as I tried to pacify whatever was willing up within. I cleaned my hand on my skirt even though I knew my face was filled with guilt already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; I asked in a sudden, calm voice that contrasted how I was feeling inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged and strolled towards me, his arms wrapped against his chest. &#34;Well, I did a brief check&#34; up on you. I got to know about who raised you. What is her name again?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear blocked my throat as I tried to speak &#34;Benedicta&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded.&#34;Thanks for the correction. Don&#39;t mind me, I forgot about her nod. But with time, I would meet her. You know, I don&#39;t have a mother of my own, so my wife&#39;s mother would automatically be mine. Who is that boy that lives with her?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, sweat was already tricking down my spine. Heat cloaked my skin even though the air can was on. Maybe it was because he was really close and also because of the question he just asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Merlin. Someone knew about Merlin&#39;s existence. It was really dangerous. Imagine he got to know about him. Would he kill me and my son? Would he seize him and take him as a hostage to mock Dean? Gosh! Dean might even deny Merlin. What would I do? Images of Merlin shouting my name to free him while he was locked behind bars filled my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia!&#34; I could hear Merlin or Dean shouting at me. &#34;Lia!&#34; The voice came again, this time closer than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The snap of fingers at my front brought me back from my thoughts. &#34;I asked you a question,&#34; Finn said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flinched and turned to him. &#34;What?&#34; I asked in a scared voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked who it was. the boy, Benedicta is always with&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He.. He.. he is her sister&#39;s son. The sister died while giving birth,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sympathy watched his face as his eyes softened. He placed his hands on my shoulders. I am so sorry. Was that the reason why you seemed uncomfortable when I asked the story? Look lia. I would never bring it up again. Just wanted to know more about you&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded with understanding. Of course. He did not know the implication of what he just asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew me in for a hug, wrapping his arms around my waist. I sniffed his scent and reasoned the scent that filled my nose was identical to Luca&#39;s scent. I closed my eyes to the comfort of the scent as it calmed my fear. Gradually, I wrapped my arms around his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stroked my back trying to soothe me, but all I could think of was Luca. He used to comfort me this way, especially when I got scared of Merlin&#39;s safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww, you are already hugging each other,&#34; a high-pitched feminine voice said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly drew myself out of the hug even though I felt reluctance rumble over his body. I turned to meet a girl standing at our front with a wide, white smile. A man stood close to her, his arms on her waist. Maybe he was her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wearing a long blue bodycon dress, enhancing her shape. She packed her hair high ponytail with a dropping blue earring. Her bag was also blue, and she had shades of blue blush on her face. She seemed to have a&#34; blue color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn cleared his throat as he introduced her&#34; Lia, meet Ava, my younger sister&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She threw her hands into the air.&#34; I am his twin sister. He is not older than me. I just let him go before me to see the world, then came out two minutes later.&#34; She said with a playful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blab for all you want, Ava. I am your older brother,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the both of them, brother, trying to see the difference between them. They actually looked alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am lia. His mate,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded with a knowing smile. Of course, she knew that I was his mate. I don&#39;t think her twin brother would keep such a secret from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man beside him walked towards me and stretched forth his hands. &#34;I am Killian, Ava&#39;s mate, and Finn&#39;s best friend&#34; he introduced while I took his handshake. They seem to be united.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please, you are my brother-in-law &#34;&#34; Friend,, you seized being my best friend the day you looked at my sister with lustful eyes, &#34;&#34; Finn replied with a smile even though anger laced his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kilan gave him a tight smile. &#34;Losen up man. It would do you some good,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s muscles tightened as he glared at him, while the killer &#34; returned his look with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me show you around,&#34; Ava said to brighten up the tense mood. I guess Finn had refused to forgive his best friend for fucking his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn drew me to himself as he tightened his arm around me. &#34;She just arrived.&#34;We&#39;re not done talking,&#34; he said in a deadpan serious tone. Then, to ease the tension, he said, &#34;Stop looking at me like that. You have your husband. Let me spend time with my mate,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava nodded. Mate, &#34;Yeah, spend all the day with her. I would still be closer to her than you,&#34; she said and hugged me. &#34;I am so happy. I finally have a sister,&#34; she said and walked away with Killian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they were gone, Finn turned to me. She can be clingy sometimes,&#34; he apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head with understanding. &#34;And what about Killian? You seem to have a tension between the both of you,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of that, his eyes darkened for a while as he looked at me. He broke my trust. Slept with my sister. I would have forgiven him for that, but he broke her heart again and when he discovered she had a mate, he killed the mate. He denied her that, the comfortable late bond,&#34; He said, his voice filled with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My sister might have forgiven him but I can&#39;t,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth to say something but,&#34; he dragged me &#34;Come,, but let me show you the other side of the palace&#34;</p>
