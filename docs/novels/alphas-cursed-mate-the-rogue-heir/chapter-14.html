                <p>The loud knock on my door interrupted my sleep. I looked at the time I was just five o&#39;clock in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could be so urgent that they had come to knock on my door?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It better be something reasonable. I rubbed off the sleep from my eyelid and went to open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met Alberto, the head of the palace guard panting several beads of sweat dropped off his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the matter?&#34; I asked as I closed my door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed his head &#34;Two of our men were killed&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I asked my voice low with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we under attack?&#34; I asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; They were the ones you appointed at the gate. Lia woke up a few minutes ago to go out and we refused as you instructed&#34; he said and paused for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goosebumps filled my skin. Could it be that Lia was the one who killed them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she looked too innocent for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She went back and came out with Luca. They told him what you said and he told them to leave the gate. When they refused he shot the both of them and went out with Lia&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned, where could they have gone this early morning? Could they be having an -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, Lia does not look like someone who would fall for Luca. Besides, Luca has never been the faithful type.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send our men to trace them and tell us as soon as they can. Or better still, track them if they can!&#34; I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed immediately and left. I went inside my room and closed the door with a bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo came in a few minutes later. His eyes widened as if he had heard what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to stop Luca. Or he might kill Lia, there is no other reason he could decide to help her. He is trying to be an angel&#34; he said as he sat on my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I paced around, I walked toward the window where I could have a clear view of the park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or, he might be having feelings for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Luca I knew would not kill someone for just any woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This made my body itch the more, I wanted to dig into his heart to know if he wanted to kill her or if he wanted to have her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got the information later on that they had gone to visit Sabrina. At least that was where his car stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately told my father and he had decided to wait till they returned to punish Luca if he could not give a good reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later he drove into the palace at full speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood riled up within me as I saw Lia and Luca step out of the car.  Like what in &#34;stay away from my mate&#34; did he not understand?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he pointed out that she was not yet my wife. I could not just wrap my head around the fact that she spent more time with him than with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I knew I had made myself unavailable she could have grown a bond with someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not  Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the scene last night, I had concluded that I would stop whatever bond they had before it became too risky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca was a sly, cunning snake. For all I might know he might be using Lia as a pawn in his game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worst still was that Lia was innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought he was going to listen to me and stay away from Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So imagine my fucking surprise he came out and even opened the door for Lia to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did the both of you visit a witch this morning?&#34; my father asked immediately as they entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled and his eyes darted to mine</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you had me followed,&#34; Luca asked with a crooked smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you take the future Luna to?&#34; My father asked with a stern voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca swallowed &#34;We went to see Sabrina. You allowed her to be in the park even though she is a witch. So you can&#39;t tell me we can&#39;t visit her,&#34; he said and glanced at Lia, his lips raised at one side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia nodded with relief. That only meant one thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca had tricked us. They did not visit Sabrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled at me as if he knew what I was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bloody bastard! I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you go with Luca?&#34; My father asked Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia tightened her grip around her bag &#34;Your son refused to allow me to go on my own&#34; she reported.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why were you going to Sabrina &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For protection&#34; She answered with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For protection?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, my maid was killed last night. A man attacked me and almost stabbed me. An outsider because he did not have our scent&#34; she replied. It was clear that they had planned this together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father turned to look at me with a lowered eyebrow of course I skipped the path of Lia being attacked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean, were we attacked?&#34; he asked me in a deep voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you did not deem to tell me?&#34; He asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept quiet. How was I meant to tell him that if I had to tell him? I would have told him that my mate openly hugged Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confided in Luca in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head and turned to them &#34;You all can go. And Luca we do not kill our own. Put it at the back of your mind&#34; he warned him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get ready for the mating ceremony this evening,&#34; he said and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca walked up to me and leaned into my ear &#34;Try harder next time&#34; he whispered and left me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him. Of course, there will be no next time because I would have marked her as my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked inside to prepare for the re-mating ceremony.</p>
