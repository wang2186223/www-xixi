                <p>Luca pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned in frustration immediately I saw Jenny&#39;s plastered smile. Seriously? What did this girl want? I thought I drove her out of my room a moment ago. Frustration washed within me, itching my skin. I needed time to concentrate, time to think about what Sabrina just said. To know which side I should be on. What I needed was a cool bath, playing Lia&#39;s white Mustang, a song I felt was too feminine till now. Now that she was gone, I would gladly attach myself to anything that would give me a close connection with Lia. Not this twat that was standing before me with a fake smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked with a bored expression. I did not even try to hide my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face fell as I spoke. &#34;you seem so in a hurry to dismiss me,&#34; she said in a disappointed tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, too tired to kid or feign concern. &#34;Yes. Jenny, I want to be left alone&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I am your mate and we need to work things out. You know that. Lia is gone and I am here. She is properly fucking Finn&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger itched within my skin. I closed my eyes to unheard what she just said. And block my mind from the image that flooded my vision. Images of Lia&#39;s pink full lip wrapped around his cock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew what she was trying to do. She was trying to get into my head, trying to make me hate Lia but that is something that was never going to work. I would never hate Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I faced her this time ready to watch her disappointed face &#34;Keep Lia out of your mouth and keep this at the back of your mind that not everyone is like you. Some people are loyal. Now get out,&#34; I said, banging the door against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put her feet in between the door, stopping it from closing. I raked my hands through my hair as irritation spiked within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have heard what you said, but we are not done. I am not leaving here until we talk like couples&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the thing, Jenny. We are not couples and we will never be now leave!&#34; I shouted as anger burst within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards by the side of the door flinched at the impact of my outburst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Luca. We are not done. We are not over! I came back for you and I will not stop till I get you,&#34; she shouted with desperation as tears filled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for a moment I was tempted to believe her that she came here for my sake, but I knew she did not. For the past seven years, she did not bother contacting me or anyone at all. She left everything behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh and stepped aside for her to come in, not because my heart had softened but because I knew Jenny. She never gave up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked in and sat on the bed. I stood in front of her, refusing to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes softened as she looked at me. &#34;Look Luca, I know you hate me, but people make mistakes. I made a mistake by having an affair with your cousin but believe me when I say he tricked me. You also cheated on me with Lia but I would forgive you and put everything behind if you will. I still love you, Luca,&#34; she said. She looked at me for a while, waiting for an outburst from me before she continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, when I escaped from Luca I wanted to die. To give up and leave this world, but each time I did that, I imagine the raw pain you would feel if I died and I lived. I knew we were going to reunite together, and that we were going to have Vermont,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged my lip at the hearing of Vermont. It was a place I had foolishly promised her that I would take her to after my marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever she just said was true. I felt pain when she left for a while. I thought of consuming suicide. Especially when I was sent out of the pack for treason, but Sabrina saved me. That is why I would always be grateful to her, even though she is a pain in the ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, what pissed me off in this heartfelt speech she just gave was the right she had to tell me that I cheated on her with Lia. It is ridiculous. You don&#39;t ever refer to love as cheating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her to examine her face, her brown eyes, and those lips I once lusted after. I obeyed every word that came out of my lips, but I would never do that again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia was not a fling Jenny. I fell in love with her. You know how I used to allow you to have a threesome with Bianca. I could not bring myself to have the thought of seeing anyone with Lia but me. I could not cope with the idea of someone having her body, be it male or female. Ask Dean I fought with him because he tried to have her. That is love, Jenny. I wanted a smile on her face over everything. We are different, Jenny,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw tightened with anger. &#34;Luca you can&#39;t deny that you never felt a thing for me but since you have decided to, I would leave you at that for now. Soon you will come crawling towards me. You have always enjoyed my pussy over others,&#34; she said, then smiled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Till then I propose I offer a truce. We become partners and I can help bring down Dean and Finn together. He wronged me and I want to get back at him, Finn also Wronged me and they deserve to die,&#34; she said with a creepy smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bile welled up within me. I can&#39;t believe that I was once in love with this girl. She came back to seek revenge on Finn and  Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned toward her only keeping a little space between us &#34;Now listen to me you obnoxious brat if you lay a hand on Dean I would have your head and if you kill Finn or try to do that and harm Lia I would use your name to make a perfect horror story. The Luca you know is gone now,&#34; I said and grabbed her by her hair as I dragged her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good riddance.</p>
