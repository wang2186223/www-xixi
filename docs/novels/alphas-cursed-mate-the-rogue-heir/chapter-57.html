                <p>I have had a variety of sex with different women. Most of them were good in bed, the others were just lazy and wanted me to do everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not mind. After all, there was love in sharing, and I did not mind sharing my dick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never believed in commitment that much until I met Jenny. I was faithful to her in a way. She had my type of desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sometimes organized threesomes together with a harlot from the brothel but with Lia it was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if she was made only for me. Yes, there were times in the past when I imagined what our first sex together would be like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this experience was more than my expectations. It was as if she was wholly made for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything about her. Her smile, her nipple, her pussy, her moans, and, everything fucking thing which she was made up of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We lay peacefully on the bed after the mind-blowing sex. A smile tugged my lips at the thought of making sure she knew who she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean was quite lucky that I had not had sex with her before he tried to touch her because I could guarantee you that if it was now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would have killed him outrightly. She belonged to me and no one else. The moon goddess would be damned if she thought I would let go of her because she mated her to someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking of her mate Finn, I have to find a way to convince him to leave Lia alone or, better still, kill him without leaving any trace behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door interrupted our peaceful moment. We stayed the same way, not bothering to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knock came again but we stayed. &#34;Are you not going to answer your visitor?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. No, if I did. They might bring news that will scatter our joy. Talking from experience our union never lasted before a storm came and I was getting used to that fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When they are tired of knocking they will go &#34;I assured her and buried my head in her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knock came again on the door and I squeezed her tighter not wanting to leave her warmth. A laughter escaped her lips  &#34; Luca just open the door and see who it is&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned in frustration. Being a prince was tiring. You would have to keep being disrupted whether a higher authority wanted to see you needed your presence for something or wanted to deliver a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was seriously frustrating and now I had to leave my comfort zone for it. I looked at the beautiful smile on her face and planted a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss lasted longer than expected; warmth had already started feeling in my body before it stopped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh as I wore my grey sweatpants. I was never going to get enough of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards the door and opened it expecting to see a guard or someone else. My frown deepened when I saw Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked not to try to hide my displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged on his lips and my irritation increased. Seriously, does he have to be this annoying? He stretched forth his hands with a piece of paper written.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him and then at the paper. &#34;What is this?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A letter from your lover&#39;s mate,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart stopped beating for a while. What could be in this letter? I looked at Dean to see a mocking smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slammed the door on his face. I opened the letter and began to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colour drenched my skin at the Letter. Anger mixed with dark possessives wrapped around my insides. Who the hell did he think he was to give us three days?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia sat up immediately and she saw my face. I guessed she knew something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything okay?&#34; She asked, covering her breast with a blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I threw the letter at her and lay beside her. She read the letter quickly and turned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is giving us a three-day ultimatum?&#34; She asked. I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain tightened around my throat. Why did the moon goddess have to be cruel? Why not plant the both of us together as mates? After all, it&#39;s been a while since I have lost my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was meant to have a second chance mate. Everybody did, so why did my case have to be different?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrenaline rushed within me. I could not bear the thought of losing her. Her being my cousin&#39;s wife was different. At least I got to see her and talk to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being away felt like hell. It was as if a hole was plugged into my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her soft palm on my chest as she caressed my shirt. Gradually my body returned to normalcy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have already made a promise to you. I will be with you and not with Finn. When that day comes with you by my side, I will deny him, and it will be over,&#34; she assured me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart warmed at her promises &#34;Are you sure?&#34; I asked my voice soft with vulnerability. Gosh! I hated being vulnerable, but Lia was worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded with a smile &#34;Yes, babe,,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my attention to her as my eyes widened. &#34;Did you just call me babe?&#34; I asked, unsure of what I had just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded with a smile. &#34;Yes,&#34; she said and rested her head on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  smiled, satisfied with her words. Things were getting better. She now showed that she also wanted me as much as I wanted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged my lips as I tickled her. She burst into laughter. Her sweet laughter filled the room, sounding like a rhythm to my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while the laughter died down and she looked at me &#34;I am never going to leave you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not just a statement. It was a promise.</p>
