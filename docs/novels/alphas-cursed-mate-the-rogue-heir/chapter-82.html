                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the message with mixed feelings. Part of me was excited about the text, but another part of me could not help but wonder if it was right to meet Luca. He missed me as much as I missed him. My aches from the absence of him. But what could I do? If Finn found out, he would get angry at me for even considering escaping to see my ex-lover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again, he had no right to be angry. He left me on my first night here and eloped with a girl whom I did not know. It was already past eight. I was not used to my companion coming home late. Right from time, Benedicta came home early, Lexie came home early, and Luca found an excuse to ensure I was always with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock interrupted my thought. Annabel came inside carrying a food tray with her. She placed it on the table before turning to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I figured out that you would be hungry so I brought your food. If you are not okay with it you can tell me. I would ask the cook to prepare another one&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pleasant smile crept on my lips. Even though I had dismissed her the first instant she was trying all she could do to please me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you bring?&#34; I asked her, trying to start a conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bread and avocado with egg and tea,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice&#34; I replied and walked towards the table. My tummy rumbled from the aroma that filled my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come and join me&#34; I invited her even though I knew she would decline. She was good at declining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head &#34;Thank you your grace but I can&#39;t&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;. Nothing is just that we are not allowed to eat with others and by the way I am not hungry,&#34; she said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged and continued eating my food. &#34;Have you seen his grace?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her eyebrow &#34;Do you mean the Alpha, your mate?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. She swallowed hard for a while, picking her fingers. As if she was not meant to tell me where he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is with his cousin,&#34; she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm,&#34; I nodded. &#34;His cousin? Does his cousin have a name?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swallowed hard.d &#34;Her name is Bianca, &#34; she supplied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca? &#34;How are they related?&#34; I asked her because the last time I checked, he said his only family was his sister and her mate or was it my brain that was trying to play with my feelings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged, &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; She said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not know? It means he could be lying about her identity. She could be his concubine or his true love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fresh needle of pain stabbed my chest at the thought of him having true love aside from me. I did not want to remain in a relationship where I was hated or seen as an ornament or a toy to occupy a position that needed to be filled. I have already had enough of being Dean&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped my fork on the table and stared at her &#34;Do you know where they are?&#34; I asked, impatience flooding my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes but the Alpha said he does not want to be disturbed&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Disturbed? I am his mate Annabel, not a stranger. Take me to their position&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t. I might be punished&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped my lips. Here I was, thinking she wanted my favor. I sprang up to my feet and stood inches away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like you, Annabel, and that is why I would pretend that I did not hear what you just said.it is either you take me there or you give me a location&#34; I ordered with a sharp tone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A minute passed before she said, &#34;They are in the pool&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good, that was all I needed to hear: &#34;Take your food away. I am not hungry&#34; I informed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do as I say&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and carried the food away wearing a scared face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out one of my Royal gowns to impose my royalty and stormed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did I know where the place was located? No, but I would find it. A pool cannot be that hard to find.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started asking all the maid questions. As I advanced in the direction of the pool, my heartbeat fastened. What if I caught them in an awkward position? What if he was kissing her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long walk, the pool came into sight. The girl sat at the edge of the swimming pool while Finn swam inside shirtless with only a boxer on.  His sister and her husband sat on the other side discussing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said something and he started laughing. A burst of genuine laughter echoed around the atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was what he was doing. This was the important thing that he left me for. He preferred to spend time with her than with his mate, whom he left halfway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia&#34; he called immediately he noticed my presence. His eyes widened with shock. She turned to look at me with a smile. I tried to detect if she was mocking me or giving me a genuine smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swam towards the edge, his whole body dripping with water, and his dark hair settled on his face, enhancing his look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took his towel from her and walked towards me. Worry shadowed his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step back, stopping him from coming closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia I..&#34; He began trying to give me a silly excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to know why you left early. I have seen the reason why, and I would love to go back to my room. my presence does not distract you,&#34; I said with a trembling, pained voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gosh! Lia, I ..&#34; he began, but I had already walked away. My heart was beating fast as tears gathered in my eyes.</p>
