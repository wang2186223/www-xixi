                <p>chapter of my life how the hell did this happen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would you have me do?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A genuine smoke shadowed her lips. &#34;Call the whole pack tomorrow and tell them that it is a lie. Make sure she looks manipulative to them, and then we would work on Dean recovering his memory about Merlin and Lia. He needs to know that he has a child. He is not going to have lia. You and I know who she wants. He just needs to crown him the heir apparent to the throne. By this, every other opposition dies down. Including the unknown hybrid&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Painful bottle around my chest. Her palm was a genius plan. A perfect plan but I would end up losing Lia. She would never be mine publicly, she would just be Dean&#39;s own. I would forever lurk around in her shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if on cue, Sabrina said. &#34;You could kill Dean and take his wife after he has made Merlin his heir. By doing so, you would have the throne, Lia, and Merlin who you have grown attached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Benedicta and she gave me a nod. She accepted Sabrina&#39;s suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Sabrina. &#34;Thank you so much,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded happily. It is the first time I have had her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked out of the house with only one regret, which was the fact that I could not see Merlin. I knew that Sabrina had advised me but I was going to that house with one agenda. Either I burn Jenny or she gets out of the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0097</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately Lorenzo stormed off in anger after learning the truth. I called in the bodyguard who I have sent to follow Luca to give me feedback on when he went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He entered inside after I had ordered him to come in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did he go?&#34; I asked without wasting time. I would pay the place a visit. I needed to see for myself what he was up to. He hardly spent time in the palace again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He stopped at the outskirts of the town but I do think he outsmarted us. He came back with a cab&#34; he reported.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! I shouted as I mumbled a lot of curses under my breath. He knew we were following him and had decided to do otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you be so ignorant? He was not meant to find out!&#34; I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only grace saving this man was that he was a good soldier to the pack. If not, he would have been dead by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. Your grace. Our men also saw him with Sabrina, the witch,&#34; he informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and waved my hands at him, dismissing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, he closed the door behind him, and I leaned back into my chair. Worry trickled down my spine. Sabrina hated us, that was a fact, and if he was on Luca&#39;s side, he would eventually win us. What were they discussing again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door interrupted my thought. I  groaned in frustration. They should allow me to be left alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny strolled inside with a paper in her hand and a smile that was looking so fake. I closed my eyes for a moment calling on patience to come to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I asked. &#34;What do you want&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled and looked around the office. &#34;You seem to have changed your office decoration. It&#39;s a shame, I preferred the last one&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth in anger. It was getting more difficult to control myself around annoying people</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you died. The world does not stop because some whore passed away&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of anger passed through her eyes. She narrowed her eyes to a split as a smile of satisfaction tugged my lips. I have successfully hurt her feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head and squared her shoulders before sitting down. She tossed the paper to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at her and then the paper &#34;What is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curled my hand into a fist &#34;Look if-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Open it and stop blabbing,&#34; she said in a nonchalant tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the fuck. In fact, at that moment I had made up my mind that she was going to leave this palace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at her once more before taking the paper. I took a good look at it trying to make sense of what was on it. It contained a list of gifts and cooking stuff that summed up to three million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she sought was a feast. She needed three million dollars. This was too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tossed the paper back at her. &#34;It&#39;s too much. If we are holding a feast, cut down the budget. Meet Lorenzo not me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not a feast!&#34; She said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my eyebrows. &#34;If it is not a feast then why would you need such an amount of money?&#34; I asked impatience trickling down my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s for me and Luca&#39;s marriage,&#34; she said and brought out a card from her purse and handed it over to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the card in disbelief. It had my seal and signature on it. I don&#39;t remember signing any of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How? I mean did Luca agree? And how did you get my seal and signature?&#34; I was shocked by what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised a shoulder. &#34;Well, I would convince Luca about the wedding, and as for the seal, I stole it, and the signature, I forged it,&#34; she confessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh! What have I gotten myself into? &#34;You just stayed for a day and you are already forging signatures?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, if I had come to you, you would have never agreed so I used another means,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger welled up within me. Irritation itched my skin. The fact that she stole the Royal seal, forged my signature, and even lied about Luca&#39;s consent made me want to kill her and rip her heart out. She was better dead than alive. I wonder what Luca saw in her that made him depressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I banged my hand on the table &#34;Have you gone mad? This wedding is not going to be held. I do not approve of it and I never will. Tomorrow morning get out of this palace&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed unaffected and even stared at me in the eye. &#34;Is it just me or all Attic royalties are the same? They talk to the women they once fucked anyhow without any remorse. Well, for your information, I am Luca&#39;s mate, and I am not going anywhere,&#34; she affirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Lorenzo, together with Luca, barged into the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Darling-&#34; she started but was cut off when Luca raised her with her hair. She winced in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who told you we were getting married?&#34; He asked in a lethal voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need to. We are getting married, and you waited for me for so many years,&#34; she said, and Luca tightened his grip on her hair, making her wince the more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought her face to his own bite kept two inches apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you listen to me you bloody twat. I am not your mate and would never be. I Luca Attic reject you as my mate forever&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not accept your rejection and I will not leave,&#34; she said boldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca scoffed and looked at her again. Within a split second, he brought out the white oak and drove it into her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will remain trapped forever,&#34; he said and turned to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care what plan you had, but if you let her go, just know that I would kill you irrespective of the family bond we share, &#34; he said and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0098</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; I asked to open the invitation card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An invitation to Luca&#39;s marriage&#34; he informed me. Although he tried to sound normal, I could feel the hint of joy in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock cloaked my body as goosebumps filled my skin. My heart squeezed with pain as I stared at the card in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I asked my voice almost in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An invitation card to your ex-lover&#39;s wedding&#34; he confirmed with a mocking smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I refused to pay attention to whatever he was saying. I knew he would be happy that Luca was getting married. It would make him have me all to himself. To anyone, it would be cute, seeing your mate wanting to spend time with you, but to me, it was pure torture. He was just a friend or any male friend. His smile did not give me butterflies, his gaze did not make me feel like the only person in the room, nor did his mate&#39;s scent make it uncomfortable for me to think about anything. He would never be Luca no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who gave you? I.. I mean how did you get this card? Who sent it to you? How sure are you that Luca agreed to this? There must be a mistake somewhere&#34; I said with a trembling voice. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. Luca would not just leave me. We fucking kissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of anger swept through Finn&#39;s face. His jaw tightened &#34;Why? What makes you think that Luca would not move on? Huh?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret swept through me. I would have never said such a word. He is my mate after all. He must be hurting inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did. I did not mean it that way?&#34; I said in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! You meant Luca would never leave me. He would wait for me. He cannot be with his mate. I thought you said you would give us a chance. I thought you said you would get rid of Luca! I am your mate Lia! Your mate! Not your fucking toy that you lie to and give fake promises away. You don&#39;t even know what you want? You see me with Bianca, and you get jealous and mad and even try to give me some silent treatment, so imagine how I would feel if you were crying because Luca is getting married! Your ex-lover is getting married and you are crying in front of your mate!&#34; He shouted, his voice echoing unbounded the full room. The air around the room became warmer with his outburst, his blue eyes darkened to a stormy sea on a cold night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh. He had every right to be angry and I must have been a fool to think Luca would love me. That he would make sacrifices for me. That he would stay away from a mate he mourned for years even while I was with him. A mate he loved so dearly that he decided to avenge her death by killing his aunt and his cousin, hell he wanted to kill me and Merlin because we were related to Dean. He wanted to kill a seven-year-old boy for a woman that died seven years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should focus on my marriage. Focus in Finn desperately craved my trust and attention, and with time, things would get better. After all, I hated Luca when we first met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to him. &#34;I was just surprised, not sad&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at me and took a step back, his fist still in his pocket. He strolled around the room twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surprised huh?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded with dread. His actions were becoming creepy. What was he planning to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked around again before he stopped in front of me. His breathing increased; he pointed a finger at me as if to warn me, then curled it into a fist and dropped it. His whole body trembled with anger. He opened his mouth to say something and closed it again. He was trying so hard to control his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Oh please, Lia, cut that crap. Who the hell do you want to deceive, huh? Is it me or someone else? Because you can&#39;t tell me? I don&#39;t know the difference between surprised people and those that are sad. Surprised people don&#39;t cry, their hands don&#39;t tremble because they received news that their boyfriend was getting married!&#34; He shouted his veins throbbing out of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not lying Finn. It came as a surprise. I would agree that a bit of me was sad but you have to understand. I am human, I have feelings. I was dating his boy just three days ago and now he is getting married to someone else. It feels so annoying and painful. I feel used&#34; I explained. He had to understand me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I still couldn&#39;t understand what was going on. We kissed some hours ago and now I am getting an invitation to his marriage. My mind flashed back to how he resisted kissing me back. How I was the one who imitated the kiss because I thought he was missing me but still wanted me to be saved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization crept into my brain slowly, piece by piece. All the moment he had rejected me in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could get anyone to sleep with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t mistake my kindness for love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then the way he denied any ill allegations when I asked him why he did not kiss me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am used to it. Perfectly used. All those moments were pretense. They did not mean anything to him. Maybe he wanted to get into me, make me trust him, and then hurt Merlin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear gripped me as I thought about Merlin, could he be the one lurking as the hybrid? Could he be the bloodthirsty hybrid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped my lips. The mistake he made was thinking I would not get back at him for what he did. First I would get Merlin out of the place and then kill him and Jenny</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Finn. &#34; I trust you and I want you,&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow and glanced at me unsure of what to believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped close to him only an inch apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you don&#39;t trust me but let me prove it to you. Let&#39;s get married&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0099</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I stepped out of Dean&#39;s office I went straight towards my room and locked my door tightly behind me. I could feel my eyes changing, my fur coming up. The hunger from before had returned. I closed my eyes as I tried to control my desires. I can&#39;t harm anyone and I was a good hybrid, not a bad one, not a bloodthirsty one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I should call Lia. She would be able to smother me. I called the first time but she did not pick up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear gripped me. Was she angry with me? Did she believe what the invitation card said to her? Was she going to leave me again or for the final time? Had Jenny succeeded in tricking both of us</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called her again but she did not pick up. The second time. Lia always picked up her calls immediately after you called her. She was always on her phone either playing her Lana del Rey song or watching an erotic movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What are the chances that she is snubbing me? I texted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please pick up my call. I have to explain everything to you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She read it, and for a moment, I saw her typing back. My heartbeat increased in anticipation. What was going to be her response? Anyway, I was going to explain to her and she would understand. We loved each other, we can&#39;t live without one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sent me a text message with three simple words that flipped my mood upside down.&#34; fuck you, Luca&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, no. It can&#39;t be. What sound do I say to make her believe me? I started texting back when a notification popped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This contact blocked you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! What the hell just happened? I reread it to be sure of what I was seeing. She blocked me. She Fucking blocked me without waiting for an explanation. Sometimes it felt as if she did not trust me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This felt as if she was ending what we shared. As if she was letting me know that I meant nothing to her. Absolutely nothing. Felt as if she was ending this</p>
