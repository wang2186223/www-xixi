                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud piercing groan filled the house drawing me out of my unconsciousness. I opened my eyes slowly. The two men stood at my front pointing the gun around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hear the scream?&#34; The white-haired one asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh,&#34; the other one signaled to him as they kept quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could have made that noise or maybe they had other captives. I sat up and looked over my naked body. I did not try hiding my body. I am sure they must have seen enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The groan came again. This time it was louder. They rushed downstairs leaving me on the wet cold floor. Gunshots followed. I am sure whoever tried to break through their house would not survive this because the bullets they fired were many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bullet was followed by a loud silence from both sides. After a while, I heard a heavy footstep approaching. It was likely to be a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I prayed whosoever found them did not get me. Maybe another enemy or someone who wanted Luna dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened and he walked inside and searched around the room before he made his way to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open and I closed my eyes as fear overtook me. Then the scent hit my nose, I don&#39;t think I can ever forget that scent. So masculine and addictive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt him walk towards me, his Shadow hovering around me. He knelt before me immediately and his hand touched me. I shivered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cupped my cheek hitting me a little &#34;Lia!    Lia open your eyes&#34; he said with a low desperate pleading voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes to meet his tear-stained eyes. Why did he come? I mean it is not like he cares for me or anything. Or maybe he needed me to fulfill my duty as his Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia. Lia, are you okay?   he asked. His voice is deep with concern or maybe a fake concern. I sat upright. He shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Answer me. Say something&#34; he pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I said and sat up. He heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You scared me, &#39;&#39;he said in a hoarse voice. I raised an eyebrow. There was no need for pretense. We both knew he felt nothing for me. I tried to stand up with the little strength I had but fell back to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Luca, he looked older and his mouth was stained with blood. &#34;Where are your clothes? Did they hurt you?&#34; he asked as he searched around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. I am sure it will be so were around&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes searched around the bathroom but it was not there. He dashed to the room and soon came back with the clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you wear it alone?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him. Even if I could not wear it alone I would never allow him to touch me, not after what he did. He was the one that made them kidnap me. If he was around none of this could have happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to change?&#34; I told him with a weak cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was washed with sadness. He took one final step at me and left. I took my time to wear my clothes. I leaped outside to meet him at the door wearing a worried face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved forward to help me but I raised my palm to the air signaling him to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia are-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door burst open with the men. They rushed towards me. One wrapped his arms around my neck as he pointed a gun toward my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear crept into me. Don&#39;t tell me I am about to die. I thought he had already taken care of them before coming to get me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca glared at Lorenzo. Lorenzo returned his glare with a smile. &#34;Let her go,&#34; Luca warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo burst into laughter, he kept on laughing as he pointed fingers at Luca. He stopped for a while and continued laughing then his expression turned cold. His eyes were emotionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be a fool to think that you can order me around. It is either you release Dean or we kill her&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s hands balled into a fist. He growled loudly as his eyes turned into two different colors. He advanced towards Lorenzo. They fought for a while until Luca took over his weight on top of LLorenzo and punched him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men had already wasted all their bullets towards them. He advanced the other one and bit his neck, sucking his blood as the boy writhed in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he was done. The other one faced him with fear. His eyes widened as his skin grew pale. He rushed towards the door but Luca outsmarted him. Luca snapped his neck and drank his blood as he did to the other one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrenaline rushed within me at the sight of this man. His eye gradually changes back to its usual color, blood still dripping off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of who he was scared me but the thought that he had shown his true nature because of me warmed my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He advanced towards me breathing heavily, his white shirt soaked with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me as his eyes softened. He cupped my cheek and this time I did not flinch. I let his warm hands warm my face.``Look I am sorry for my reaction earlier on and I know you have every right to be mad at me but I am deeply sorry&#34;  he apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;Is okay,&#34; I replied. I don&#39;t think I can ever be angry with this side of Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me for a while as if he tried to read my expression then in a split moment he carried me to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds passed, his eyes fixed on the road. &#34;You are a reaper?&#34; I said more of a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His muscles tightened. He looked at me and then at the road. &#34;Yes. I discovered it when I turned into a hybrid,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;Does Dean know?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he did not know but I am sure he will know now. Lorenzo will tell him once I release him&#34;  he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So in conclusion, Luca was a hybrid, and not just a hybrid he was a reaper. A very dangerous combination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately we entered I felt an uneasy feeling. We entered the parlor. My jaw dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean sat on the throne with Sabrina by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca laughed. &#34;Seriously?&#34; He asked. I was sure his question was directed at Sabrina but why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A guard stabbed Luca, he shouted with great pain as he fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Luca and then at Dean and I immediately knew I was in great trouble and no one was going to save me.</p>
