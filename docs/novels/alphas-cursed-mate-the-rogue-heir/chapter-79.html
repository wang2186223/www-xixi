                <p>Dean pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have always had a hard time trusting Sabrina. She was too cunning, too scheming. Hell! She could convince you to walk into your own trap and you would never find out until you are there and there is no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why I felt fucking insecure when she came and asked that she speak to Luca alone. After so many years I had finally gotten Luca to my side. During this year I had come to discover how cruel he can be if he is angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With him by my side together with Lorenzo, we could withstand anything Jenny had in mind. Because if there was one thing I was sure of is that Jenny had a hidden motive. She did not come back because she was in love with Luca or she missed him. She came back for something and was trying to use Luca&#39;s weakness to get and thankfully Luca had outgrown his bond for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he did not tell me I got to know when he ordered her to stay in the guest house. The Luca I knew would never do that. He would rather die than spend a night without her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think he is still going to be on our side?&#34; Lorenzo asked a few minutes after Sabrina had successfully whisked Luca out of our mist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him and nodded. &#34;He has no one except us,&#34; I said. With Lia gone, he had no one to truly rely on and whether he liked it or not, not, we were family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Dean, you are getting it all wrong. He has Sabrina, he has Jenny and we all know he still has a firm hold on Lia, &#34;he countered anxiously. Fear laced his tone as if he was scared of the possibility of having a dangerous duo formed from Sabrina and Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tempted to believe him, but I refused. I knew that he was trying to play the safe game. He always wanted to be on the safe side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is not like that. He wants us to be united,&#34; I said with a little hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stood up and walked close to me before sitting at my table. &#34;Yes, I would agree with you, but feel that in this case, it is different. Sabrina would stop at nothing to get him to the throne because he resonated with the witches. His mother was her friend&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is on his side and not ours, and don&#39;t even make the mistake of telling me that she is going to be on our side if Luca is with us. It would be a big lie. She despises you. You wanted her dead at a point. We can&#39;t afford to be too trustful. There is already a hybrid lurking in the shadows. We have Jenny and the witches all fighting for the throne. Let&#39;s not forget that you could not produce an heir. Your reign is threatened,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back in my chair as I absorbed what he said. Even though Luca wanted peace, Sabrina could not convince him to do otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what would you have me do?&#34; I asked, clearly tired. I wanted peace, wanted the former bond we had with Luca and not the current one. Sometimes I miss him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Firstly, you would look for a wife, someone who could bear an heir for you, and then you find a way to get on Sabrina&#39;s good side. We are supernatural, but they hold us together,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door disrupted our discussion. Lorenzo walked back to his seat while I asked whoever was there to come in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, revealing Sabrina. I curled my hands into a fist as I stared at him. What did she want from us?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She strolled in with her usual smile. &#34;What do you want?&#34; Lorenzo asked in a sharp tone. Thank goodness. I wasn&#39;t the only one who found her annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to inform you that there are whispers everywhere,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow. Whispers about what? They never got tired of whispering. Or was she just here to pull my leg? I shook my head as I pushed the thought away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About what?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About the crown and the legitimacy of the crown. They feel you are weak to allow an enemy to take your wife all in the name of him. Being her mate. And also the hybrid has started killing more people on the outskirts of the town. Go for a walk tomorrow morning and you will find out that half of the people would not respect you the way they usually do. They now see you as a failure,&#34; she said in a mocking tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nostrils flared as I tried hard not to believe her. She could be lying. The people can&#39;t see me as weak. I was too strong for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you telling me?&#34; I inquired, knowing fully well that she never loved me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged. Inquired, &#34;I just felt like sharing it with you to disrupt whatever evil thought you have of killing Luca. If he gets hurt now, they would see you as a tyrant. So guide him from you, your beta, and Jenny,&#34; she said, then bowed slightly. &#34;My alpha,&#34; she said and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately she left Lorenzo banged his fist on the table,&#34; a &#34;moment I thought the table would crack from his force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That twat is playing a scheming game,&#34; she needs to go. She is trying to protect Luca after poisoning his mind against us and we can&#39;t do anything about it&#34;, he complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, too tired to reply. I knew whatever she was saying was true. It could be a cloud by Finn. To mock me by taking my wife from me. At first, I was not bothered because I did not have a bond with her., and Luca did. That was why he was devastated and I was not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I can&#39;t be weak before people. I needed to do something. I needed to do something about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to look at Lorenzo, who was still pouring his hatred for Sabrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to act fast. My father was feared and respected and I want the same for myself&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He furrowed his eyebrow as he tried to detect what I was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to bring back Lia. She is my wife&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you gone mad? How do you expect Luca to react to Lia and Jenny with him?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will have to forgo one,&#34; I said and added, &#34;Ask one of our maids to get Luca&#39;s phone. I need to send a message to her through his phone. I need to talk to her,&#34; I said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is going to be Finn&#39;s wife,&#34; Lorenzo said, trying to convince me to change, but I disagreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet. For now, she is still my wife and I need to see her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Finn is not going to let you in,&#34; he said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, not like I care. &#34;He would not know that I am out. Now do,&#34; I ordered in a curt voice, stopping him from probing further.</p>
