                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel his footsteps pursuing me. &#34;Lia, I am talking to you!&#34; He shouts as he tries to catch up with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I break into a run. I have to get to my room on time without him following me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I get into my room I lock the door. I press my back against the cold door and gradually squat on the ground. Fresh tears flowed more than I thought it would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curl my hand into a small fist as I hit the tilted floor. I have been a fool. A big one to think that a hybrid would ever make me his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I am being truthful I don&#39;t even know what I asked for a divorce. Maybe I was tired of being a side piece. Tired of being Dean&#39;s wife and Luca&#39;s side Chick. I wanted to be someone&#39;s whole option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where they would pick me against anything. I curse under my breath. &#34;Fuck!&#34;I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was wrong with my thinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia open the fucking door!&#34; Luca shouts, hitting the door. His voice seems like a voice that is filled with pain but Luca can&#39;t be pained. He would be jubilating, he just passed a bullet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go away, Luca. Go away!&#34; I scream at him. What does he want to tell me? I love you but I can&#39;t wed you. You are my cousin&#39;s wife but I would love to keep you because your pussy fits into me and swallows my cock like it is made for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe he would issue a live note like most of the boys only that his love confession would be filled without emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No lie. I am not going until I talk to you!&#34; He shouts back, hitting the door the more. The vibration sends warmth to my body, not my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just this morning, he had fucked me my pant is still in his room. Maybe he has thrown them away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of guilt mixed with shame rushed through me. I would have just stayed with Dean as his wife. Even though I do not love him, at least I have a child for him. I am meant to be securing Merlin&#39;s place in the palace; instead, I feel like a heartless rogue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rush to my phone and dial Dean&#39;s number while I have the chance to do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia I am about to break this door so if you are there either you leave or you open the door. I would not want you to get hurt!&#34; He shouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurt indeed. He has already shattered my heart beyond repair. What else does he want, or maybe he does not understand the meaning of hurt.?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang! Bang! I can feel his full weight against the door as he tries to break in. I look at Dean&#39;s number with shaky hands. It is ringing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes as I say a one-minute prayer. Please moon goddess. Let him pick before Luca enters. Before he convinced him against me and my child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, lia?&#34; he asks as he picks up the call, and the door falls open. Luca walks inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason, I grow cold feet about what I am about to do. How would Luca feel? Then I remembered what he said. There is no way he is going to feel bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, I am a very busy person. What do you want?&#34; He is lacking impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca furrows his eyebrow, confusion laced over his face as he mouths, &#34;What are you doing? &#34; to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I am sorry-&#34; I begin, but Luca snatches the phone for me, smashing it on the wall. O  as I watch my phone on the floor with a broken screen. I don&#39;t even think I can repair that screen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were you about to do?&#34; He asked me. His voice was laced with anger and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cross my hands around my chest. &#34;What do you want?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bend my head to avoid me from staring at him. I seem to be filled with desire anytime I do so, especially with the fact that he is currently sweaty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, I am asking you a question! What were you about to do? Tell Dean that you are sorry and what?&#34; He shouts at me, his voice echoed around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger well up within me. He lost the right to shout at me when he did what he did just now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! I wanted to tell him that I was sorry and that I would not want to divorce him. At least with all I have done, he has never asked me to divorce him. He tolerates the fact that I am having an affair with his cousin, and he is my child&#39;s father, which you are not and would never be!&#34; I shout back at him. Frustration is breeding in my veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of anger passed through his eyes &#34;Really?&#34; He asks his voice low with pain. &#34;I might not be his father but I have sacrificed my life for him. Do you think Dean is going to accept you with his child? He does not even recall that night of you guys together. And do you know why he would never value you or even treat you right?&#34; He asks me, his face a few meters away from mine as he stares into my soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know what you want. He is the father of your child today, and by tomorrow, he is not. He is a twat today but you want him on your bed tomorrow. You want a divorce today, you don&#39;t want a divorce at the moment. You loved me yesterday, you don&#39;t love me today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I loved you! I loved you. That was why I asked for a divorce. That was why I shamelessly offered myself to you, but each time I do that, you remind me that I am just a piece of trash. I loved you but you don&#39;t! &#34;I snapped at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who does he think he is to ask me to tell me I don&#39;t know what I want? He clearly does not value me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Lia! I even told him that I want you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped my lips. &#34;You want me but don&#39;t want to get married to me. You want to keep fucking me with no strings attached!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! He curses under his breath as he takes his veiny hands in his black shining hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never warned me. You just announced it. I needed time to think and I would have said yes Liao. I would have said yes. Of course, I want to spend my life with you, travel with you around the whole wolf lands, take you on your fancy date, and share your annoying room with you. I want to do all that and I will so I am begging you, Lia, do not lose faith in us&#34; he pleaded.</p>
