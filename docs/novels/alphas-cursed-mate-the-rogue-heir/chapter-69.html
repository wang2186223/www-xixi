                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called Daina and watched as she arranged my clothes for my departure. I haven&#39;t seen Dean ever since Finn came. Guess he never cared for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door interrupted my packing session. &#34;Come in,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, revealing Lorenzo. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes and ask him out. What had he come here to do? To ask me out of the palace, if that was the case I already knew because Finn was waiting for me outside, or maybe he had come to rub it on my face and call me a whore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I focused on zipping my luggage while the silence existed. &#34;If you are here to watch me leave, I would advise that you go because it is not going to help. I might as well snatch your head since I am leaving&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed a little and took a quick glance at my room. His eyes filled with something like pain or regret before it landed on mine again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could stay, you know. We could fight him. After all, you have already rejected him.&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened. Is this the same Lorenzo I had always known or is my mind playing mind games with me? What changed? I thought he hated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you can&#39;t stay with us. Stay for Luca. He needs you,&#34; He said in a pleading tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed. &#34;He has a mate. I have a mate. I see no reason he should be missing me when he has someone warming his bed,&#34; I said as I took my frame from the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heaved a sigh &#34;Lia, you know that there is some bond that is stronger than mate bond.&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped my lips as I turned my attention towards him again. &#34;What do you gain from my stay?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;Luca was my friend before all this incident. I have never actually seen him this broken,&#34; he informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is acting strong but we all know the bond between them is over,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain clutched my heart at the reminder of Luca&#39;s pained expression even after he kissed me, but he will get over it and move on. After all, he had always kept some part of himself for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will be fine, Lorenzo. You should be happy that you are finally getting rid of the whore,&#34; I said, giving him a sad smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled back and gave me a weak smile. &#34;I just feel your going would bring doom, but goodbye,&#34; he said and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daina carried my luggage. I took one last look at the room before leaving. I wonder if Jenny would be the one to take over the room after I am gone. Maybe Luca would make love to her instead of fucking me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean, Lorenzo, and everyone stood around the hall, watching me as I rolled my luggage. I scanned the room for Luca, but he was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh paint paved my heart. Was he so anxious to go that he could not wait for me to leave before going to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean walked towards me and hugged me before whispering into my ear, &#34;He said I should tell you goodbye. He hopes you guys come back once again. And for The first time I am in support of you Guy&#39;s reunion,&#34; he said with a little chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled me out of the hug and gave me a kiss on my head before walking away. Maid putting on the Finn park uniform,&#34; came to carry my bag, but Daina held it tight to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would follow you,&#34; she said firmly. Her voice was laced with pleading and loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daina-&#34; I began, but she cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, my Luna. Please,&#34; she pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. Since she actually wanted to follow me, besides, I needed someone by my side. Besides, I was going to start a new life elsewhere, and I knew no one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart dropped elsewhere because of all this preparation. Merlin had not crossed my mind. Would Finn be okay with him coming? No. He would never want him, and Merlin&#39;s presence would cause a problem in the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he was Dean&#39;s problem child. I would beg Benedicta to stay with him till everyone was settled, but I needed to stop at her place before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; Finn called. He was standing behind me. I turned to him. &#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; he said, stretching forth his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to look at Dean and Lorenzo once more. They nodded their heads at me but I did not need their approval. I wanted to see Luca once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if on cue, Luca came outside with Jenny. Our eyes locked for a while. I wanted to hug him, wanted to tell him that we could fight for ourselves. His eyes looked pained, and his blue eyes looked watery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would look after him, myself,&#34; he said, staring at me. I smile a genuine smile for the first time. He smiled back and nodded at me. Signaling me to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh! I never knew I would miss this place. I hadn&#39;t even stayed here for two years but I had already gotten used to the place. I got addicted to Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned towards Finn, who gave me a smile and took my hand. It surprised me that he was so patient with me after all this while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards escorted us with Daina by my side. I entered the car and Finn entered through the other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately we entered, his smile vanished as he looked at me. &#34;We are going to my pack, Lia. You would have to leave everything about Luca behind. You are going to be my wife and Luna, and I really don&#39;t love sharing. It would be good for us if you leave everything behind,&#34; he warned coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;I would like to see a friend,&#34; I informed him</p>
