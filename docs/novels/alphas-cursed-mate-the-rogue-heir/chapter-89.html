                <p>Luca POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I caught sight of the bracelet. I walked towards it immediately. My heart beat faster, let it, not be Merlin. Fuck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I moved toward the boy&#39;s dead body a guard stopped me. &#34;You don&#39;t touch the bodies,&#34; he warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed and my eyes darted to Dean. He nodded telling me to leave the body. What they did not know was that it was Merlin and Lia, that gave me hope for the future. They were the ones who convinced me that I was worth any sacrifice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day Merlin called me dad I was a little bit pissed about it because he was Dean&#39;s child and I felt he was just trying to mess with my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after I and Lia settled our differences, the word Dad bore another vision in me. Suddenly I thought I was not worthy of anything good and found myself wanting to have a kid. Someone who would call me father or give Merlin another sibling although this dream seemed far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me!&#34; I shouted, drawing everyone&#39;s attention. The hall fell silent. My eyes met with Jenny and she gave me the What are you doing look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, I said you should leave them alone. Their bodies have not been identified.&#34; Dean said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curled my hand into a fist as I called on patience to stop me from doing something I did not want to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have someone I am looking for. And I would advise you to let me find him. Don&#39;t try to interrupt me again. You don&#39;t have a kid or even a heart to become a father so you would not know what these people are going through&#34; I retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean glared at me, his veins throbbing from his head and neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca I as the Alpha of this pack am asking you to leave before I do something you don&#39;t like&#34; he growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something like what? You act as if I said a lie that would stand as treason. Do you have the heart of the people?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel everyone&#39;s eyes on me and him. If it was an ordinary day. I would not care but it was Merlin, my son. I cared about him more than anything excluding Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stood up and stood beside Dean. &#34;Luca, he is the Alpha of the pack  leave the place, and besides you are just a..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A rogue. I know! That is why you don&#39;t seem to care about the wants of the people. I am just a rogue. There are rogues here whose children and whose loved ones were attacked. Some wolves lost their loved ones last night and you haven&#39;t even said a word or addressed them. I want to check on a body and you are threatening me. I stopped caring about your threat a long time ago. You can try to do your worst. But ensure that you kill the hybrid if not you will become an  Alpha without a pack&#34; I warned breathing heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s nostrils flared as he looked at me. Then someone from the crowd clapped and then another followed and before you would know it the whole pack was clapping for me. It stopped after a while and they started chanting my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sabrina walked to me with a smile and whispered &#34;Benedicta and Merlin are safe. They are in my house. You can see them&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at her with wide eyes unsure if I could trust her at this moment. She might be trying to pull me out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded &#34;I am serious,&#34; she said. &#34;Now turn to the crowd and bow&#34; she ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows. Why would I bow? I did it anyway. And surprisingly they bowed to me with respect. Chills ran down my spine at the sight. This has never happened to Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked towards the exit, Lorenzo grabbed my hands stopping me on track. &#34;Game on,&#34; he said with a glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately went into my room and got out with my car keys. Sabrina was already waiting by the door by the time I got there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The people have chosen you,&#34; she said immediately after we entered inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped in my tracks to stare at her and then turned to what I was doing before pretending not to hear her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, I am sure you heard me. The people have chosen you&#34; she repeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my tongue from saying something stupid &#34;I heard you the last time. Now put on your seat belt and let us go. I need to see Merlin&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged her lips as she wore her seat belt. &#34;You seem to have grown attached to this boy&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I take him as a son&#34; I admitted. There was no need to hide it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Back to my topic. The people have chosen you. They bowed to you. It seems as if the moon goddess is in your favor&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I doubt I am sure I am the most highly unfavoured human being. First, my mother died at my birth. Then my father died later. My mate slept with my cousin. I found myself falling in love with my cousin&#39;s wife who had a kid for him and was a mate to an enemy pack. Can someone&#39;s life be more miserable? It has succeeded in taking my loved ones from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, Sabrina?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To challenge Dean. If you kill the hybrid, they will let you be their Alpha and you can take Merlin as your heir since you are getting attached to the boy&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at her and then at the road &#34;I am not interested in the throne. The only person I wanted was gone. He can have the throne&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head &#34;That is what you would say now but time will tell&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at her and then at the road. What was she trying to say? I can&#39;t be the Alpha. They would not accept either a rogue or a hybrid as their Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But first I needed to find what the hybrid wanted and stop him or warn him not to touch the people I love.</p>
