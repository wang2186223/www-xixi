                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t want you or Dean, she wants the throne,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca narrowed his eyes to a split &#34;And where is this coming from?&#34; He asked with a bit of impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is what it looks like from the deal she made with Finn. She wants the throne,&#34; I explained in a pleading voice, praying that he was going to get me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at me and tilted his head the other way. A chuckle escaped his lips. &#34;If this is about me and you I have told you that I did not touch her. We don&#39;t let our mates touch us until we don&#39;t have feelings for each other. So don&#39;t try to make Jenny look like a bad guy here. I know you don&#39;t like her, and you don&#39;t want her around me, but saying she wants the throne? It&#39;s kind of selfish&#34; he said in a light tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger welled within me. I was seriously trying to save his life and all he could think about was that I was jealous. That I am being selfish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am trying to save you, not being jealous. We have gotten over each other&#39;s jealousy. I want you to be happy. I don&#39;t want you to fall into her trap&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scanned my face for a while and took a deep breath. &#34;Look, Lia, I know you are worried about me, but this is not going to happen. We both know that females can&#39;t become Alphas&#34; he explained as he took a sip of his drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration boiled within me. I was trying to help him and all he wanted to do was make me look foolish. I hated the fact that he was so nonchalant about the issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want to drink?&#34; He asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him. &#34;We are not eating or drinking until we are done with this topic&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What topic lia. If it is about Jenny, it is over. I have already told you that females don&#39;t become Alpha&#34; he said with a hint of impatience lurking around his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat upright making sure he was looking at me. &#34; See it this way. She gets married to you, or Dean gets pregnant, kills Dean,, and claims she is carrying his child. She becomes the Alpha because Dean has an heir&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a long sip from his milkshake. &#34;Dean already has an heir, which is Merlin. And she can&#39;t kill me and Dean. They don&#39;t kill royals that way. And besides I am not going to get married to her neither is Dean&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curled my fist and gritted my teeth &#34;Merlin is not a legitimate heir. She could kill him if she gets to know and just watch sooner than later she will start asking you to marry her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was really annoying that he was not even trying to get me or know where I was coming from. Or has she also started manipulating him as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has already done that,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows &#34;Done what?&#34; I asked, my heartbeat increased. Was he talking about marriage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already asked me to marry her but I refused,&#34; he said nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What annoyed me most about this whole conversation was his nonchalance. I knew he never took anything seriously except it was about me, but he should try to understand me and at least let me know that he got what I was saying. He sees her as an enemy, too, and he would do everything to make sure that she does not sit on the Attic&#39;s throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged, &#34;I told her no. We both know I cannot live with her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh of relief and leaned back into my chair, massaging my head. She was already moving faster than we thought she would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you think she wants the throne and not me? Who told you that? I mean, she can&#39;t just come back from the dead and want the throne,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head &#34;I know. But Annabel-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is Annabel&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My maid&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm. So you think whatever she is saying is the Truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hit my hand lightly on the table. &#34;Let me talk. Stop making assumptions&#34; I instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She said during the years. Jenny used to visit Finn. They are friends. You know Finn said he would give us three days he came that same day and took me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm. I remember&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;Good. It was because she told him that I was fucking you. She even gave him photos of us in the museum and got a maid from your palace who sent her a photo of us spending time together in the palace. She did that so that she could initiate Finn to take me away. If Finn took me away you would have no choice but to be with her. She is either going to kill you or stab you and make Dean make love to her and maybe kill him and don&#39;t tell me she would not be able to seduce Dean. We both know he would fuck anything that does not have a dick. Maybe she would kill you or let you leave. I don&#39;t know, but I promise you, Luca, that she did not come for good. Believe me&#34;. I pleaded softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would kill me if something happened to him, especially with the fact that I was not there to do anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about this?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I nodded and showed him the photos she sent to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A curse escaped his lips immediately when he saw the photos of us in the museum. We were having sex when she took the photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This bloody twat. I will deal with her!&#34; He shouted, his muscles tightened with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took his palm Into mine and gave it a soft squeeze. &#34;Please be careful. I don&#39;t want anything to happen to you&#34; I implored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fell on my face. He nodded. He knew I was serious. He knew I would not be able to take it if anything happened to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s talk about Merlin. I am thinking of taking him to the palace&#34; he said.</p>
