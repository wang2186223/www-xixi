                <p>&#34;I thought you were not going to come,&#34; she said as she turned to me with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you think you were going to do?&#34;I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged and tilted her head towards Dean&#39;s direction. &#34;I was raising another ally. since you decided to fail me&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nostrils flared, and  I shoved my fist into my pocket. Can&#39;t believe she was about to release Dean. Of all the people, Dean!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you decided to make your next ally my brother?&#34;</p>

                <p>I scoffed and turned around the room for a while. I stopped a few meters away from her, my hands on my waist as I called on patience. Because I could seriously snap this woman&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious? My brother! Dean who has insisted that the witches are not meant to be human? You decide to raise him to destroy me. Seriously Sabrina, what the fuck is wrong with you?&#34; I asked my voice above the rooftop. I took in shaky breaths as I tried to control my anger, I could feel my veins throbbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face turned into a little frown. She pointed her fingers towards me, her eyes dark &#34;Firstly you do not shout at me. Secondly, I would make anybody my ally since you decided to be a disappointment&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrowed my eyes to a split, my voice dark with range &#34;Me? A disappointment?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes, increasing the anger within me. How on earth did I not see this side of her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes my Alpha&#34; she replied, her tone laced with mockery as she mockingly bowed to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed &#34;Me an imbecile. Have you taken a good look at yourself?&#34;I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger passed through her. &#34;What do you mean?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged and took a step back &#34;You know what I mean&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am trying to save you, Luca. I am trying to make you the Alpha you have always dreamt of. With Lia and Merlin, you will never be the Alpha. Your blood will never be the heir&#34; she replied her voice low as she tried to make me see reasons with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter if my son sits there if it&#39;s not Lia&#39;s son. So let me save her.&#34; I pleaded and moved towards her and held her arms &#34;She will die if we don&#39;t help&#34; I pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at me for a while and gradually removed my hands from her arms. &#34;If you cross this gate, I will turn my back against you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed her threat &#34;If you turn against me. You and your kind will suffer especially if Dean gets to know that you helped me&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We glared at each other for a while, our eyes screaming anger and rage. She walks away and bangs the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take one more glance at Dean and lock the door with my key. I have already been able to track Lia&#39;s location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurry downstairs and get into my car to drive to her location.  What if Sabrina comes in and helps Dean while I am away? What will I do? I ask myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a minute I am tempted to stay back and heed Sabrina&#39;s warning but then Lia&#39;s face flashes through my mind. Her blue eyes, her laughter, her soft lips. Gosh! I tighten my grip around my steering as heat well up through my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stretched a little to relieve myself of whatever tension that had flowed to my groin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pack my car at the location. It is surprising a modern building unlike most of the kidnappers who hide their victims in creepy, cobwebbed places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step outside and move towards the building holding my gun. I push the gate open and it opens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold creeps into me. Why do I feel like this is a trap? I ask myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The building is two-storied. I don&#39;t even know what floor she is on. Gosh! This feels like a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decide to follow my guts, I can already feel eyes on me. The only reason why I came alone was because I knew that this was what they wanted. Unknowingly to them I am a hybrid, I cannot be killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I entered the door shut behind me. I turn around to face Lorenzo who has a cigarette trapped in between his lips. He has an amused smirk on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He inhales for a while before he exhales &#34;You know I told Lia that you were going to come and she said no. She called you a selfish person who did not love her. But here you are&#34; his tone is lacking with mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart drops at the thought of those words. Did she think that about me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s eyes changed into gold color as his teeth drew out. I burst into laughter. For fuck sake he is a wolf, I would tear him apart in one bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jumps on me and bites me on my neck. &#34;Argh,&#34; I wrote in pain. I roll over making him be on top of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growl as my eyes change into gold and red. His eyebrow furrows as he takes in his teeth &#34;You are a hybrid?&#34; He asks. His voice was laced with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tilt my head &#34;Surprise?&#34; I asked him and bit his neck. He screamed harder, two men in black who I immediately guessed were lia kidnappers rushed downstairs and started shooting at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t flinch but focus on Lorenzo making sure I inflict more pain on him. When I am done drinking some of his blood I leave him, even though I am thirsty for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now tell me where she is?&#34; I ask him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He points upstairs. Without wasting time I rush up to meet Lia. I open the first door, which is a bedroom. I burst into all the rooms and to the last one which is a bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia is lying on the floor unconscious. Her skin is pale and worst of all she is naked. My eyes move to the bathtub beside her which is filled with ice. Let it not be what I am thinking.</p>
