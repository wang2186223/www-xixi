                <p>Lia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell is he doing here? How the hell did he get in here without their notice? I thought I told him to give me two weeks. I turn around to see Dean glaring at me. I return it with a smile. I look towards Dean&#39;s direction but he is nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I search around the crowd with my eyes, he is not there. Was I hallucinating?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goosebumps creep into my skin at the thought of our last encounter. How deep his voice was, how soft his hands were, or how clean his chest was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head and steady myself. I can&#39;t think of a Finn at this moment although he is my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner than later they start playing classical songs in the background. I have always hated classical songs,  they seemed too boring, and too slow for me and they came with a little melodrama between couples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For those who were in love, they would spend time professing feelings to one another for couples like me and Dean who would rather die than stay in the same room.  It was torture,  cruel torture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But we had to do it. If we did not our people would not be pleased. I was sure he was going to promise me hell for sending his concubine away but it was high time he knew that if he did not allow me to have my peace I would seize his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean offers me his hands and I take it as we make our way to the centre of the hall prepared for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately we take our bow, we start dancing. He wraps his arms around my waist drawing me closer to his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you are doing?&#34; He asks as he leans forward into my ear and whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lower my eyebrows feigning ignorance. &#34;What do you mean my Lord? &#39;&#39; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hiss &#34;Don&#39;t play dumb with me Lia&#34; he says as he turns me around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe if you tried to explain more I would understand what you are talking about&#34; I replied to him with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, and he squeezed my waist maybe to cause me pain which was not going to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What you did do out there with Sasha&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh!&#34; I reply with a smile as if I am just remembering what I did. &#34;I gifted the widowed Luna a gift&#34; I reply</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And it had to be Sasha, hun?&#34;  he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It could be anybody&#34;  I reply and add with a mocking voice. &#34;But I have zero tolerance for prostitutes so I decided to give her out&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grits his teeth. I can tell I am successfully getting on his nerves. Something I am doing with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may think sending Sasha away will make me look at you but just know that you are highly mistaken. I would never be drawn to someone like you&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words pierce me a little, just a little. &#34;We are on the same spot, Alpha. I too would never be drawn to someone like you but I am your Luna. Like it or not you have obligations to me&#34; and added &#34;I would rather die than lay in bed with you&#34; I reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door to the hall opens at once revealing an angry Luca. Our eyes meet for a while and I smile, and he nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean!&#34; He shouted his voice echoing round the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean halted and looked at me &#34;What have you done*he ask in a whisper</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What do you mean.?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did he get up?&#34; He asks with a lethal voice and a glaring eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrug with a smile &#34; I don&#39;t know &#34; I reply to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca walks towards him, and the guard rushes towards him pointing all sorts of weapons at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glares at all of them and at Dean &#34;Tell them to leave my way or&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or what?&#34; Dean asks as he strolls toward him. &#34;What will you do? Kill them? But you can&#39;t because you are a rogue? And even if you were a wolf, you had too much injury to fight&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca starts laughing, and to everyone&#39;s surprise, he looks at Dean and keeps on laughing for a long time. The guards lower their guns and stare at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a split second, he shot one of them. Press one against his chest with a knife pressed to his neck. The people around gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner than later they start leaving the hall one after the other, slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do anything stupid and I will cut his head off&#34; he warns breathing heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca don&#39;t you dear!&#34; Dean warns. They glare at each other for a while and Dean signals his men to drop their weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They drop their arms waiting for him. Surprisingly he slit the head of the man and watched as the skull fell on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood fills his white shirt and the rug. Everyone immediately leaves. Left with only us and Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is for daring to use your weaklings to threaten me, &#34; he says with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean clenches his fist &#34;What do you want&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34;  he says and turns to me &#34;Follow me&#34; I nod and walk towards him but Dean stops me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is my Luna. Not yours&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s muscles tighten &#34;We both know that that is a lie. Let her go or I will do something terrible&#34; he warns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean let go of my hand, I smiled inwardly as I walked towards Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately promised myself to give myself out to someone this evening.</p>
