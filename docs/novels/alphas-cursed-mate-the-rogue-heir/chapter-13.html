                <p>I lay on the bed, eyes opened throughout the night. I did not even bother sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind kept racing back to what Luca said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merlin had almost been attacked. Hope Lexie was okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At four o&#39;clock I stood up and started pacing around the room. Once it was five o&#39;clock I would go to Lexie&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused thoughts ran through me. Merlin has never been attacked. Up until now, I had succeeded in keeping Merlin a secret from everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one knew about him. So how come the first night I spent in the palace, they attacked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only meant someone knew about Merlin&#39;s father. The only person who knew about it was Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Luca be the one who tried to hurt him? I mean how did he know he was about to be attacked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. Luca would never want to hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He might not want to hurt you but remember he is Dean&#39;s enemy. His anger might hurt Merlin,&#34; my wolf said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time she was talking to me since the night they unlocked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled with courage, I now had someone to be around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think it might be?&#34; I asked my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; she replied in a sad voice. Obviously, she was sad that my child was in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think Dean is suspicious of you and Luca after the affection you showed his cousin,&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it was going to make us seem suspicious but I could not control my emotions yesterday. Luca was the only one I felt comfortable around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately it was 5 o&#39;clock and I wore my dress. A pair of trousers and a white shirt left my room and walked towards the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards stood in front of the gate with a stoic face. Their overly body-built body hovered over me as they tried to intimidate me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move out of my way. I need to see someone.&#34; I said with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Alpha has insisted one of us follow you if you are going out,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed, Dean can&#39;t be serious. I knew he was doing it because of what happened yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was trying to find out whatever we were hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coward! He will never know anything about me and my loved ones after all he hated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms over my chest &#34;I don&#39;t want to go with a guard I can go on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They remained in the same position as one of them spoke, &#34;Then I am afraid we can&#39;t allow you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to push them away but they did not flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ahhh! I hated Alpha Dean with my life. I needed to see Merlin even though today was my wedding day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at them for the last time and made my way inside blind with rage and fear when I bumped into a hard chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up with relief, it was Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his eyebrows as he asked &#34;Are you going somewhere?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, &#34;I was but your annoying Cousin told his guards to make sure I don&#39;t leave this palace without them.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it about Mer?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded with a smile. I like the fact that he gave Merlin a nickname.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to see if he is fine,&#34; I added with a low pleading voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me for a while and heaved a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took hold of my hands and we went to his car. He opened the door for me and I entered. I beamed with a smile at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard remained standing at the front of the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard stood by the gate, &#34;You can&#39;t take her with you,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On whose orders?&#34; He asked his voice deep with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Dean,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca took in deep breaths and looked at me &#34;Whatever you do. Don&#39;t panic and know that I will never hurt you,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded wondering what he was going to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open the gates or I will blow you off,&#34; he threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver ran down my spine at his threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood there untouched. He drew a gun from the back of his pocket and shot them on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed the button as the gate rolled out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He entered his car and banged the car door. I watched with awe as he turned on the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he just kill for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; He asked his eyes on the road that led to Lexi&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spared me a glance, his eyes lingered on my top, his jaws tightened and then he looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not scared about what just happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. You will never hurt me.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little smile appeared on his lips, &#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A comfortable silence evolved around us as I took my time to take in the intricate details of his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a tight long shirt that enhanced his muscles. His black shining hair was perfectly combed with some strands falling on his forehead. His perfectly curved heart-shaped lips made it irresistible for me to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you are going to be committing adultery anytime soon,&#34; my wolf spoke from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded with a smile, my skin lit with fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me but I made Benedicta do a spell around Lexie&#39;s house. That was how I knew he was being attacked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder he knew about the attack and here I was suspecting him. The car stopped at Lexie&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will drive off to Benedict&#39;s house while you go in. Dean might send people to follow me and I want them to think we are with Benedicta&#39;&#39; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded with a smile. &#34;Thank you,&#34; I said and sneaked into  Lexie&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I opened the door and Merlin rushed towards me and jumped on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The man who came that day. He saved me. They wanted to kill me,&#34; he said in a low shivering voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hugged him tight as I caressed his hair. &#34;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m here&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lexie walked towards me. With watery eyes. Gosh, she must be so scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The ruthless rogue was the one who saved us. There were five. They wanted to kill Merlin but somehow he killed three. Two ran away.&#34; Lexie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; I apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s okay. Just be careful,&#34; she said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent the last hour with Merlin. Immediately Luca honked at me and I bade goodbye to Merlin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started crying. He did not want to leave me. He was so scared. I consoled him and promised to be back and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride back home was silent. Luca seemed tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately we got into the palace. The guard stood in front of us. &#34;The Alpha wants to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca nodded and we walked inside the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s father together with all the royal members stood there staring at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did the both of you visit a witch this morning?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank into my chest. It meant Benedicta was in trouble</p>
