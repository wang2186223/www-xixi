                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours passed by and the most anticipated moment came. I finished taking my bath and watched as two maids dressed me. Dean had sent two other people to dress me up. Which was strange. Maybe he was expecting a very important person or maybe the moon goddess was paying a visit. Whatever he had in mind remained a mystery to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as they did my makeup carefully and wore my accessories. Ava, one of the maids, took out the necklace from the jewelry box and wore it on my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt heavy, too heavy to wear with an already suspicious husband. If need be I needed to be as light as I could in case he decided to kill me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remove it. It&#39;s too heavy&#34; I complained, trying to remove it on my own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, but you can&#39;t. Alpha Dean had made us promise that you would wear everything he sent to you&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hiss escaped my mouth. What the hell was he trying to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her &#34;Well as your Luna I am telling you to remove it&#34; I said with a stern voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent with my outburst. Ava flinched at my outburst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But- she began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Don&#39;t make me repeat myself,&#34; I replied. She removed it quickly and put it back into the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go,&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at me with surprise and I returned with a glare. She bowed her head and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest finished their work in complete utter silence making sure they followed my instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened revealing a well-dressed Dean. Everyone bowed their heads except me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you done with the makeup?&#34; he asked my servant. She nodded and he dismissed them leaving only me and him in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked Dean while putting on my shoe since he had decided to dismiss all my maids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you refused to put on the jewelry I sent to you. So I brought you a much lighter customized diamond according to your taste&#34; he said and placed it on the front of my dressing table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the box. A gasp escaped my mouth at the sight of the jewelry. It looked so beautiful with my name spelled on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like it?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did I like it? Yes. Was I going to tell him that I loved it? No. Why? Because it would mean that I had decided to accept whatever truce he was offering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it is impressive but it doesn&#39;t mean I like it. Though I would love to keep it&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crept to his lips &#34;Good&#34; he said and added. &#34;Now that you are done with your dressing. Can we go?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows. Since when did we start arriving at parties together? What would Finn think if he saw me and him like this? Looking all happy. Would he get jealous? No, he would not. He knew that he could be killed. My mind went back to Luca. I was pretty sure that if he was here he would do something to make everyone know that I belonged to him. A smile crept on my lips at the thought of his possessiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May I know what is occupying the mind of my beloved wife?&#34;Dean asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and walked towards the door. His sweet words were like stinging my ear. &#34; Your cousin&#34; I replied and watched his reaction. His eyes darkened, his jaw clenched but he did a good job by trying to keep a blank face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stretched forth my hands towards me &#34;Shall we?&#34; I asked. He glared at my hands before taking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His guards and maid followed us at our back as we made our way towards the hall. The crowd&#39;s shouts increased as we walked in. We both waved our hands to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the eerie feeling crept in. The hair at the back of my neck stood, and goosebumps crept into my body. Someone was watching me or rather, Finn was watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat in our seats beside each other. Dean kept his hands enclosed in mine throughout the time and it caused me great difficulty to move or do anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned towards his ear and whispered &#34;You are making me feel uncomfortable&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled his attention still on the wonderful dancers who were entertaining us. &#34;You are my wife lia, a fact you seem to have forgotten so I will do everything to remind you of it even if it means holding your hands throughout the event. You need to get that infatuation you feel towards Luca away&#34; he replied harshly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed and smiled. Whatever he was trying to do was not going to get to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If this is your attempt to deceive me into thinking that you are jealous. Then I would love to tell you that you have failed drastically&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his grip around me. Sooner than later the dancers stopped dancing and they started playing classical music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took my hands and led me to the dance floor. My feet grew cold as all the eyes fell on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wrapped his arm around my waist and drew me closer to himself. &#34;What are you trying to do?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trying to win my wife over,&#34; he said with a smile. An uneasy feeling crept into my core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We danced for a while, and everyone&#39;s eyes rested on us. Then he drew me closer and whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t give two fucks about whatever is going on between you and Luca but it has to stop. If it does not stop I will have his neck for it. You are my wife and it is time you start performing your duty and that includes bearing my kids&#39; &#39;he whispered harshly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled a little to hide the anger that was building within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately the songs stopped. I walked towards my seat without wasting any more time. I raised my eyes and it locked with Finn down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned in frustration and took a glass of wine from the servant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heartbeat increased, and anger welled up within me. How dare he threaten me with Luca&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May I talk to you?&#34; he said and dragged my hands towards the door. As he dragged me my head started spinning, his arms wrapped around my waist. &#34;Easy girl. I need you to be alive. I like loud lively moans&#34; he whispered against my ear and at that moment I knew that I had been drugged.</p>
