                <p>Fire erupted on my skin as he moved his hands to the other nipple and brushed it a little bit making it harden the more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moans of pleasure escaped my mouth as he moved his hands to the other one and brushed it for a while before squeezing the other hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was wet. God, I wanted his tongue on my skin anywhere but not my mouth. I wanted him to lips my nipple till I cum but for some reason, he avoided direct contact with my nipples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just played with them, making me anticipate and this anticipation was driving me crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca..&#34; I begged. He looked at me with a devilish grin and continued. He sure as hell knew what he was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally moved his tongue to my nipple. I heaved a sigh of relief as he made his way towards my bra. He would finally unlock it and give me the pleasure I wanted, but contrary to my expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used his tongue to caress my nipple through my bra. Making my nipple harden the more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another moan escaped my lips. After a while, he kissed his way back to my neck planting soft wet kisses on my neck while his other hand found his way to my pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he got there,, I was sure my pants were soaked from all the crazy teasing. He felt my wetness, moved his hands up and down around my pants, and then attempted to remove his hands, but I held it. My eyes widened with pleading. He glared at me as I mouthed, please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened &#34;If you want to cum free my hands&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that I released his hand, allowing myself to be at his mercy once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally moved his hands behind my back and unclasped my bra, freeing my pointed pink nipples. He stared at it for a while before he moved his hands to my pants and helped me pull it away. Tossing it into a place I was not sure of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened as they filled with desire and luck. His stare made me feel like the only person there, the only thing around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed me again before his lips moved to my nipples. His mouth finally encircled my nipple, his warmth exciting me the more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, his tongue touched my nipples. Loud moans of pleasure escaped my mouth as his tongue played with it, while his other hands played with the other one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bit it a little not and then hard. Nipples of pleasure pressed through my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved his mouth to the other one and repeated the same circle. Sooner than later the room echoed with my moans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked me up and carried me to his bed and laid me there. He knelt before me and muttered &#34;Beautiful&#34; A pink hue covered my cheeks. We were finally going to have sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He launched towards me and planted soft kisses down my navel until it stopped at my Virgina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went below and started kissing his way up there. I moaned with expectation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He planted soft kisses on my left thigh then licked my clit just once and moved to the right one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he stopped and looked at me. His eyes bore into my soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I fuck you lia, I am going to be the only man that is permitted to touch you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded with anticipation; I doubted if anyone would make me feel this way again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Words, lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one would touch me,&#34; I said in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will be mine and mine alone&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he did not know is that I have been his own since the day he kissed me. I touched myself at night with his face on my mind and I sometimes moaned his name just because I always had a pillow over my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be yours,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not Finn and not Dean. Mine. And If you ever let your mate touch you because of the mate bond. I would kill him not minding if it would cause a war between the two parks,&#34; he warned. His voice is deep with possessiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded even though I was told the mate bond was stronger than the normal one. That was not my business anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he came back to my thighs and planted soft kisses all along. His tongue finally touched my clit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He licked me up taking in all my juice, then he thrust his hands into my pussy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arr..gh&#34; a loud moan escaped my lips. Maybe it was because it had been a long time since I had sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca&#34; I called out as I came close to Cummings. One last thirst with a scream came and he licked me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He removed his grey sweat pants revealing his full length to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped. It was even bigger than I thought. What the fuck? How was that going to fit into my hole?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kneel&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly knelt and took his whole length into my mouth little by little until I was okay with his length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I started sucking him. He groaned as he closed his eyes and laced his hands on top of my hair, grabbing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With time, he started driving deeper and deeper. I could feel his length widen. He was about to cum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he filled my lips with hot liquid. I swallowed everything in and licked the little ones off his dick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good girl,&#34; he muttered. I laid back on his bed and watched as he thrust into my Virgina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped as I tried to take his full length. I closed my eyes for a while. Then he removed it and slid in slowly until I was comfortable before he increased his pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca..l&#34; I called out. I was close to Cumming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let me cum, I cummed thrice before he cum and fell on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were both breathing heavily before our breath steadied. He planted a soft kiss on my lips and murmured,, &#34;You are amazing&#34;, before he rolled to the other side and drew me closer for a cuddle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, a knock came on the door. We both murmured. Who the hell was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca opened the door,, and when he came back,, his face was carrying a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately knew that something was amiss.</p>
