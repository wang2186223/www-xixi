                <p>I took in shaky breaths as I went into the room. I did not know what to do or who to talk to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My so-called mate did not even recognize me as his mate. He looked at me with disdainful eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the Alpha had just ordered my marriage with Dean and he could not even look me in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only person who acted nice to me was Luca and I was not even sure of his intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had threatened my son&#39;s life and had still gone ahead to become close to me. He was so nice to me and made his gaze so intense that it made heat erupt my whole body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head at whatever feeling I was having. He was my husband-to-be cousin and enemy for all I know he could be using me as a pawn in his game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door interrupted my thought. I sat upright and straightened my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fair lady walked inside and greeted me, &#34;Good evening my lady. I am Maguse, your new maid,&#34; she said beaming with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maid? I have not even gotten married and I already had a maid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled back at her, &#34;I am Lia.&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, &#34;I am always at your service. Do you need anything?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet, but I will tell you,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes wandered around the room and landed on my bag of clothes, &#34;I can help you arrange your clothes, while you can ask me any questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her and then at my clothes. She seems to like me. I shrugged and nodded, &#34;Yes. Sure.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately opened the bag and started arranging my clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay on my bed. I took out my phone to text Lexie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am to get married to the Alpha tomorrow. Please don&#39;t let anyone know about Merlin. The Alpha presently hates me,&#34; I texted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure. I will do it. We played a game today. He has already fallen asleep but I did not want to wake him up,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for being a good friend,&#34; I texted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nahh you are the best,&#34; she replied feeling touched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been a good friend. I don&#39;t know what I would have done without her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to come down for dinner or should I send your food,&#34; she asked interrupting my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;Yes, bring my food here.&#34; Besides Dean does not even like me. After a few minutes, she came back with my food and placed it on the table. She nodded and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later someone knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca breezed In as if he owned the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you are already avoiding your husband,&#34; he said with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes and focused on my food. The room suddenly became too hot, his intoxicating scent filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love my personal space,&#34; I replied with my attention still on my food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took two steps closer, his scent becoming more intoxicating. How could I have such a strange feeling for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh! I need this mating ceremony to happen fast before I commit an atrocity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it means I am interrupting your personal space.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; It did not seem like that in the forest,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My skin flushed at the thought of what transpired last night. I closed my eyes as I remembered how his musky breath intoxicated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved closer. His hands touched my jaw as he attempted to make me look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dodged. I can&#39;t look at him. I was afraid that I would lose myself in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia look at me,&#34; he said with a low pleading voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in shaky breaths and looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My room is next to yours. The palace is not the way you seem it to be. So many people want you dead. If you need anything call me,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; He asked his eyebrows farrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why should I trust you? You also want me dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened as he swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I want you dead?&#34; He asked disbelief laced his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, &#34;Yes, after all, you threatened me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed as his jaw tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made you get back your wolf. I would have killed you. That was my intention but not anymore,&#34; he supplied his gaze burned into my soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there is anyone who wants your safety. It is me&#34; he added and took a step back and somehow, the space took something away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze was still on me. He opened the door and came back with a bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed it on my bed. &#34;These are your wedding clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows. Dean was meant to be the one who sent me my clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up from my table and walked towards the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Dean send you?&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head, &#34;Dean can never order me,&#34; he said and opened the bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Red suit you. I bought the dress for you because. You don&#39;t get it. Dean hates you. He will not waste his time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if he does?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head with pity. As if he was secretly mocking my hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wear the one you chose but if he does not put on min,&#34; he said and walked towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood transfigured on the ground. His height hovering around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved a strand of my hair behind my ears. His eye moved to my lips as it darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took hold of my hands and I shivered at his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He removed his eyes from me and pecked my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night sister-in-law,&#34; he said and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in and exhaled a shaky breath as I tried to steady myself at the effects of his space.</p>
