                <p>&#34;We would urge you to give it a rethink&#34;, Ares says as we watch Sabrina leave. I glare at him.</p>

                <p>I nod absentmindedly. The door opens revealing a guard. He walks inside and drops a note on my table before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of anger rushed through me as I stared at the name who delivered the letter. It came from Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened it and began to read it &#34;It has come to my notice that you have a hybrid lurking around. Please endeavor to keep my mate safe or what happened with your mother will be the tip of an iceberg&#34; it read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger surged within me. Who did he think he was to threaten me with all the things in the world after my mother&#39;s death? When he knows he is fully responsible for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he think that I was some weakling that he could just offend and get away with it?  He did not bother to negotiate, just started dashing out orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. In fact, I refuse to let Lia go with him. I would rather kill him than let him take Lia. He made me motherless. I would make him Mateless. If it gets worse, I would make Luca convince her to reject him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha what do you think? Should we send for Sabrina?&#34; Ares asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw clenched as I glared at him. What was his problem? &#34;I said no witches! This meeting is over!&#34; I shouted, stamping my hand on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone flinched at my outburst. They stood up and bowed before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately they closed the door. Lorenzo began to shout, making an irritating noise in my ear. &#34;What was the meaning of that?&#34; he asked. Clearly angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed. In Times like this, I wished to be left alone. I threw the letter at him and he read it. Its face softened for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would he bring your mother&#39;s death to the topic?&#34; He asked in an angry tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. How can he be so immature?&#34;I asked, anger rolling out with my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to call liars,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later I walked in with a stony face. Seriously, does she always have to be frowning or have a stony face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would make her look more old than the way she is. I don&#39;t know what Luca sees in her or what my father saw in her that made him decide she would be my wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a seat beside me and crossed her chest. &#34;Why did you call me?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes to call on patience. She did not even address me as her Alpha. In Times like this I wish she was not so important, getting rid of her would have been easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here I was trying to find a solution for us and she sat there playing away my time being unnecessarily rude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is your Alpha!&#34; Lorenzo shouted at her. He obviously noted the fact that she did not bother greeting me or even bowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cousin is seriously making this girl audacious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And he is my husband,&#34; she said as if we did not know about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took in a shaky breath &#34;You are meant to greet or at least bow&#34; he said in a calm voice. It was obvious that he was trying to control his temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, &#34;yeah, I will try and remember next time,&#34; she said. Meaning, I would not remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to go with Finn when he comes,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw dropped and I could feel Lorenzo&#39;s eyes burning into my skin. This was not what we had planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?. I am not going with him&#34; she said with a glaring face. She squirmed on her chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are going&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not going,&#34; she replied, staring at me into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am your husband&#34;, I reminded her. She rolled her eyes like she seriously rolled her eyes. What audacity!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed &#34;That&#39;s a title. You do not order me,&#34; she said and tried to stand up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do not walk away from me lia!&#34; I shouted my voice echoing around the house. She flinched a bit.  A glint of fear passed through her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned towards my side and pointed a hand at me. &#34;Last month I would have been scared. I would have done as you said because I felt you are a man you had what it took to be an Alpha but after the night when you tried to rape me. I now see you as a weakling and not my Alpha!&#34; She said her voice was cold as steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something warm moved within my body. How did one night destroy her respect for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made to walk away but I drew her back. &#34;Your godforsaken mate killed my mothers and even sent threats to me. You would go with him and kill his sister too. An eye for an eye. I am sending you as your husband and Alpha&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light chuckle left her mouth, and the door opened revealing Luca. He walked in, his jaw tightened seeing me with Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never!&#34; She said and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked towards the door and stopped &#34;And lest I forget. I would be asking for a divorce&#34; she said</p>
