                <p>&#34;A wolfless outcast branded as Alpha Dean’s mate. A vengeful hybrid hungry for his throne. When their unholy alliance ignites, Lia must choose: embrace her hidden power to protect her son, or watch her world burn. Destiny collides with vengeance in a battle where love is the deadliest curse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being a single mother has never been a simple job but try being a wolfless single mother. Your life would become hell, especially if you lived in Attic City where the majority were werewolves and little witches who risk their lives every day to be amid wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately for me, I was neither a wolf nor a witch, or maybe I had a wolf but it was a silent one, almost useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know how the witches found me or why they kept me but one thing I know is this: I owe the witches a favor one day and I must put on this bracket made of coral to protect myself and make them think I am human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am currently sitting on the stool staring directly at my beautiful reflection as I dry my hair. After so much rejection I have been able to get a job at a restaurant on the outskirts of Attics where I currently live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dedicate the weekdays to work and the weekends to my son. A knock interrupts my beauty section as Merlin, my son, walks inside carrying a sad face. &#34;Do you have to leave today?&#34; He asks his five-year-old voice lower than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hates it anytime I leave him, but I usually don&#39;t worry he is in safe hands. Benedicta, the oldest witch in Attic&#39;s coven, has decided to keep him under her protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing I know for sure is that witches don&#39;t go back in their words unless you harm their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile, drop the hair dryer on the table, and turn to him, &#34;Yes dear, mummy has to work,&#34; I reply, holding his tender hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shoves his free hands into his pocket, something he does whenever he is nervous. It makes me wonder if this was his father&#39;s reaction when I told him I was a virgin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am sure he would have thought it was a stupid idea for a girl to give her virginity to someone she just met but I wanted to. I felt my life had no fun, no pleasure in it and sex would be a great pleasure. He eventually took it but disappeared before I woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exactly three weeks later, I found out that I was pregnant with Merlin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I follow you?&#34; he asks. He inhales deeply as if he is trying to form his words properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s creepy in here. There is no kid to play with and you are never around. I am surrounded by old women, mama,&#34; he explained softly with a hint of pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raises his head and stares at me with his honey brown eyes and my heart drops for a bit. I know how it is staying in the coven admits witches with no one around. I had grown up that same way too, and it has been fucking lonely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore I understand his pain but I can&#39;t help it, the world outside is unsafe for us especially if they find out about his pitiful history. His grandparents were rogue, and his mother was roofless although the witches told me I had a wolf and it needed a strong event to awaken it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To me, it was unbelievable for a rogue to give birth to a full wolf. I mean it has never happened and if there is one thing I have learnt from my life, it is that good things never happen to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please&#34; he pleaded again before facing the ground again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look Merlin&#34; I begin even though I know I don&#39;t have any excuse to give &#34;Mummy has to work and you can&#39;t follow me but I promise to come more often. I will come at any chance I get and when I have enough money I will take you out of here. okay?&#34;I ask, my voice shaking. I was on the edge of breaking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise&#34; I replied and hugged him. He wraps his little arms around my neck. I break free from the arms and begin to tickle him and his young innocent laughter fills the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, I drop him down and watch him leave the room. I wear my clothes quickly. Lexie would kill me if I was late to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said you don&#39;t remember the man you slept with?&#34;Benedict asks as she leans against the door. I shake my head</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I replied. When I first got pregnant with Merlin, Benedict did not care. I was in another country where only humans lived. Werewolfs had their school within their pack&#39;s territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; she asks with a cold voice. I rolled my eyes in frustration. She had been asking me this particular question since the day Merlin turned four.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Why do you keep asking me this sort of question Bendeticta? Is there something I need to know?&#34; I ask my voice laced with concern. We had all concluded that he was human. After all, my wolf was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at me intensely for a while, her eyes narrowing into a split &#34; When Adeline beat him the other day he got angry and came to meet me to report what she did. I felt a strange feeling Lia,&#34; she said, allowing what she had just told me to sink into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has a wolf. An unusually strong one is the type that only the gene of the Alphas contains.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brow for a while confused about her explanation before it dawned on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait. You mean his father might be an alpha!?&#34; Surprise mixed with fear laced my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a light nod and walked up to me, &#34;You must keep him safe Lia. An alpha Mateless heir is an abomination in Attics. They could kill both of you, especially if he is an enemy heir,&#34; she said I swallowed hard as I let her words sink into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It can&#39;t be. I mean I was in Miami. It is a land for only humans,&#34; I said in my voice, hoarse and weak with the realization that I might be the mother to an enemy heir and that we could be killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The worst shot was that I did not even remember his face or anything. I was too drunk. The only conversation I remembered was the one I had when we were about to have sex and the scenes were blurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the earth, Lia. All creatures are allowed to live on it so be careful. The witches might not be able to save you,&#34; she said in a stern voice I nodded and watched her leave my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, are you not done!?&#34; Lexie&#39;s voice echoed around the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m coming!&#34; I shouted and brushed whatever fear engulfed me. No one was going to take my son away from me.</p>
