                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy, are you ever going to leave me?&#34; Merlin asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head as I watched him peacefully playing with his toy on the beach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always leave me even when I am scared,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart clenched at his words, but I had work. I had to work to give him a better life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mer, I will never leave you. Never!&#34; I promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged his lips as he stared at me. He turned his attention to the toy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of satisfaction watched me as I saw his expression. I looked at the peaceful beach, the heat of the sun hitting me, enhancing my olive skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the beach with peace. My eyes caught sight of a dark figure from afar. That is strange because we were in summer. Then it increased, coming closer, and as It came closer I had a clearer view of what it was. My heart sank into the depths of my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were having a tsunami. My eyes darted to my side where Merlin was, but he was not there. Dread crept into my skin as I looked for him. Then I caught him at the edge of the beach. Fetching water with his toy can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Merlin!&#34; I shouted, but it was already too late. The water was already close. My legs left the ground as I ran towards Merlin. The place was already deserted, and I noticed someone running behind my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Merlin!&#34; I shouted as the water covered where he was. A muscular arm pulled me back from entering the river.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, you can&#39;t swim,&#34; he said. I still would recognize that voice anywhere. It was Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to save him,&#34; I pleaded as I rested my head on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy!&#34; Merlin shouted. I turned to see his little hand in the middle of the water. He raised his head once more to look at me. His blue eyes screamed fear. Then the water swallowed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Merlin!&#34; I screamed, fighting hard to leave Luca&#39;s grip. Tears flowed freely as I stared at the river.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Merlin!&#34; I shouted again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone slapped my cheek a little, and I opened my eyes. The rays of the sun blinded me for a minute and I closed my eyes back. It dawned on me that it had been a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia&#34; Finn called again. I opened my eyes to meet Finn staring at me. His eyes are soft with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at his blue eyes for a moment as my mind tried to read the meaning of that dream. Fear gripped me at the prospect of Merlin dying. Lord, hope he was okay? I prayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia! Answer me&#34; Finn shouted again, his voice filled with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and sat up. &#34;It was a nightmare&#34; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heaved a sigh of relief and looked at me once more. He opened his mouth to say something, nightmare, but quickly closed it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is Merlin?&#34; He asked as I felt Huh? The color drains out of my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh,&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You kept on shouting Merlin in your sleep, and you refused to wake up. You scared me a lot,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head.&#34;I don&#39;t know who he is. He was a child in the dream&#34; I said. Gulit strangled me at the thought of denying my son. What would I do? He couldn&#39;t stay with me and the dream did not make it seem as if he was okay with Benedicta, although I know Benedicta would guide him with her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied my face for a while before he looked away. He rolled out of the bed and pecked my forehead before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately after he left, my mind raced back to Merlin. Could he be in trouble? This dream was not a good one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately picked up my phone and dialed Benedicta&#39;s number. It rang for a moment and it went into voice message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear gripped me the more. Benedicta always had her phone with her. What could have been so urgent that she left her phone? In moments like this, I wished I had given Merlin a phone. I wished I had taken him with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic rolled up with me and without wasting time I dialed Luca&#39;s number, but he did not pick up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration welled up within me. Why was everyone not picking? What was happening? Luca was meant to pick up my call. He always had his phone with him. Could it be that something bad had happened, and that was why he left his phone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up my phone again and called Lexie. A knock on the door stopped me. I did not want anyone to catch me or raise any suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Come in, Daina, I entered. She wore a worried look on her face. &#34;&#34;What is wrong?&#34; I asked, sensing her discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Luna,&#34; she said in a trembling voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I asked again, my voice lacking impatience. She was beginning to scare me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A hybrid attacked our pack yesterday. He killed many wolves at night, especially on the outskirts of the town. There is chaos as we speak. I just wanted to ask for a leave from you to check if my family is alright. They have not been picking up their calls&#34; she pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A hybrid attack? At the outskirts of the pack?&#34; I asked with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. The air within the room became too thick, and sweat gathered on my forehead. Benedicta lived on the outskirts of the town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I go? I promise to come back today&#34; she pleaded, her palms pressed together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and watched her leave. I picked up my phone to dial Lexie&#39;s number again when a message came from Luca</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meet me at the outskirts of the pack today. we need to talk lia and is very urgent. Please just come and don&#39;t reply to my message. It read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he want to tell me that was so urgent? Was it about Merlin or who?</p>
