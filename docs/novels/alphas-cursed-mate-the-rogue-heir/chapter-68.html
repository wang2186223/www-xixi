                <p>Lia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet immediately grew cold. Jenny? She was Luca&#39;s mate. I thought she was dead. How come she was alive, and,&#34; no one knew?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at Finn, who returned it with an intense smile. Was this all a game to him? A game to separate me from Luca?  Well, he was a fool if it was ever going to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jenny?&#34; Luca called in a soft pleading voice. I never thought his voice could be this soft for someone like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, soft,&#34; she answered and walked up to him, pushing me aside. I staggered, but Finn grabbed my waist, helping me gain balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s eyes softened immediately. He has never looked at me this way. His gaze roamed around her face. He raised his hands to caress her face but held it mid-way. His eyes bore fear. What would happen if she was not real? It was as if he was praying for her to be real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally touched her face, letting his finger roam around her face before he cupped her cheek. Jenny leaned into his touch and his expression softened the more. He has never been this loose around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They. They said you were dead. I.. and thought you were dead&#34; he said. His voice broke, he was almost at the point of crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am alive, &#34; Luca said. I had to hide,&#34; she said. Her voice was sensually soft. Not like mine which was high-pitched and sounded like a faulty piano when working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew her into his arms for a hug. His arms wrapped around her tightly, as if he wanted to cling to her for life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger welled up within me. I have been trying to get him to let me in and he never did, but here was Jenny who disappeared for years. He was letting her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my mouth as it threatened to flow blood. This was someone who had said nothing could come between us. Someone who deceived me into rejecting my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have been fooled once more by a man. What I previously said was the truth. He only kept me for sex and nothing more. I even had to persuade him to go on a date and he still ended up fucking me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daina,&#34; I called one maid. She rushed towards me and bowed her head before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get my bags ready. Pack all my things. I am leaving with my mate,&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, I said those words. Luca left Jenny and went to me. &#34;What do you think you are doing?&#34;, he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Going with my mate as I should have done, &#34;I said and walked past him. He immediately followed me to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, let&#39;s talk about this,&#34; he begged, as he locked the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored him as I joined Daina to arrange my clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daina, leave,&#34; he orders. She dropped her clothes and bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you step out of this place. I would make sure Dean punishes you severely. It would be my last wish for him,&#34; told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately stopped. &#34;Seriously Lia&#34;? He asked. Anger is written all over his face. It was obvious that he was not used to being opposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave now!&#34; He barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood looking at me with imploring eyes. I would not let him punish her for my decision. I nodded my head, and she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, he locked the door behind him. He walked toward my bed and threw my arranged clothes on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t leave lia. You can&#39;t leave me behind&#34; he begged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed behind, &#34;,&#34; scoffed. Oh, please. Are you not tired of pretending? Let me leave so that you can go back to your mate,&#34; I said in a pained voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look lia, is not what you are thinking. I was just seeing her after a long while. That was why I hugged her. It is you I want. It is you I love!&#34; He proclaimed. His voice filled with pleading pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. Why does everyone think I am a fool? That I am easily convinced. &#34;I saw the way you looked at her. Luca. You have never and will never look at me that way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t look at you that way! Whatever you are seeing is not real. I have never shared a bond with anyone. Yes, she is my mate, but she is not the love of my life and she would never be. Do you know I was content with having a threesome with her, but I could not even bear the thought of sharing you with anyone? When I first came. I knew you were Dean&#39;s wife, but I could not stop myself from wanting you. I decided to go against my morale and have you. I can&#39;t live without you,&#34; he pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh escaped my lips. His confession softened whatever anger was within me, but I could not. &#34;I am leaving with Finn. You will stay with Jenny for a while and when you are sure you will know where to find me but with what I just saw. I can&#39;t stay here and besides, she has come to stay. I need to go,&#34; I said. &#34;Luca, please. Let me go,&#34; I pleaded. If he said one more word, I was going to melt away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes softened with pain, and his neatly combed hair was already rough. He was still wearing the suit we used for the date. How come we were separated on our date?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked towards me and cupped my cheek. &#34;Here is what I will propose. You can stay with him but I will come for you lia. I would kill him and my mate for you. Burn the pack and reveal who I am. Consequence be damned,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;Okay,&#34; I said. He raised my head to meet his and kissed me. Claimed me, marked me. The kiss was rough with pain and desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will miss you,&#34; he said amidst the kiss, then he broke it. Leaving me for more. See you soon. He said and walked out, leaving me wanting more, carving for more.</p>
