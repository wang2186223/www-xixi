                <p>Luca pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you ask me what is more exciting than the smell of blood for a wolf, It is the fear in the eyes of the prey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same excitement rushed through me when I saw the look on Merlin and Lia&#39;s faces. To them, they have done nothing, but the mere connection they have with Dean is enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, I have promised myself that I would burn any connection that would make Dean happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After soaking in the satisfaction that came from looking at Lia&#39;s blue eyes, I made my way back to Sabrina&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hideout for the past years. I knock on the door for a while before she opens. She is dressed in her natural attire of a long flowing gown with a long coral bead necklace that touches below her breast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at me, while I returned her glare with a smile. Seriously, she needs to get used to the fact that I am not going to hide anymore. I killed a royal member, so what? One of them also killed my mate. I just decided to make it even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She steps aside for me to enter inside and bangs the door immediately at her back. Ops, it seems someone is angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you not to visit the palace yet. Do you want to get killed?&#34; She asked immediately, and I sank into her soft white couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;I did not go to the palace. I went to see my cousin&#39;s mate and his wife. Is there anything wrong with that?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed to me and gripped my chin, making me look at her with an amused smile. I think she really needs to cool off. No one is going to hurt me, be it the Alpha or his son, whose mystery I have made my personal assignments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I not tell you not to harm that child? Or his mother?&#34; She asked, her voice laced with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remove her hands from my chin. &#34;Relax Sabrina. I did not, and I thought you were a witch; don&#39;t you have the ability to see what everyone is doing?&#34; I asked and stood up, walking to the kitchen to make coffee since she had banned me from taking alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but I would rather waste my strength on something else than your mischief,&#34; she answered and walked up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, Luca, did you do anything that would make them suspect you? I have been hiding you from everyone, and just because I told you about your cousin mate, who has a child for him, you suddenly rush outside. Do you know what would happen if Dean got to you?&#34; she asks, worry laced in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoff, &#34;Nothing, Sabrina. He can&#39;t do anything. Besides it, Dean, the king of cowards,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how did it go? Did she confirm it?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she did not need to. Her blue eyes said it all.&#34; I explain, remembering how intense her eyes were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I run my hands over my hair. I need to take my mind off those fearful eyes. She is Dean&#39;s mate and needs to be punished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just told her to do as I say and everyone. Would be happy, but for now. I am going to my home, I say and stand up, but Sabrina follows me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your what?&#34; she asked with concern dripping from her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My home. I need to tell my favorite uncle that I am alive,&#34; I say and walk out before she can say anything or for any of her spells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I enter my car and drive around the pack for a while, enjoining the attention that comes from being known as a bad person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the pack members glare at me with anger while the girls blush as I wink at them. I make my way straight for the palace and enter the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some years back, I was known as a rogue, and I was worthless. The only worth attached to me was that my father was the Alpha son thereby making me a prince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the news of my abolishment, I got to find out everyone&#39;s true intention against means I have come to teach them a lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knock on my uncle&#39;s door for a while before entering. He is lying on his bed reading a book; he drifts his eyes from the book to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stares at me for a while, and for a moment my heart drops. It stops breathing. What if he still hates me? Although I knew I deserved his anger, I thought he would forgive me. So many years had passed since he punished me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; he calls out in a shaky voice. His voice was soft with affection. My heart drops a bit; he loves me. He still loves me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle,&#34; I reply, still standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moves to sit up, which I help him to. He reached for my face with trembling hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are back! Where have you been?&#34; he asked. I can clearly tell that he missed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have been-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our conversation is interrupted by Dean, his son, and the Alpha. May he reign long after my death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father! What is he doing here?&#34; He asks with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His father opens his mouth to say something but i interrupts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to see my uncle and to stay. I am back from my punishment,&#34; I say with a poker grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He curls his hands into a fist. &#34;Never! You can never live here,&#34; he commands as if he is expecting me to respect him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallow hard and walk towards him, my arms crossed against my chest. I stare at him in the eye, or rather, I stare down at him, given the fact that I am taller than him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t remember asking you for permission, Dean. I am here to stay here and don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking I miss this place. I only came here to fulfill one wish, and that is to watch you burn,&#34; I whisper into his ears and leave.</p>
