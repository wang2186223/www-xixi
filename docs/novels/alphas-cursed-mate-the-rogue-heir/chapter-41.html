                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched him take off his clothes leaving him bare naked without anything. His erection staring at me. I swallowed,  it was so hard. Just as I was imagining how I was he was going to fit into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat drawing me back from my thoughts. &#34;Get down&#34; he instructed in a deep husky voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I climbed down from my bed and stood before him. He drew me closer to himself till our bodies touched each other. He began to kiss me hungrily. His tongue walked deeper into my mouth as his hands traveled down to my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands dug into my hole. I moaned in response. Just as the sex was becoming steamier my phone ran. His kisses stopped pissing me off. Who could that be</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go and pick it,&#34; he said. I shook my head and deepened my tongue to his mouth. Gradually he reciprocated it, wrapping his arms around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone call came again and he cursed under his breath. I smiled, good he did not want to let go just like I did not want to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We.kiss. can. Kiss. ignore. it &#34;I mumbled against his lips. He shook his head and detached himself from me. &#34; It might be Lexie&#34; for Merlin,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It touched me that he still thought about my son at this moment even though his father wanted to kill him. I moved to my dressing table where I had dropped the phone. I turned it on it was Lexie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called her back in no time she picked the call up &#34;Lia.. Is..me. Please can you come to the house&#34; she asked her voice trembling with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank immediately all the joy from sex washed away. Luca walked up to me and encircled his arms around me while planting soft kisses on my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;what happened? Is he okay?&#34;I asked her. My heart sank at the thought of Merlin being sick, especially at this time when everything was still messed up. As sad as it may be I knew Merlin would never have a bond with his father. I would not even want him to be trained by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence from the other side &#34;Lexie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lorenzo is here, he has me at gunpoint&#34;, she said and burst into tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lorenzo?&#34; I asked and Luca stopped right on track. He turned me around to face him his eyebrow furrowed. &#34;What?&#34; He mounted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lexie I am-&#34; the line went off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear gripped me I stared at the phone. My feet grew cold. &#34;Is everything all right?&#34; Luca asked sensing my worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lorenzo is with Lexie&#34; I, said my voice trembling with fear. Luca&#39;s eyes widened, of course, he knew that we would be in a really bad situation if Lorenzo was with Lexie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck is wrong with this man?&#34; he shouted angrily the veins on his head throbbing threatening to pop out of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he say he wanted?&#34;  he asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head with tears-filled eyes &#34;He did not say what he wanted. But I am sure he wants me. What if he kills me, what if he hkikillse-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts immediately went to Merlin. Oh no,  if he saw Merlin he would immediately know that he was Dean&#39;s child. They looked alike a lot. He would take him away from me. That was something I could not bear. Merlin was my life, my joy my everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat clustered together, and the air became too heavy as I struggled to breathe. My heartbeat increased while my skin grew pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, hey. Breath&#34; Luca said softly encircling me in a hug as he rubbed my exposed skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little by little everything came back to normal. My breathing stabilized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are going to get dressed and go there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body still shook in fear &#34;What..what if he has Merlin? &#34; I raised my head to stare at him. &#34;What if he wants to kill him,&#34;  she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath and heaved a sigh &#34;He might not be there. He might be at Benedicta&#34; he said trying to sound as calm and collected as he could</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and began to dress up, he wore his clothes and left my room also to get dressed. He came back a few minutes later and we made our way towards the gate, both of us uncertain of what was going to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive to Lexie&#39;s house was silent. Immediately he stopped the car engine he gave me a wooden knife to stab Lorenzo if he came towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it comes to worse turn into your wolf form and run away with your child,&#34; he said his voice deep with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about you?&#34; I asked. I would not want him to get hurt because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me or rather he stared at my soul &#34;I am a hybrid, I will be fine&#34;  he said with an assuring smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded grateful that I had him with me all the time. We got out of his car and heaved a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squeezed my hand gently with a smile.  we walked towards the door and opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped immediately after I opened the door. Lorenzo sat on his couch facing the door with Lexie sitting on the ground. His knife pressed against Lexie&#39;s pale skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes immediately search around for Merlin. Thankfully he was not there.</p>
