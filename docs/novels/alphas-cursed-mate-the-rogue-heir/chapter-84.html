                <p>Dean stared at me, fear screaming from his eyes. I balled my hands into a fist, his silence was annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer. My.question! Why did you message Lia through me!&#34; I shouted, making him flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes for a moment as I tried to imagine the reason why he would send such a text message to Lia. She just arrived in her pack and I would not want her to get into any trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sabrina said my reign is at stake&#34; he answers after a long pause</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows, glaring at him &#34;And how does that have to do with Lia?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the people were having issues with his reign then it was his fault and not theirs. I knew rumours would have actually started spreading especially with the hybrid they were trying to discover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard and sat up  staring at me &#34;Look man I had to do this and trust me it is for our benefit&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped my lips. This man must think I am a fool to believe he would ever do anything to my benefit. How the hell did he think he was going to convince me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care if you are doing it for yourself or for the pack or even for me what I want to know is why you want to meet Lia after she left with her mate&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because she is still my wife. She is still the Luna of this Pack. They now see me as weak because of how I allowed Finn to take away Lia without any opposition. I had been ruling for three years before my father died. Next week makes it my fourth year and my reign is already considered unsuccessful. I have no mate, I have no Luna and I have no child. And to top this I have a hybrid that is doing all he can to ensure that I look weak. If I convince her to come back she will do it. And be my Luna and give me an heir. I need a successor. You already have Jenny&#34; he pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of his need for an heir, my mind went back to Merlin, who was still with Benedicta and did not know anything about his father. Dean would have been so happy to have him in the palace. He had always had a thing for children but that was not what drew my attention or what made my blood boil. What made my blood boil was the fact that he wanted Lia to come back and give him children. Knowing how I feel about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how do you want to convince her to bear this kid for you because we both know you hate her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heaves a deep sigh as he caresses his forehead with his fingers. &#34;I would find a way to make her come back&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audacity of this bastard! What did he take Lia for? A breeding machine? Or some toy that they used whenever they wanted to? How the fuck did Lia land in his hands?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you  had to stoop so low to send a maid to  steal from me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged and whirled his chair around &#34;Would you have helped?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger was bottled around my chest. He knew I was not going to help yet he stole the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger boiled within me at the thought of what he wanted to do. He wanted to take what was mine and yet minutes ago he was offering me lies in the name of truce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sabrina was right. The people who loved me were not here. He did not love me nor did Lorenzo love me. They just wanted to be safe with no opposition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards him and pulled him by his collar &#34;Now listen to me. Lia might be your wife but that is a title and I actually do not care about the title but she is mine. I don&#39;t give a fuck if you are her husband or not. She is mine to keep. So if you are convincing her to come back to this palace and bear children for you then be ready to kill me because I would rather drown in my blood than allow her to bed you&#34; I warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried pulling himself from me but to no avail. I finally let him go after I was sure my words had sunk deep into his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have Jenny,&#34; he muttered as I turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whirled around to face him &#34;You can have Jenny for all I care but you won&#39;t lay your hands on Lia&#34; I warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As If on the clue, my phone beeped with a message from Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have missed you too Luca. A lot. And yes I would be free tomorrow, maybe we could meet at the outskirts of the pack &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile shadowed my lips at the text. Part of me was grateful that she still thought about me even when she was with Finn. It meant that I was not alone in longing for her or finding her scent in everything. She still loves me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was against the idea of him texting her. I didn&#39;t want her to get caught and get into Finn&#39;s bad book. He was her Alpha, he could do as he pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was before, but now. I would visit her to see her face for one last time.</p>
