                <p>When we entered the palace and met the Alpha waiting for us. My heart sank deep into the depths of my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had followed us. How much information did they get?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did they find out about me and Merlin?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were they going to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did they trace Luca&#39;s car to Benedicta&#39;s house?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To confirm my fear the Alpha asked &#34;Why did the both of you visit a witch today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only met one thing. They had found out that Luca had gone to visit Benedicta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Benedicta was not old. She was a middle-aged woman. In her early fifties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they knew that she was a witch it meant that they were going to kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Luca who seemed to care less about what they said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many thoughts ran through my mind as I tried to fathom the reason why he seemed so unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he allow them to see him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh! Benedicta was the only parental figure in my life. I could not lose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately he confirmed that it was Sabrina, I heaved a sigh., I think Dean noticed my reaction because he immediately raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked too pissed. As if he was angry that I was spending time with Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes as bile riled up within me in disgust. He was just pretending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sure that he wanted me dead and out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily for us or should I say thanks to Luca we were spared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like we were spared! After Luca killed two bodyguards we were spared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow! The king held him in high regard because it was a law in our park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do not hurt your kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you killed a werewolf you were liable to death with an oak treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meaning they would slowly use the oak to stab you until. you die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After announcing my engagement, the king left. Luca whispered something to Dean and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not after he winked at me. A gesture that made my body grow warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are in front of your mate!&#34; My wolf growled within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up to see Dean glaring at me. I glared at him back. What the hell was his problem?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, he did not want me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed and walked towards my room. A lady dressed in maid clothes stood at the front of my door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled and bowed her head &#34;I am Sasha. I will be your maid till Magause gets well&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded at her. I glanced at her from her head to her toe. For some reason, I felt very uncomfortable around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. You can go&#34; I dismissed her and walked into my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid all the bed as I turned around on my bed as I waited for the evening to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca felt so unbothered about the wedding. Or maybe he was trying to feign ignorance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few hours later, Sasha knocked on my door with some makeup kits to get me ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would make you the most beautiful bride ever,&#34; she said with a smile, a forced smile. I could detect it was a fake smile from the line of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, nodded, and watched as she did it. &#34;So are you happy about today&#39;s ceremony?&#34; she asked as she applied the makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held her hands for a while. She stopped to look at me.&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I asked with a steel voice. My eyebrows lowered with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she trying to imply?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled at me. A smile I found genuinely irrigated about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just trying to start a conversion. You seemed quiet for a bride&#34; she said and continued with her makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I am happy for my wedding. I am going to be Luna after all. Besides I don&#39;t have anyone to talk to about it&#34; I retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could talk to me. I am your maid&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her a forced smile &#34;Exactly. You are my maid and not a friend. Now will you finish up&#34; I blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled at me and continued doing the makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wore the exact clothes Luca gave me. A red gown with a silver necklace and shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Luca said, Dean did not bother to send me my dress. He did not care about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked toward the hall, I realized that I was meant to have a bridesmaid to hold my flower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also needed a man, or relative to walk me down the altar. I had no one. Benedicta was a witch and Lexie was meant to stay with Merlin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squared my shoulder and walked towards the door. Luca stood at the side, in white trousers and a suit. His inner shirt tightened around him enhancing his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat and gave me his arms with a smile, I took it and made my way towards the altar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to the altar, Dean stretched forth his hands and took my hands from Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They immediately commenced their mating rights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I was crowned the Luna, however one thing was missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean was not my mate. The moon goddess has refused to rematch us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean looked worried, on the other hand, I was happy, I was free and even though I did not know who my mate was at least I was not Dean&#39;s mate and that was all that mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Luca&#39;s eyes and even though he tried to keep his face blank I saw a glint of joy in his eyes.</p>
