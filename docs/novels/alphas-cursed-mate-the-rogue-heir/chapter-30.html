                <p>Lia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consciousness slips into me slowly. I open my eyes to meet myself in a pitch-dark room. I try to move but my hands are tied to my back together with my legs. I try to move the rope but it is tightly tied. To make things worse my mouth is tied too. Therefore I can speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay on the cold tiled floor for a while. Who could have decided to kidnap me? The only enemy I had was Sasha and I made sure I let go of her a long time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open. Two huge masked men enter inside and turn on the light. The brightness of the light hit my eyes as I shut it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s awake,&#34; one of the men said.  The other white-haired one nodded. He narrowed his eyes to look at me. His eyes travelled from my legs and stopped at my laps which were exposed because of the way I was positioned. He licked his lips. His eyes finally left there and moved to the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other one hit him lightly, bringing him back from whatever previous thought going on in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white-haired one looked at me and then at him then back to me. A smile crept on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss said we should wait,&#34; he said and looked at me again &#34;But I think that we torture her. Boss might add to our pay,&#34; he said, licking his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear crept into me. My body became cold. Don&#39;t tell me that I am about to be raped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmm,&#34; I said as I tried to make them untie me. I struggled on the floor trying to loosen the rope that was around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white-haired one moved to me with an eerie smile and squatted before me. He raised his hands to my face and I drifted backwards. His hands stopped in the air &#34;I don&#39;t like stressing myself, Lia&#34; he warned saying my name with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed still, my heartbeat fastened as his warm hands caressed my cold cheek. &#34;Do you want to talk?&#34; He asked me. His eyes dropped down to my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded quickly. Maybe if I could tell them that I was the Luna they would release me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would it benefit us if we release you? Don&#39;t you know that your gender has a specialty in nagging and talking?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. His eyes bore into mine instilling fear. What if they end up killing me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved to my back and untied my mouth. I gasp in relief. He stood up and threw the bind to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please release me. I will pay you. I am Luna of Attic Pack. We have money to give you&#34; I pleaded, my voice breaking at the end as I choked on my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white-haired one gave the other one a signal. He nodded and left while the white-haired one fixed his eyes on me. He came back minutes later with a can of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat watered at the sight. I was thirsty and tired. As if he sensed my thirst he asked &#34;Do you want water?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head. He opened the can and bent before me. Fear gripped me. What if the water was poisoned? But I am thirsty and I might even die at the end. It would be a shame to die thirsty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth for him to pour in the content. He smiled, and immediately the liquid touched my mouth and I spat it out on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not water. It was vinegar and it was excessively bitter. I glared at him. &#34;What was that for?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mean how would you not be able to give someone a little amount of water? He stood up and answered me &#34;That&#39;s for thinking you would be able to buy us with your position and loyalty&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss is here&#34; the other one announced. The white-haired one nodded and brought a chair for him and placed it in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard. Waiting to see my enemy. He walked inside a few minutes later. He was wearing grey sweatpants and a white hoodie with a black face mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked familiar. The eyes, the face, the scent, even the godforsaken aura. He sat on the chair provided for him as he removed his hoodie and face mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrenaline rushed within me at the person who had kidnapped me. Blonde hair,  sleepy eyes, and dull green eyes. Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lorenzo?&#34;I asked. Anger gushed through me. What the hell? What was this for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; he replied. His voice is low and smooth. I had always taken him for a fool until this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this about?&#34; I asked my voice sharp to the edge as I glared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged at the side of his lips &#34;Believe me, it&#39;s nothing personal. I just want to convince your lover to release my best friend&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An &#39;o &#39;left my mouth. So this was meant to make Luca remove the white oak from Dean. Well, unfortunately for him Luca is not interested in me. Because he asked me to leave his room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hissed &#34;is a wasteful effort. Luca does not care about anyone but himself&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat upright. &#34;You and I know that is a lie,&#34; he said as he brought out his phone and took photos of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows &#34;What do you think you are doing?&#34; I asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sending your photo to your lover&#34; he replies to me with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We got your girl&#34; he read as he typed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is not going to make Luca remove the dagger from Dean,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I will say you pray he removes it. The more my best friend remains there. The more I will torture you&#34; he warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up and tucked his phone into his pocket and strolled towards the door. He stooped and looked at them as they bowed their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once you receive my call, start the torturing. Introduce her to the real meaning of pain&#34; he said and left.</p>
