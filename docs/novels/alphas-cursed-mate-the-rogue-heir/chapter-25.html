                <p>&#34;Go. I will find my way out&#34; she says.  the door banged again and it opened. Dean barges in with his men. I stare at him with bulging eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is she?  &#34;he asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at my back and Sabrina was gone. I heaved a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s rough hand grabs my shoulder as he turns me around &#34;Where is the lady you were talking to?&#34; He asks glaring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I square my shoulders and swallow hard &#34;I don&#39;t know. Let go of my hands!&#34; I shout at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at me for a while, his alcoholic breath fanning my face, I cringed in disgust. He let go of me at once pushing me into the air. I stagger and try to get my balance for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look for her!  &#34;he orders the guard to look for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rearrange my dress and storm out of the hall making my way towards the hall. I sit on my seat and watch as the dancers skillfully dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean barges in later with his guards &#34;You are associating with a sorcerer!&#34; He shouts as he advances towards me. Everyone turned to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes for a while using my hands to massage my forehead. I am sure I will have a headache at the end of the ceremony.</p>

                <p>&#34;Oh yes, you did. The woman was nowhere to be found and you waited for us to break into the room! You have arranged your meeting!&#34; He shouted. The crowd gasped in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew what he was trying to do. Getting the crowd to hate me just like he does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not. I did not know who she was&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course you did!&#34; He shouts</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoff and stand up &#34;How am I supposed to arrange a meeting with a sorcerer when you had me locked up all this while?&#34; His jaw tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t bring this into this issue&#34;  he growls at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded back &#34;Oh yes, I will. Since you think everyone is trying to be as evil as you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not evil. You know witches are not  allowed here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Locking someone up,  beating a woman up, pouring pepper on her and almost killing her is called what? You did this to me and I did not say anything yet you stand here trying to educate me about what is right or wrong! You are all covered up with evil. You don&#39;t know good!&#34;I shouted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glares at me as I take in shaky breaths. Lorenzo clears his throat and we face the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let the party begin!&#34; Lorenzo shouts. The crowd kept quiet for a while looking at the both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually they turn back to their usual business. I am sure the women must be murmuring among themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I square up my shoulder and sit on my throne. The other co-alphas come forward with their gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fellow Luna walked up to me with a basket of fruit and other things. &#34;They are for you,&#34; she says and puts them down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod with a smile. &#34;That&#39;s so thoughtful of you,&#34;I reply with a smile touched by her kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiles back. &#34;I must reward you back,&#34; I say. She furrowed her eyebrow to look at me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean? &#34;she asked me. I smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just wait&#34; I replied &#34;Sasha!&#34; I called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sasha rushed towards me acting all naive and submissive. I place my hands on her shoulders &#34;Take her as my gift to you. Help me watch her. She is my maid but she lied to me. I want you to keep her as a slave to do anything. Just make sure you keep her out of the royalty&#39;s bed for she is a slut!&#34;I say with the last part with much anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something shines within Luna&#39;s eyes and I am afraid that she would refuse me. Then Sasha would mock me. She smiles at me &#34;Very well then&#34; she nods with understanding</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! You can&#39;t do that!&#34; She shouts, drawing everyone&#39;s attention including her lover, Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I planned Dean excuses himself from the men he is talking to and walks towards me with a confident aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my hands in the air and shut her up &#34; I am giving out Sasha as a gift to my fellow Luna&#34; I replied with a smile well aware of everybody&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He furrowed his eyebrows at me &#34;What? Who gave you the right?&#34; He asks, looking at Sasha whose eyes are already filled with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! Don&#39;t you remember? You said I could punish her any way I want for lying against me and making you treat me badly&#34;  I replied with a low pitiful voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me as confusion masked his face. I am sure he is trying to unveil what I am planning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have put him at a crossroads. He can&#39;t say no. It would make him look bad before his people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia&#34; he calls out in a low angry voice. I smile and turn to him and hug him. I whisper against his ears &#34;Try to do anything stupid and I will tell the people what you and her have been doing and how you treated me badly&#34; he tries to free himself from my grip but I tighten myself around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not all, my oh my. I will make your people turn against you if you try to ruin my day&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He is silent for a while before he grabs my hair. &#34;I will make you pay for this&#34; he whispers back with a voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be my guest&#34; I replied and stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clears his throat &#34;Take her with you&#34; he says addressing Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sasha&#39;s eyes widened in shock. I smiled at her as I turned to hug her one last time. I whisper into her ear &#34;See you when I see you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I give a plastered bitter smile at her. The Luna nods and leaves with Sasha</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bold smile creeps on my face with pride. My eyes gaze round the hall and land on a familiar face with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn</p>
