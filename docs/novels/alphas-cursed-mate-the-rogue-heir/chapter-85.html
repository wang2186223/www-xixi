                <p>Luca POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look Luca, just let me do this. Visit her for once&#34;. Dean pleaded after a long silence. It seems as if he had already known about Lia&#39;s response. It seems as if he saw my facial expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I shouted without hesitating. I looked at him and Lorenzo. &#34;I don&#39;t want to see you with Lia today and never,&#34; I warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards the door, but Lorenzo stopped me, digging his fingers into mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we don&#39;t speak to her, you are not going to talk to her either, Luca. We are not going to let you leave Jenny alone. You have your mate and she is somebody else&#39;s mate and wife. Remember that you are a rogue, don&#39;t make me force you,&#34; he warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth as I restrained myself from doing what I was not meant to do. A chuckle escaped my lips at the thought of Lorenzo&#39;s words. You are a rogue. Don&#39;t make me force you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This bloody twat. One moment ago, he was professing his need for us to work together, and now he is calling me a rogue, telling me he would keep me under leash. What the fuck did they do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped Lorenzo&#39;s hand, squeezed it so tight that he whined from pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now let me warn you, you cunning twat. Neither you nor Dean can keep me under a leash. I will see Lia this evening. If you try to stop me, you are going to hate me, and if I should see any of you coming with me to see her, I would make your death look like an accident. I am done caring. I am done saying he is my cousin, or you were my best friend. I would kill you and feast on your blood,&#34; I warned him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw dropped at my threat, and a pleasing smile crept on my lips as I stared at his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried twisting his hands around my grip, but it caused him more pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open, revealing Jenny. I focused my attention on Lorenzo. Let me show him who was the boss here. I am a fucking hybrid. Their reign would be easier than they thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, I was looking for you,&#34; she said as she used her long nails to trail my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my grip on Lorenzo one last time before letting him go. A groan escaped him immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jenny,&#34; I called without looking back. She stopped. &#34;Yes, my love&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my tongue from rebuking her. I turned around to face her. &#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged her lips. &#34;Well, I wanted to see you in person, but since the three of you are in one place, let me make my wishes known to you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes darted to all of us before focusing on Dean.  &#34;You look lean. It seems the Alpha title is not benefiting you,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean glared at her. &#34;Is that what you wanted to see us for?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she said and walked towards a chair and sat down with her legs crossed. &#34;I actually wanted to tell you about my wedding plans,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What! We all chorused. I stared at her in disbelief. What the fuck is wrong with the people around me? Can&#39;t I just have a day without drama?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;you heard me. I came to discuss my marriage with you. I thought Luca had already done that,&#34; she said in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ear itched with irritation at hearing her speak. I had tried to fathom the reason for my change. Once upon a time. I would have done everything to hear her speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are not getting married,&#34; I said firmly. I can&#39;t imagine myself with anyone other than Lia talking more about Jenny that I found on my cousin&#39;s bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised an eyebrow. &#34;But why? You were so bent on us getting married before. What changed?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time,&#34; I would have killed to have her as mine. I even threatened my uncle with his death if he did not get us married. The only reason I was not killed for treason was because I was his late brother&#39;s child. If it were to be someone else, I would be dead by now. And for what? For Jenny, who took joy in reminding me that I am a rogue and cheating on me. Unlike Lia, who always reminded me that I was a hybrid and even though I was pretending to be a rogue, I should not let them insult me and go scot-free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raked my hair at the thought of her! Everything seemed upside down without her! Was she feeling the same way? Or she just wanted to see me to cut off things with me, tell me I am not worth her time. Had she given up hope for our dreams?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, dreams? Dread crept into my skin at the prospect of not seeing her again or finding out that she had to move on. Although I knew that I would not blame her. Finn was an Alpha after all, and I was just an unknown hybrid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it because of Dean&#39;s wife? She went with Finn. She did not wait for you. Let&#39;s move on, let&#39;s get married so that I can become your legally married wife. We would have kids and be happy. Is her pussy that good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger boiled within me at her question. I have told her to refrain from calling her a slut or even insinuating it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I marched towards her and gripped her with her hair. &#34;How many times have I told you to stop calling her a slut?&#34; I asked, glaring directly at her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and I know that she is one. Forget her and come to me, Luca. When we get married, I will satisfy you more&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at her from the sole of her shoes to her hair. This woman standing here is my greatest punishment ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped her hand tighter. &#34;Now, let me make this clear. We would never get married.&#34; In fact, I want you gone by the end of this week. Out of my life, out of this palace. And this would be the last time you talk about Lia to me&#34; I warned and let go of her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at the both of them, daring them to say a word. When they did not say anything. I walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone beeped immediately. It was a message from Benedicta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hybrid was here,&#34; it read.</p>
