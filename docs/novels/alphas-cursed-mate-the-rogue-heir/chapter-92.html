                <p>Luca POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s face immediately grew pale with my suggestion. Her jaw dropped as she stared at me. I waited for her to say something, anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? I..I mean why? You can&#39;t take him to the palace. Jenny is there&#34; she said in a whisper, her voice laced with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes for a moment as I tried to explain Merlin&#39;s situation to her. I only told her about Merlin and the hybrid. I did not tell her how much conflict he caused and what Benedicta had told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is not safe outside the pack either. The hybrid attacked his house&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but Benedicta did a spell. If he comes again she would do a spell till he dies&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if he snaps Benedicta&#39;s neck and she dies what would happen? Merlin needs the protection of somebody. You, me, Benedicta, his dad, and Lexie. He is the price. He needs all the protection we can offer,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of anger flashed through her eyes as she glared at me.&#34; You are his Dad and Benedicta can protect him. I would only agree if you give me another option&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a glance at her face, at her long lashes and beautiful freckles. &#34;We both know that I am not his Dad. The only option left is for you to take him with you&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened &#34;Are you being serious? Finn would kill me for even keeping such a secret from him&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He would not care that much. He has a mistress, and besides, he keeps on asking about you every single day. He keeps on complaining telling me he wants to be with his mother. Are you waiting till he asks you if you are his mother before it dawns on you that you have been absent all his life? He needs a parent&#39;s warmth, and just so you know, Benedicta got weak; she is not fine, and do you know why? Because she spent all her energy doing spells for Merlin, and just for your information,, he attacked their house thrice lia, thrice, and Benedicta kept on doing spells. Today she might not be able to do it because of her health. What are you going to do? I visited him and all he could ask me was where his mother was. He needs his mother! He needs you&#34; I whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was seriously getting on my nerves. We both knew how life was without a mother and here she was trying to deprive him of his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind flashed back to the question he asked me as I fed him cereals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are all mothers like this? Bella has a mother, and her mother is always with her and cuddles her to sleep, but I have none except you. No one comes to my school activity. Benedicta is mostly busy. Why is my mum not coming? Does she hate me?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain squeezed my heart at his question. Not only because of that but because of how pained he sounded when asking the question. He seems frustrated and helpless. And I knew for sure that he must have tried to convince her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took in a deep breath, tears stood in her eyes. I closed my eyes as I grained. I have forgotten how soft Lia can be around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know it is not my fault,&#34; she said helplessly. &#34;I can&#39;t tell Dean; he does not even remember that night, and I can&#39;t tell Finn. He would not listen; he might even kill Merlin,&#34; she said weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sucked in a deep breath. I hate seeing Lia like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but we have to do something. I might spend a night in their house today to protect him but we have to do something. Do you know what he asked me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sucked in her tears &#34;What did he ask you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are all mothers like this? Bella has a mother, and her mother is always with her and cuddles her to sleep, but I have none except you. No one comes to my school activity. Benedicta is mostly busy. Why is my mum not coming? Does she hate me? That was what he said&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened as her hands trembled &#34;Are you serious? Did he ask that question&#34; she asked in a trembling voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. It was obvious that she was in pain but I had to tell her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ohh, god. He must probably hate me. My child hates me. I am a failure&#34; she said amidst tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved towards her and wiped her tears before engulfing her in a hug. &#34;I don&#39;t know what to do. I don&#39;t know what to do. I can&#39;t live with the idea of my child hating me&#34; she pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, still patting her back. Sometimes life gives us situations without solutions. I wonder how she survived during her first year till she met me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where were you when you met Dean?&#34; I asked after her sobs had subsided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At Miami. We had a party and I felt like escaping from the pack where everyone knew me as wolfless. I felt a night of music and tequila won&#39;t hurt but it ended up giving me a lifetime punishment&#34; she said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh, Merlin is not a punishment. It is only looking like one because his father does not know him. If he knew you would be treated as a queen and nothing less&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was true because he was looking for an heir. He would be amazed to find out that he had a son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would visit him tomorrow but what do we do?&#34; She asked me. She looked so pained and drained. Gosh! I would have kept his speech to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would talk to Sabrina. Maybe she can do some spell or find out why he forgot. It is okay for you not to remember, your world was locked but he is an Alpha. He cannot get drunk&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you think someone is behind this?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;That is my guess,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone pepped with a notification. Color immediately drained from her skin. &#34;Oh my god. Finn is looking for me. He has sent men to search for you. Better get going,&#34; she said with so much fear and pain.</p>
