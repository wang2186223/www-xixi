                <p>Luca pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had left my phone on recording mode and left it with Lia. I overheard all their conversation. Anger welled up at the thought of her finding it difficult to know who she belonged to. Even though I told her I would not let her mate,  even though all I had done was to protect her from my brothers and enemies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make matters worse Merlin called me his father and I can swear my heart melted at the thought of being Merlin&#39;s dad. My heart melted at the thought of owning Lia and everything she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was easy for me. Even if they had told me to choose between my mate and her I would gladly choose her. However, I felt a pang of pain when I discovered that she was not my mate because I was drawn to her rather than Jenny, my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To cool off whatever ache within me I decided to go and visit my mother&#39;s mother or Sabrina. Anybody that would help me nurse my wounded heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she had knocked on my door I had made up my mind to act like I did not care. To make her afraid of losing me just like the way I was afraid of losing her and trust me it was working until water gathered her eyes and I knew I had hurt her more than I wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just had to pacify her. Then I walked away. I was on my way to the outskirts of the pack when Sabrina texted me telling me to come to her house. It is very urgent to read the text message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on her door twice before she opened it. She was wearing a blue long-sleeve gown with her usual necklace made of coral beads. She smiled at me and stepped aside for me to come in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I breezed in with my normal pride &#34;What is it you wanted to tell me that was so urgent&#34; I asked impatiently. It irritated me that  I was still in this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled and walked towards the kitchen and returned with a cup of tea. I glared at her then at the tea &#34;On a scale of one to ten, how much poison did you put into this tea?&#34;I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled and sat down on her couch &#34;You are still useful to me so don&#39;t be afraid. By the way, where are you going?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged and sat on her chair &#34;Going to meet my grandmother&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled &#34;Awwn, is there trouble at Love Island?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes in disgust. Of course, she knew I quarreled with Lia. &#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, just want you to go back to the palace,&#34; she said with a stern voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my eyebrow. Don&#39;t tell me she called you just to tell me to go to the palace. Why did she not tell me on the phone or maybe she knew I was not going to obey her? Witches are a pain in my ass. &#34;Why should I?&#34; I asked her with nonchalance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled as she sipped her tea making a throaty noise &#34;You haven&#39;t drunk your tea&#34; she said gesturing at the filled cup that I had laid on her table. &#34;Are you still afraid that I am going to poison you?&#39;&#39; she added, her voice laced with teasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my lips together stopping myself from spilling whatever I had in mind. I looked at my wristwatch, impatience was rumbling within me. I took the tea and sipped a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sabrina,&#34; I called sternly. She raised her eyebrow in feigned ignorance. I rolled my eyes in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lovers do quarrel. It does not mean you would treat her like trash and leave. Your brother is holding a party for her and I promise you that if you don&#39;t get there early. You are going to blame yourself for whatever happened, &#34;she warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First we are not lovers and if you are talking about lia. Dean is her husband he can do whatever he wants with her&#34; I replied nonchalantly even though it felt forbidden to call Dean her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I cared so much for whatever he did to her but I was not a toy or a bodyguard to her. I needed her to value my presence to appreciate it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled at me &#34;We both know that is a lie.&#34; She said I hated the fact that she was telling the truth. &#34;Well, if you don&#39;t Lia might end up getting raped by your cousin or even get killed&#34; she added and watched my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw tightened at the thought of coming back and discovering that Lia was dead or that she was raped by Dean. My reaction would be bloody. I might as well kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at her &#34;If you happen to be lying I would kill you with my own hands&#34; I warned as I stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little chuckle escaped her lips. &#34;You can&#39;t harm me.&#34; She said and opened the door for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at her once more before I entered my car and drove away. I sped up towards the palace. I met a large crowd outside eating and drinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone created a path for me as I entered. Of course, everyone knew how brutal I could be or maybe they still saw me as the forbidden one who killed their Luna. Either way, it was their business and not mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I beckoned Ava one of Lia&#39;s maids. &#34;Where is your Luna?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She went with the Alpha to his room&#34; she informed me, fear lacing her voice, her shoulders tightened with hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you hiding? Tell me, I won&#39;t tell anyone&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was drunk. She went with the Alpha to his bed&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and left her advancing towards the Dean&#39;s room. His bodyguards stood there. I tried to knock but they stopped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Alpha is busy with his Luna,&#34; he said with triumph in his voice. I smiled, he has always been a loyal twat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brought out my knife and stabbed one, then I snapped Raphael&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help!&#34; Lia screamed. My desperation increased. The door was tightly locked. I kept on hitting the door with my full weight until it opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood filled my vision at the sight. Lia was lying on the bed with tear-stained eyes with a naked Luca. He was obviously forcing himself on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled when she saw me and at that moment all the anger I had toward her washed away. It was replaced with anger, I made up my mind that the next time he would do such a thing I would kill him. I don&#39;t care how the pack would see me.</p>
