                <p>Immediately I get to Luca&#39;s chamber, I knock on the door for a while. He opens it and steps aside for me to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widen as it scans through the room. The room is so huge and beautiful. What the hell does a man do with so much space?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes moved from his big spacious bed covered with expensive beddings to the sandstone table decorated with glass by the side. Different oil paintings hang on the wall by the side of a walk-in closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, my eyes land on Luca who is standing by the large glass window. He is shirtless, he is holding a glass of wine with his left hand and his right hand is tucked into the pocket of his grey sweat pants revealing his masculine physique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut the door&#34; he orders. His voice is cold and lacks emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shut the door behind me and stand at a far distance. A heavy awkward uncomfortable silence exists between us. Tension fills the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stay in that position for about three whole minutes. I am tempted to ask him why he called me but with how tense his shoulders are I decide to shut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he decides to break the silence &#34;Is it true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed whatever fear that gripped me. &#34;He would not hurt me&#34; I keep on chanting in my mind. He killed me,  but then again, I lied to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; I ask in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a split second the glass he is holding hits the wall. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare pretend to me or feign ignorance? Is it true?&#34; He asks as he approaches me,  both hands tucked into his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I answered. Of course, I know he is asking me about Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He halts for a while, a few steps away from me. His eyes darken in anger and so does his voice &#34;Look at me Lia&#34; he orders. Even though he is angry,  I can&#39;t help but feel the softness with which he used to call my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raise my head to look at him. I tighten my grip around my clothes as I keep on chanting in my mind &#34;he won&#39;t hurt me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I reply in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, &#34;why did you not tell me?&#34;  he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard as beads of sweat covered my forehead &#34;There was no time?&#34; I answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gives a sardonic laugh &#34;No time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod &#34;Yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I met you in the room there was no time? When we were walking to the room, no time? When I came to your fucking bedroom, there was still no time?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What am I meant to say? How do I explain it to him without him feeling angry? I didn&#39;t even know who he was when I felt the mate bond. Even when we discussed our way to our room it was an uncomfortable one. He had just informed me that he killed Dean&#39;s mother. Should I have told him at that time? Hell no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or when he came to my room? There was no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me!&#34; He shouts at the top of his voice. I flinch in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to tell you. I did not just know how to put it.&#34; I reply with a shaky voice. My eyes are already filled with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Suck in those tears. I don&#39;t want to see it roll&#34; he warns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take in a shaky breath. What have I gotten myself into?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you have him in your room the day our Alpha died?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to my room and met him. He-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damit!&#34; He curses under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fucking came to you to complain about the same situation&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me explain&#34; I plead, allowing the tears to finally flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said wipe those tears of yours!&#34; He ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I use the back of my hand to wipe them off as I start to explain &#34;I did not know about his motive. I was hiding when he saw me and our bond connected. He said he would come back for me. After our discussion, I opened my door only to see him there. He said he came to check up on me. I swear I did not know his motive&#34; I explained with a shaky voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never lie to you&#34;  I assure him even though I had lied to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffs&#34; You have lied to me lia. But let&#39;s walk on that?&#34;  he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh of relief. He strolled toward me slowly. &#34;What did you tell him&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallow hard. I can&#39;t tell him that Finn almost kissed me. He will be mad at me. So I decided to lie. I don&#39;t see the reason why the moon goddess would decide to trap me between two men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said he would come and get me. I told him okay&#34; I responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His rough hands circle my neck.  as he leans forward. His musky scent hit my nostrils. He lifts my chin, making me stare at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are my lia and no one can change that&#34; he growls into my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shivers run down my spine. He brings his face from my ear back to my face. He stares at me for a while and his eyes move to my lips as his face darkens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips land on mine, I stay mobile for a while as my brain tries to process what just happened. He keeps on kissing me as his tongue begs for access. I open my mouth, and his hot breath mixes with mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My arms willingly wrap around his neck as I deepen the kiss. A moan escapes me. He pulls from me panting as we both gasp for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I expect him to continue but he steps away. I furrow my eyebrow &#34;Get out.!&#34; He orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I ask with disbelief. What did I do now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I. said.get.out&#34; he shouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t just kiss me and ask me to leave. That&#39;s not how things are done.&#34; I retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He takes a deep breath as he glares at me. &#34;I said get out,&#34; he orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take in soft breaths and leave the room.</p>
