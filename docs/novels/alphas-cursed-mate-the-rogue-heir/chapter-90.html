                <p>Evening came slowly. Luca had already texted me the location of where we would meet. Now I just have to pass the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call with Lexie and confirming that Merlin was okay. Finn had left me like he did not join me for breakfast or even bade me goodbye he just left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I asked where he went they told me he had a business meeting. Everyone was at the table except him and Bianca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when I asked where Bianca was I was told she had a business meeting. I nodded with a smile. They all seemed to be having a business meeting early in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he say she was to him again? His cousin. His cousin, not his secretary or personal assistant so why did they attend meetings together?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was going on between them. He was cheating on me with her for sure. That was the only explanation he could give me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his sister tried to explain on their behalf, I shunned her. I was not a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not care about them that much. I had a son to worry about, and I still found myself wet thinking about Luca. Even the memory of his laughter caused warmth to my heart, and nowadays, I find myself thinking about him more often than I should.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tried to find his personality in someone who had blue eyes or average-height hair or someone who laughed or looked at me with such respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn does not even care about me and I have accepted that in good faith. What I have not accepted is me being an ornament like I was in Dean&#39;s marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way I got rid of Maggie would be the same way I get rid of her. I would not only be his Luna, I would be his wife and also Luca&#39;s lover. It was time to be selfish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, I spent a lot of time with Annabel. She seemed more friendly with me and even confessed how she usually feels when she offers to do something for me, and I refused, only to see Daina doing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to accept the fact that I had another maid now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately it clocked seven o&#39;clock I made my way to the outskirts of the pack without anyone following me or informing anybody. Luca had already told me he would be waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I saw him, I ran to hug him, grateful that he had come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you fine?&#34; he asked with concern. Maybe he was surprised by the way I hugged him tightly as if I was holding on to my dear life which was true. He was my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I said in a whisper. I buried my nose in his coat to take in all his intoxicating scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s muscles tightened for a while as I sniffed him in. &#34;Lia, we need to talk,&#34; he said as he let me go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. Why was he trying to be uptight around me? Has he moved on so quickly or what?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat opposite him while he bent his head avoiding my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw Merlin today and he has been asking after you. He is no longer safe with the pack as Hybrid keeps attacking us. You need to see him and talk to him,&#34; he said, but all his words sounded blurry to my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you kiss her?&#34; I asked immediately if I was done trying. I was not going to hide my jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He furrows his eyebrow &#34;What?&#34; He asked with a surprised-filled tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I licked my teeth with my tongue and tilted my head to the side before turning to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you kiss her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s eyes narrowed to a split, and he leaned backward. &#34;Who?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jenny, did you kiss her?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Where is that coming from?&#34; He asked, seeming genuinely confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged &#34;I don&#39;t know. Maybe you will tell me. I hugged you and you did not hug me back. Not even a peck on my forehead. No, I missed you. So I was wondering maybe you fucked her while I thought about you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed under his breath &#34;No. You are in your mate&#39;s pack. I would not want to complicate things the more&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That did not answer my question?&#34; I asked in a lethal tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Okay. We did not even share a room. I slept playing Lana del Rey&#39;s song because it reminded me of you. Are you happy now? Can we go back to what is at hand I would love to do what I am here for and go. I would not want you to get into Finn&#39;s trouble because I would not be here to save you, and I am afraid that if I touch you, peck your forehead, or stare at you, I would lose control and forget why I am here. That is why I did not touch you. Are you happy now? Can we proceed?&#34; He blurted out with pain in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart squeezed at his speech and his burning gaze on me. He was trying to stop himself from touching me so that Finn would not hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled sharply. &#34;I am sorry,&#34; I said, even though I did not know what I was apologizing for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be. Don&#39;t just let him touch you&#34; he ordered with so much force in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. A moment of silence passed before I spoke &#34;I plan on seeing him tomorrow morning. I would ask Finn for permission to visit. Have you found the hybrid?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head sadly &#34;No. I am thinking of taking Merlin in to protect him. Benedicta did a spell but she is human. If she died, all her spells die with her, and we would not be able to do anything to protect him. He would never get hurt with me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He would keep on asking about me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would give him an excuse. I just want him to be okay. A hybrid can&#39;t kill a hybrid&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, thankful for the fact that he still took Merlin as his son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is he treating you?&#34; He asked after a moment of silence passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;I think he has a Mistress,&#34; I said lazily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bloody twat!&#34; Luca cursed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry I am fine. However, I wanted to tell you something about Jenny&#34; I said in a serious tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spill&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jenny does not want you or Dean. She wants the throne&#34;.</p>
