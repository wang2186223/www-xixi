                <p>Luca was right. You only had one true love and that was our love story. I have been a fool to think that Finn would love me. I was his mate, and there was a mate bond, but it would never be more than that. He would satisfy me in bed because he wanted to and not because of a passion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I got to the room, tears were already flowing down my eyes. I wiped it off before it dropped. They were not worth my tears, not a single one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t even angry with the fact that he might be cheating on me with Binaca. I was angry that he left me on my first day to go and swim with his so-called cousin. What a despicable liar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in a shaky breath as I tried to calm the anger that was welling up within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brought out my phone and reread the message again and again. If he was cheating on me I was allowed to do the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed the reply button and typed, &#34;I have missed you too, Luca. A lot. And yes, I would be free tomorrow; maybe we could meet on the outskirts of the pack. &#34; I reread it again and again and pressed send.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, Finn walked into the room. He had already dried himself up. He stared at me for a while, maybe contemplating on what to say next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, we need to talk,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded using the we need to talk phrase. They used it every time they wanted to say something annoying or offer a silly excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed and tilted my head towards the wall clock on the wall making him do the same. &#34;It&#39;s nine o&#39;clock. Maybe you might not remember, but I am a royalty, and we value our sleep a lot. So I am going to take my bath and sleep while you return to your friend&#34; I retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened. &#34;You mean Bianca?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;Her name is none of my business,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes to a split, then his eyes widened. &#34;Are you jealous? She is my cousin. She just visited nothing is going on&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at him from the hollow of his shoes to his dark wet hair. Do I look that dumb or what? How on earth did he expect me to believe such a lie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my lips into an amused smile. &#34;I know,&#34; and walked towards the changing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He followed me inside. &#34;You do know that you had no right to be angry considering what you had with Luca,&#34; he blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled. That was his excuse. My affair with Luca. But at least he knew I had a history with Luca. I did not tell him that Luca was my cousin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see. So you are trying to justify whatever is going  on between you and her right?&#34; I asked, sounding amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at me for a while as he pinched the bridge of his nose. &#34;No. I am trying to tell you that I was not cheating on you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And whoever said you are cheating on me because I don&#39;t remember telling you,&#34; I retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step backward. &#34;Don&#39;t take me for a fool, okay? You did not have to say it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And don&#39;t take me for a fool either! You can&#39;t tell me nothing is going on between you and her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is my cousin!&#34; he shouted, frustration filling his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lies!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Don&#39;t call me a liar, lia! I am your Alpha&#34; he snapped</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Alpha is Dean and not you. He is the  Alpha of my pack, not you! She did not act like your cousin. You didn&#39;t introduce her to me the way you did to your sister. Instead, you left me in the presence of the staff with no explanation, and you expect me to believe that lie!&#34; I screamed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed his eyes and pressed his hands together. &#34;Look, lia. I am sorry for the way I left you. Something came up, and I had to go. Don&#39;t just build an idea about me with just one act. And don&#39;t act as if you were not thinking about Luca on our way here because I know you were, and I don&#39;t blame you, but I am asking for a fresh start. I have no affair and I never had. I have been clinging on to the day I would see my mate. Did it ever cross your mind how I would feel if you were lying? Jenny was the one who approached me and told me to take my mate, who was having an affair with her mate. You were in Luca&#39;s arms while I slept, consumed by the thought of you. still, I am ready to put all these aside and start afresh,&#34; he implored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, my heart melted at his speech. It sounded genuine. His eyes looked pure like he wanted to give me a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;Fine, I apologize for lying to you. I am sorry&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heaved a sigh of relief. &#34;Good. I will introduce the both of you tomorrow&#34; he said and pressed a kiss on my forehead before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at him and watched him close the door, but all I could think about was what he said about Jenny. How come Jenny knew he was my mate? And how did she know I was seeing Luca?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully we are going to meet tomorrow. I am going to warn him about her. She can&#39;t be trusted.</p>
