                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take in a shaky breath to ensure that I look okay before I get into the car. I would not want Finn to see me like this, but thinking about the fact that I might not see Lexie again brings in a fresh flow of tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I got into the car, I turned my face towards the other side and pulled my hair to one side, preventing Finn from seeing my face or my pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you hate me?&#34; Finn asks me, his deep velvet voice sending shivers down my spine, he seems closer than usual. Goosebumps cover my body, why is he so close he is me. when did he leave the other end of the car?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head and clean the tears.  &#34;No, I don&#39;t. You are my mate why would I hate you?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. Maybe for taking you away from your friends, in a short period. You have been crying since you got into the car. Seems like she was pretty close to you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod, unable to say anything. Of course, she is close to me. She was my best friend. &#34;She&#39;s my best friend. It means a lot to me,&#34; I reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods and I feel him return back to the end of the car. Having him close was already enough torture. The fact that he is my mate and I am drawn towards him but I can&#39;t stop myself from thinking about Luca, and. I run my hands around my kind black hair in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hate when I don&#39;t know what I want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, look at me,&#34; he commands softly. I turn around to meet his honey-brown eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t said a word since we left the place and it&#39;s kind of sickening. I am your mate. I can feel your feelings and sometimes place my hands on your thoughts. Luca has been filling your thoughts and I know it&#39;s difficult for you, but it&#39;s hurting me. You told me that you wanted more time with the people you love. You never told me you were asking for more time with your lover. While I waited, you warmed another person&#39;s bed,&#34; he complained, his voice soft with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My anger melted at once at his speech. It was true, in reality, I was his mate. He deserved some space in my heart, but I had a lot of shared memory with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make up for my misconduct I said. &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be. Just open your heart and try to give me a chance. It would be worth it,&#34; he promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged my lips as I nodded. &#34;Are you still going to see your guardian?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it is some meters away from here,&#34; thanked the moon goddess reminding me about my visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, the car stopped at Benedicta&#39;s cottage. I stepped outside, grateful that he did not offer to follow me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rang the doorbell twice, and Benedicta opened it. Her face turned into a frown as she stared at me and the convoy of cars that were at her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped aside for me to come in. The nostalgic scent of herbs hit my nostrils. My foot felt so soft on her rug. The television was on, but Merlin was not in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it true?&#34; She asked me as I took my seat. She was standing before me, her hands on her waist. A habit that she protested anytime she was angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About Finn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, about Finn, and also about Luca and Jenny. Is Jenny actually back and why&#39;d Finn take you away? I thought Luca said he would never let you go. He looked happy whenever you were around&#34; she inquired,,&#34; a hint of worry laced her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, inquired,,&#34; and he truthfully did not want me to go. Besides, you don&#39;t expect me to stay there with an unloving husband, a liver who has a mate who was his first lover, and a beta who hates me, and besides, Finn seems sincere.&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face softened gradually as she inspected me. Her eyes searched my face, looking for any sign of discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really want to go with him?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Finn is my mate. I don&#39;t think the moon goddess would punish me twice,&#34; I said and added, &#34;Where is Merlin?&#34; I asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merlin ran inside from the corridor with a car toy in his hands. He hugged me tightly as he mumbled, &#34;Mummy&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears filled my eyes. He had grown taller than last time. Tears filled his blue eyes. He broke from my embrace and took a quick glance at the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Dad?&#34; He asked. My heart sank at the mention of Dad. He was talking about Luca for sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleared my throat. &#34;He is quite busy. I came alone&#34;.  I informed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me with a frown for a while before he shrugged. alone, &#34;Okay. Come, let me show you my toy house. I made it a week ago. Benedicta helped me and Dad brought the woods for it,&#34; He said as he dragged my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed him to his room. To see the wooden house he had made with little wood. He had his cars placed around it with a doll inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is this?&#34; I asked, opening the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bella. She&#39;s my friend. Dad named her,&#34; he informed me with delight in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca never told me he visited him this often. He showed me around his wooden house for a while before Benedicta knocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s almost seven, lia. You have kept him waiting enough&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. You never come by and you are to leave so early. It has not been up to two hours,&#34; Merlin complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart broke at the thought of leaving him, but I had to. &#34;I will be back. Next week Saturday. I promise&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! If you leave, I will not talk to you again. I keep on asking about you and you never visit!&#34; He shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in in my eyes. I felt like a failure right now. I should be with my son and give him motherly love, yet I was running away with a mate who did not know about his existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes softened at my tears. &#34;Don&#39;t cry, mom.&#34; He said and cleaned my tears with his thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bye,&#34; he said lowly and returned to his house. He did not even bother to give me a hug. He was used to letting me go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bye, I love you,&#34; I said and hugged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I washed my face in the washroom to make sure I looked okay and then left the house after hugging Benedicta. I would find a way to come and see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entered the car to meet Finn, still on his laptop. He just glanced at me and returned to his laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver started driving. I watched as it passed the symbol of the Attic Pack. I had finally left my home to a place I did not know.</p>
