                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone paused to look at him. Luca let go of Lorenzo&#39;s collar. My eyes widened with fear. Oh no, I have been caught. He will ask me who the father of the child was and why he was calling me mother and for all is worth I can&#39;t deny my son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Different thoughts raised through my mind &#34;What if he is caught? What If they mistook him for Luca&#39;s child? What will Dean do if he finds out? He might take Merlin from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo advanced his quality and squatted before him. Of course, he must have seen the resemblance between him and his best friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello boy? &#34;he said. I knew he was trying to get some truth out of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; Merlin answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is your name?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merlin looked at Lexie who shook her head at him. Merli kept quiet. Lorenzo turned around to glare at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is your mother?&#34;Lorenzo asked him in a calm collected cunning voice. Merlin looked at him and raised his head to look at us, Lexie was standing beside me. He raised his hands as I closed my eyes waiting for him to point at me then I would be done for and all my secrets would be exposed. Then in a split second, the door opened and someone carried him away. No,    t someone Benedicta carried him away. I knew it from her scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh of relief as tears of joy slipped through my eyes. I quickly wiped it away before Lorenzo could see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo turned to look at me and Lexie. He glared at both of us. &#34;Who owns that child?&#34; He asked. I swallowed hard, lexie grabbed my palms and rubbed the top with her thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t know the child&#34; she replied, her face laced with boldness. Luca and I turned to her, surprised at her claim. What if they discovered she was lying? She is not even meant to be talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liar! How can a child walk in and call one of you his mother? How would I believe that? One of you is his mother!&#34; he shouted, making the both of us flinch.  fear crept up within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Lia is my best friend and she has never slept with someone. I on the other hand have no child. How am I not sure that the child belongs to you? You seem so concerned about a child that is not ours&#34; she asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s nostrils flared as he glared at her, he rushed towards her slamming her back against the nearest wall his hands wrapped around her neck&#34;That child is a carbon copy of the Alpha&#39;s family&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then..it..could be Luca&#39;s Child?&#34; She said breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my eyebrows. What game was she trying to play? It seemed as if whatever game she was playing worked because Lorenzo let go of her and faced Luca. She fell on the floor gasping for breath. I rushed towards her to raise her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he your child?&#34; He asked Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca stared at me and shook his head &#34;Unlike you and Dean I don&#39;t fuck around and impregnate people. I am sure the child is for someone around the neighborhood so ask them. Maybe they will let you know that Dean had a child. Then you can let him know that he has an heir&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A bastard can&#39;t be an heir&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca scoffed &#34;Right now, Dean has rejected his mate. I doubt if there is any other person who will be his mate so he better take the child as his son or I will take the throne&#34;  he warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo turned to look at us &#34; I will tell the Alpha about what I just saw  &#34;he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he just saw. What did he mean by what he just saw? &#34;About the magic that happened just now and he will have you both punished for it&#34; he warned and added &#34;The only way you would be free is if you tell me who owns the child&#34; he shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one talked, we just stared at us. Seeing that we were never going to talk to him he said &#34;I will come for you all&#34; he said pointing at both of us apart from Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took his knife and left. Luca stood at the door watching him go with no one by his side. Immediately Luca confirmed that he had gone, he locked the door and heaved a sigh of relief. He turned to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Merlin is no longer safe here. I will go and tell Benedicta about the attack while you deal with Lexie&#34; he said and turned to Lexie &#34;Thank you&#34; he said. Lexie nodded in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart warmed with the thought of Luca thanking Lexie for Merlin&#39;s sake. Something only a father would do. Gosh! now I wish I had slept with Luca and not Dean</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you go tomorrow? I will go with you. Lorenzo might come back to attack us&#34; I said with a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s eyes softened as he stared at me. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about Lorenzo. He is cunning but not a coward; he only attacks when it is needed and if it is not he will stay away&#34; he explained with a smooth assuring voice and a comforting smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked up to me and pecked me on my forehead. &#34;I am going to be back in no time,&#34; he said and walked away locking the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as he drove away before turning to Lexie who had a questioning look on her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell me you have fallen in love with him?&#34; she asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a deep sigh &#34;We need to talk&#34;</p>
