                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh! Let it not be that something had happened to Merlin, maybe that was why he was asking to see me. Tears stung my eyes as I tried Benedicta&#39;s number but no answer. I raked my hands through my hair, should I ask Daina to deliver a message to me? Would she be able to deliver it? What if Jenny saw her and got inquisitive about them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up from the bed and entered our closet. I opened my luggage quickly, took out Merlin&#39;s photo, and caressed it a little. I  knew he missed me a lot. I have failed in every aspect of my life, as a daughter to Benedicta, as a mother to Merlin, as a lover to Luca, and as a Luna to my pack. I have not been able to stand for them when they needed someone to stand for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Finn opened the door and I immediately hid the photo. I wonder how he would feel if I should tell him that I had a son for Dean. Hell! I wonder how he would react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia&#34; he called, seeing that I was not in the bedroom. I cleaned my tears and faced the mirror. I had to be strong, for Merlin&#39;s life. Sometimes I wished I was mated to an ordinary wolf and not Dean. Then I would have never fallen in love with Luca and Finn would have never been able to meet me. An Alpha of his nature hardly met with outsiders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m coming!&#34; I shouted as I rearranged my skirt removing all traces of sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I entered the room he rushed to me and cupped my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; He asked. His eyes filled with genuine concern and worry that softened my heart and made me want to talk. Made me want to share my burden with him then I remembered Bianca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. I can&#39;t trust him besides I have just spent a day. I don&#39;t know how he would feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am fine. Why are you asking? You look worried&#34; I said feigning innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raked his hair on his hair as he cursed under his breath &#34;A hybrid attacked your pack and killed a lot of people&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? A hybrid? When did a hybrid enter our pack? I thought they had destroyed all of them?&#34; I asked, looking surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he knew that I know a hybrid. That I was in love with a hybrid and that I cheated on him with not just Luca the rogue but Luca the hybrid. He would never look at me the same again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I patted my cheek &#34;Oh, my Goddess. Could something have happened to Benedicta? She had not been picking up my calls&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced around the room with Finn hopelessly looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia I could take you to see her If that is what you want&#34; he proposed with a soft voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I halted to look at him. Was he playing some trick with me? He was the one who said I should leave everything about my pack so what was he trying to say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You told me to forget about my pack, then why are you offering to take me there&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at me from the sole of my shoes to my hair. He sucked in a deep breath and looked away with pain in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me, Finn!&#34; I shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know! Okay! I don&#39;t know why I am offering to take you to your pack. But Benedicta is your guardian. You visited a girl&#39;s house who you said was your best friend. I just want you to check if they are okay and then you can come back. Just see them lia but..&#34; He paused as I tried to decide if he was genuine or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t see Luca,lia. You are now my mate and I don&#39;t want you seeing your ex-lover or your ex-husband. You look worried that is why I am letting you go&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt welled up within me. How would he feel if he knew I texted Luca and told him that I wanted to see him? That I missed him. And I was still going to see Luca today. It was either he came to me or I went to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to win his trust and I know very well that going there means I get to see Luca again. He might even be with Merlin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to look at him &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Benedicta will call me and if she does not I will visit my pack tomorrow&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you look worried. Are you sure you don&#39;t want to see them?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed &#34;Luca never let me go willingly. In fact, if you did not bring back Jenny we would not be here. And if I am being truthful I don&#39;t think he would let me go if he knew I entered his pack&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His muscles tightened at the mention of Luca. So he was jealous? Finn was jealous. How would his lover or cousin react if she found out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can take you with me. He would not be able to hurt you&#34; He offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I shook my head. If I visited Merlin with him, he would discover my secret and besides, Merlin would keep on asking about his father and I would not want to raise any suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I will be fine&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then my phone rang and I rushed to pick it up. Lexi&#39;s name appeared as the caller ID.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up the phone and pressed it against my ear while Finn fixed his gaze on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, a hybrid, attacked our pack,&#34; she said with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a bad night for the whole pack&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. Finn just told me but are you okay? Is Benedicta and Mer okay?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heartbeat fastened with her silence &#34;Yes. It attacked their house but they survived. I went there first thing this morning&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh of relief. &#34;Thanks to the moon goddess. I was so worried&#34; I said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. Are you coming to visit him? He has been asking after you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, maybe this evening&#34; I informed her.</p>
