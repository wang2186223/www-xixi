                <p>Dean&#39;s pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Lorenzo threw his glass at the wall. The glass scattered on the floor. He turned to me, his nostrils flared with anger, his eyes were red and his veins throbbed out of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you always have to scatter everything?&#34; He shouted at me. I rolled my eyes, it wasn&#39;t my fault that Lia was that attractive. My plan had been normal just to woo her into confiding in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was a long risky process,  plus I wasn&#39;t even sure she would ever trust me because I almost killed her and caused her much pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I went to see her yesterday afternoon she kept comparing me with Luca. He is better in bed, he is this, he is that, Aggh! It was getting into my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make matters worse she was staring at me with those pink-filled lips and all I could imagine was her perfect full lips around my cock. Taking my whole length in and licking the cum of me and I knew this was not possible so I tried another way. I wonder why Lorenzo was angry, I mean he also forced himself into his mate&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged &#34;I don&#39;t see why you are angry. I was just trying to have sex with my wife&#34; I replied, playing with the black pen in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were currently in my office. After that wanker called Luca left with Lia I locked my door. I knew Lorenzo would be next and I did not have time for his lecture. I had bruises all over my face. I did not need his old-school lecture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were trying to rape her Dean!&#34; He shouted, slamming his hands on my table. &#34;You fucking spiked her drink. How did you want her to feel tomorrow? I made myself clear to win her over not make her hate you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head and gulped down my drink &#34;She kept on comparing me with Luca even if she had not had sex with me. I just wanted her to have a taste of me to see if he will still have her within his grasp&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you gone mad?&#34; He asked, his voice laced with utter disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head and stood up walking towards him &#34;Nah, I am just tired of trying to win her over. If Luca had not interrupted us I would have been able to fuck some sense into her&#34; I said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at me intensively, he curled his hands into a fist and drove it into my cheek. I staggered for a while &#34;Everything does not have to involve sex Dean&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened up even though my jaw was screaming in pain. I could confidently say I had received enough blows for this week. My face was already swollen. How would I face my people with this sort of face?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s where you are wrong, Enzo. She is wrapped around his finger because he is good in bed. She is an immature whore. If she had me she would know there is a great difference&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me with disgust. I heaved a sigh and raised my hands in submission &#34;Fine I was wrong but it was not entirely my fault. I&#39;m sorry&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at me once more &#34;That should be for Lia and not me &#34; he corrected. I nodded my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I had fucked up but I seriously wanted Lia. Even though it would make her my lifetime enemy. Wanted to see what was so special about her that made Luca act this way. He fucking killed my bodyguard to save her. Luca had never been this protective even with  Jenny, his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do?&#34; I asked with an exhausted tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo shook his head &#34;I don&#39;t know. Seriously, you got everything so fucked up. Maybe you can try striking an alliance with Sabrina&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little laughter escaped my mouth &#34;Seriously, the only alliance Sabrina wants is for the witches to live with us&#34; I pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then maybe you could just allow them&#34; I rolled my eyes. &#34;Think about it Dean, she is the only leverage they have against us. If we have her on our side we can win&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, no. The witches hate us and could kill us if we allow them. Betrayal flows in their vein&#34; I said and added &#34;Besides Luca wants my woman, not my throne&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo laughed &#34;That is the dumbest thing you have said since I knew you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew, but did he want my throne? He has never claimed my throne any day. He wanted me dead for his mate and then for Lia but never on my throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, Dean, we need the witches on your side,&#34; he said in a more serious tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;I know-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door interrupted our discussion. Lorenzo rolled his eyes to suppress his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A guard came inside with a letter. &#34;Who sent it?&#34; I asked. I was not expecting any letter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is from Finn,&#34; the guard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately he called Finn&#39;s name Lorenzo and snatched the letter from his hands. He quickly opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go,&#34; I told the guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stared at the letter and read it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you are aware of the fact that your Luna is my mate and I wish to take her as soon as possible considering the marks you have inflicted on her. For the next three days take care of her and make sure that she is alright. If you aren&#39;t prepared to make countless wolves, hybrids, and witches your enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yours sincerely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo smiled at me and said &#34;The game is about to begin&#34;</p>
