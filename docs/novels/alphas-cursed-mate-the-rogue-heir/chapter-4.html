                <p>&#34;Make sure you wear your bracket Lia, don&#39;t take it out for any reason. It&#39;s going to protect you,&#34; Benedicta&#39;s voice echoed in my head. I watched as the houses flew past me in the cab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lexie had already fallen asleep in the car. We lived on the outskirts of Attics. It would take a long while to get to the place where the mating ceremony was going to be held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was going there for just one reason; to get food for me and some sweet delicacies for my son since I no longer had a job. Thanks to Damien and his friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta did not even know I was going to the mating ceremony. If she knew, she would have held me back or maybe cast a spell that would prevent me from passing the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could still hear Tristan&#39;s tears as I told him I was not going to spend the entire weekend with him. However, after promising him that I would spend Monday and Tuesday with him, he started to smile again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cab stopped us at the front of the building and I woke Lexie up as we made our way towards the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will tell you something Lia, if Alpha Dean does not become my mate, I will take his beta,&#34; she said enthusiastically as her eyes wandered around the mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not blame her, though. It was a beautiful sight to behold, screaming for money and power. It had this historical yet modern structure. A typical old money house with wonderful architectural windows. It had a water fountain in the middle. Three beautiful peacocks roamed around on the other side. They painted it fully gray with a touch of brown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard the Beta has a mate already,&#34; I notified her as we strolled inside, clinging to each other like inseparable twins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever. There is also something called a second chance mate,&#34; she blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They only happen when his first mate dies. Which is not going to happen&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She halted, making me stop. &#34;Are you my friend?&#34; She asked, her arms folded across her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Then be on my side, support me in my fantasy,&#34; she retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. She smiled and took my arms again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What will you do if you become his mate?&#34; I asked her, trying to light up her mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Lia. I would be the happiest person in this world. Imagine me being our Luna. I would find a good job for you and make Damien pay,&#34; she said enthusiastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, touched by her thought. I wonder how lonely I would have been if not for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What will you do?&#34; she asked me. I am interrupting my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me? Nothing. I mean, we both know it is not going to happen. Why hope for something you would never get?&#34; I replied to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heaved a sigh, a sympathetic sigh. I smiled tightly as she squeezed my hands. I was already used to it...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be pitied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We entered inside and joined the other Girls waiting for him. Sooner than later, the royal member started joining us without Alpha Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to use the restroom,&#34; Lexie whispered, freeing herself from me before I could reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lexie!&#34; I whispered yell and followed the direction she went. I roamed around the place for a while, looking for the female restroom that Lexie went to use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the doors creaked open. I entered the next open room, which looked like a library. A female came outside the room, adjusting her black gown. &#34;I hope nobody saw us,&#34; she asked, her voice tinged with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, everyone is waiting outside for me to choose a mate. No one is around,&#34; Alpha Dean said, coming outside. He closed the door behind him and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in a long time, I thanked the moon goddess for making me wolfless. I imagined his reaction as if he had perceived my scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Dean could kill me for knowing his secret. From what I had heard, he was ruthless. Makes me wonder why someone would want him for a mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited for a while until everything was silent before I left. I could not risk being caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way towards the crowd, my eyes searching for Lexie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, I have been looking for you,&#34; she whispered from behind me. I almost jumped at her sudden appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You scared me Lexie and I went away looking for you,&#34; I explained as she led me to the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We would see everything from this angle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s also means you will be the last, last,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter, and keep in mind that after I leave, you will also leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34; I began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t bother giving me an excuse for you being wolfless. You will go!&#34; she yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine!&#34; I whispered in total acceptance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A comfortable silence existed between us for a while before the event started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Different girls, some from different parks, came to the event. He stood at the center rigid, emotionless, and watched as they walked around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some are trying to seduce him. The girls were gradually reducing and within a short period; it got to Lexie&#39;s turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wish me good luck,&#34; she said in a nervous whisper before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good luck,&#34; I said and turned to the comfort of my coral bracket. It was the only familiar thing that I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lexie walked around slowly. Her eyes were hopeful. Still, he did not move. She returned to me teary-eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey it&#39;s going to be alright,&#34; I said, giving her a tight squeeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay. Not like I expected it to be me,&#34; she said, a mist of silent sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now go!&#34; She ordered, resuming her stern voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeeze. I thought she was mourning her loss just now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in deep breaths, and looked at Lexie one last time. She gave me an assuring nod, and I left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With full awareness, I walked around slowly and nonchalantly, understanding that I could never be the Alpha&#39;s mate. The next Lycan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The circle was completed, and nothing happened. Smiled and turned to walk towards my seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You skipped one part&#34; his lethal voice stopped me on my track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, I escaped that part on my own. I did not want to disgust him like the others did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Alpha,&#34; I quickly apologized and touched him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body felt a weak sensation pass through me as his hands tightened around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growled, &#34;mate&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was not what caught my attention. Rather, what caught my attention was the tattoo he had on his hands. The same tattoo Tristan&#39;s father had on his hands the night we met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My memory might be blurry, but I sure as hell remembered this tattoo. My heart sank into the depths of my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, it can&#39;t be him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up and closed the space between us, adrenaline rushed within me with the idea of being close to him in front of everyone. He used his two fingers to raise my jaw making me look at his yellow eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you have a scent?&#34; He asked sniffing around me.</p>
