                <p>Lorenzo smirked &#34;Let the game begin&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows and asked, &#34;What do you mean by let the game begin?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you see that final arrival would be in our favor?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. If he meant his taking my wife would be in his favor, then I was not interested. It would be an insult to our park, and it might lead to war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can order him to reject her, although that was near impossible because he was an Alpha, plus it would be inhuman to order someone to reject his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would weaken Luca&#39;s thirst against us, and we will be in power once again,&#34; Lorenzo implied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;If you think I am going to let Lia go just like that, then you would be joking,&#34; I said without mincing words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s face turned blank. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged as I walked back to my seat. &#34;She is my wife; if she goes, the pack would be without a Luna, which is not good for the pack,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna grabbed a chair and sat on the chair &#34;Who told you that the absence of a Luna is bad for the park?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look-&#34; I began</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mother died and the park ruled just fine. No one was affected except her immediate family&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever he said was true, but I was looking at the future harm it might cause the park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca might decide to fight back and even attack the park. He was a restless rogue, and he had killed Lia. He would not bother to kill more for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the idea of lia being with Finn did not sit down with me. He had a rough way of living. I agree that all wolves are rogue but his own was worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Except you have started falling for her,&#34; Lorenzo said, his eyes narrowed to a split.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed as I rubbed my heels with my hands. How the hell did I end up with someone this stupid? How would he think I was falling for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation laced my face. &#34;Eww, why would you say such a thing? I am thinking about the park security and nothing else,&#34; I replied, admonishing his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could never fall for Lia. She was annoying, always finding a way to crawl into my skin. Either by disobeying me or by reminding me of how incompetent I was compared to Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never knew she was that into Luca until yesterday when she managed to rub all her fantasies on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wonder how Luca managed to win the hearts of girls into being faithful to him. Every girl I tried to get close to always saw me as a means to an end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To either become the Luna OE or gain favor from my father for her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind raced back to Lia&#39;s full pink lip. My groin increased in anticipation. I was going to have her before Finn took her away, even if it meant harming Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean!Dean!&#34; Lorenzo called but it sounded far off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped my hands bringing me back to reality, making me flinch a little bit. &#34;Did you hear what I said?&#34; He asked, his voice laced with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head as I sat up and faced him. &#34;Sorry, what did you say?&#34;I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes. &#34;What were you thinking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was thinking about how I was going to make Lia give in to me willingly. Was I going to tell him? No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; I said with a finality tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched me for a while before he began &#34;I was thinking about forming an alliance with Sabrina against Luca&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned in frustration. He was always seeking the help of the witches knowing fully well that they hated us. They almost killed my parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allying with Sabrina would be the dumbest idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen to me. We still have three days to rub it off on Luca&#39;s face that Finn is going to take his lover. We would instigate him into fighting with Finn. And we all know that he is a rogue. Finn will come with his armed men, and together we will kill him,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. It was a perfect idea. But then again, that was not what I wanted. If I could make Luca surrender without killing him I would happily do that. He was my cousin after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And before Jenny came into the picture, we were good friends. I knew he would retaliate if Finn took her. Maybe I would stab him for a week or more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if he does not fight with Finn? I mean Luca is a cunning person. You can&#39;t know his next move. He might want Lia, but he would take her in another way,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If he does not fight him then it would be a good course. After all, he does not want your throne.&#34; He said with a shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes fell on the letter. I took it and smiled at Lorenzo. He returned the smile knowing my next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and made my way to Lia&#39;s room. I was sure he had dropped her there. Lorenzo followed me to my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on Lia&#39;s door, but there was no response. I knocked again before moving to Luca&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger filled me at the thought of seeing them together, but then again, I was holding greater news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on the door. Luca half opened the door. He was wearing sweatpants but had a bare chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes &#34;What do you want?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged my lips. I stretched forth the letter. He glared at the letter and then at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; He asked with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A Letter from your lover&#39;s mate,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at me and then at the letter. His jaw clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the letter and banged the door against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo tapped my shoulders. &#34;Step one is done&#34;.</p>
