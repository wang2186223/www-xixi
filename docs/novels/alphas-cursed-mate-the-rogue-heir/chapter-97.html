                <p>chapter of our lives without any trust between us.&#34; I tilted my head slightly, watching him, searching for a reaction. &#34;Don&#39;t you think, at the very least, I deserve that? Some trust?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn looked at me, his expression still hard, but there was something in his eyes-hesitation, perhaps? He shifted slightly as if struggling to find the right response. I waited, feeling the quiet tension building between us. Whatever he said next would matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as he opened his mouth to reply, his phone buzzed loudly in his pocket. He glanced down, frowning as he looked at the screen. Then, without a word, he walked quickly to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finn?&#34; I called, a trace of irritation slipping into my voice. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, his hand on the door handle, looking back at me with a tense expression. &#34;The phone that was left at the gate,&#34; he said, his tone low, &#34;we&#39;ve just received a signal from it. We&#39;re going to need to figure out who it belongs to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Are you sure it&#39;s not for a random person,? I mean,, who&#39;d leave his or her phone there?&#34;  I asked, my heart racing. What if he finds out it&#39;s for Luca?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem bothered, what&#39;s wrong?&#34; He asked as I sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t just want any troubles tomorrow, it means a lot to me. That&#39;s all.&#34; With that, I walked out of his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>117</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked to my room, trying to gather my thoughts, I nearly collided with Alina in the hallway. Her expression was colder than usual, her eyes scanning me like she was searching for something hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you acting so suspicious, Lia?&#34; Alina&#39;s voice was sharp, cutting through the silence with an edge that made my skin prickle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met her gaze steadily, not willing to let her see any hint of unease. &#34;Not tonight, Alina. I&#39;m not in the mood to trade words,&#34; I replied, brushing past her with forced calm. &#34;I need to get some rest.&#34; I could feel her eyes lingering on me as I walked away, but I didn&#39;t dare look back. Let her think whatever she wanted. Right now, I have bigger issues to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, in the privacy of my room, I leaned against the door, exhaling a breath I didn&#39;t realize I&#39;d been holding. My mind raced back to the tense conversation with Finn earlier. I couldn&#39;t believe he&#39;d had me followed, but I had to keep my reaction controlled. Every second of every interaction felt like I was stepping on a minefield. Just one wrong step, and everything could blow up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another thought, I grabbed my phone and quickly dialed Luca&#39;s number. He picked up after a few rings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; I whispered urgently, trying to keep my voice steady. &#34;Finn&#39;s found a signal on the phone. They&#39;re tracking it right now. If they figure out the phone belongs to you-and that I was the last person who called-I&#39;ll be in serious trouble. This whole plan will fall apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause on the other end, and then his calm voice came through, reassuring. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Lia. I&#39;ve got it under control. I&#39;ll handle this on my end. Just keep your head down and stay calm. And keep an eye out for anything suspicious. I&#39;ll make sure they can&#39;t trace it back to me-or to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over me, but a tension still lingered. &#34;Alright, I trust you. I&#39;ll keep you updated if anything changes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung up, but the tension remained coiled in my chest, making it impossible to sit still. Pacing back and forth in my room only fueled my nerves, so I left, letting my feet guide me down the hall until I reached the CCTV room. I peeked inside and found Finn, along with a few other men, gathered around a screen. Their expressions were intense, brows furrowed in concentration as they worked to crack the phone&#39;s code.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to maintain my composure, I pushed open the door and stepped inside, drawing their attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34; I asked, aiming for a casual tone as I approached Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barely glanced at me, his attention fixed on the screen. &#34;We&#39;re trying to access the phone&#39;s contacts,&#34; he replied, his voice distracted. &#34;Whoever owns this is putting up quite a fight, but we&#39;ll get through eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, Bianca appeared in the doorway, her eyes flashing with interest. She looked at me for a brief moment, a hint of smugness in her expression, before shifting her focus back to the men at the monitor. She seemed almost too eager to see what they&#39;d uncover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca, don&#39;t you have something better to do?&#34; I said, unable to mask the bite in my tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smirked, folding her arms. &#34;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t miss this for the world. Something tells me it&#39;s going to be enlightening.&#34; Her gaze lingered on me, and I had to force myself to keep my expression neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, one of the technicians spoke up. &#34;We&#39;re getting closer, sir,&#34; he said to Finn. &#34;The firewall&#39;s tough, but I think we&#39;ve cracked the first layer. We should have access to the contact list soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down my spine as I watched Finn nod approvingly. I needed to find a way to keep them from identifying that phone. Luca was doing what he could on his end, but if these men managed to break through...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of firewall blocks a simple contact list?&#34; I asked, keeping my voice light but genuinely curious. I needed to understand how far they&#39;d get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An intentional one,&#34; Finn replied, his tone sharp, his gaze finally turning to me. &#34;Whoever owns this phone clearly has something to hide. And I intend to find out what that is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a laugh. &#34;Well, good luck with that, then. I can&#39;t imagine who&#39;d go through so much trouble for a simple phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technician looked up, smirking. &#34;People hide things in the most unexpected places.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s smirk only grew, and she leaned closer to Finn. &#34;Imagine what kind of secrets this phone holds and whose secrets.&#34; Her gaze flicked to me briefly, a subtle accusation in her eyes, like she was daring me to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to respond, to wipe that look off her face, but I held back. Drawing more attention to myself would only make things worse. Instead, I crossed my arms and shrugged. &#34;Well, I guess I&#39;ll leave you to your little detective work. Hope you find something worthwhile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned on my heel and made my way out of the CCTV room, my heart pounding in my chest. I needed to think, needed to stay one step ahead of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I watched Finn study the screen with that single-minded intensity, I couldn&#39;t help the irritation bubbling up inside me. He was so determined to protect Lia, so blinded by whatever strange loyalty he thought he owed her. But he needed to see reason, and if he wouldn&#39;t come to his senses, I&#39;d bring him there myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a steadying breath, I leaned closer to him, lowering my voice so that only he would hear. &#34;Finn,&#34; I said carefully, &#34;don&#39;t you think the owner of this phone may be a spy? Someone within our clan could be betraying us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barely glanced at me, his jaw clenched. I could see he was holding onto his calm with a thin thread, and it only pushed me to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about it,&#34; I went on, my voice almost a whisper now. &#34;Lia isn&#39;t from our clan. She&#39;s an outsider-and it&#39;s possible, Finn, very possible, that she&#39;s here to betray us.&#34; I let the words hang between us, waiting for him to process, to see the truth of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his reaction wasn&#39;t what I expected. His gaze snapped to me, his eyes icy and unyielding. &#34;Enough, Bianca. I don&#39;t want to hear this nonsense,&#34; he said sharply, his voice dripping with barely contained annoyance. &#34;I trust Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stab of anger and frustration flared in me, but I hid it behind a sweet smile. &#34;I&#39;m only saying this for your own good, Finn. You&#39;ve always trusted people too easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I trust people who earn it, Bianca,&#34; he retorted, his voice steely. &#34;And Lia has. Now, if you don&#39;t have anything useful to say, get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words stung, like a slap across the face, but I wasn&#39;t about to let him see how much they affected me. I simply offered him a tight, polite smile, masking the irritation simmering beneath my skin. &#34;As you wish, Finn. I&#39;m just looking out for you,&#34; I murmured, trying to maintain an air of calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as I left his office, the smile faded from my lips, replaced by a fierce scowl. How could he be so blind, so easily manipulated by that woman? I knew Lia was hiding something, and if Finn couldn&#39;t see it, then I would make him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out my phone, my fingers moving quickly as I dialed Lex&#39;s number. It rang once, twice, before he picked up, his voice low and gruff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to meet tomorrow, but it has to be earlier than we planned,&#34; I replied, my voice hard. &#34;This situation with Lia is getting out of hand, and I can&#39;t wait any longer. We need to get rid of her as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause on the other end, then a chuckle, low and amused. &#34;Impatient, are we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t a joke, Lex,&#34; I snapped, irritation flaring again. &#34;Lia is dangerous. She&#39;s twisting Finn around her finger, and I&#39;m not going to stand by and watch her ruin everything we&#39;ve worked for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex&#39;s tone shifted, becoming more serious. &#34;Fine. Where do you want to meet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced around the hallway to ensure no one was within earshot before replying. &#34;Let&#39;s keep it discreet. I&#39;ll text you the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; he replied, his voice a mix of amusement and determination. &#34;But Bianca, remember-taking Lia out won&#39;t be easy. Finn will notice if anything happens to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my teeth, my free hand curling into a fist. &#34;I know that, Lex. But I&#39;ll deal with Finn when the time comes. Right now, Lia is the priority. We can&#39;t let her stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; he agreed. &#34;Text me the place. And Bianca-don&#39;t do anything rash. We need to handle this smartly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; I replied, ending the call. Smart, yes-but also decisively. Lia had underestimated me, thinking she could just walk into Finn&#39;s life and take over. She had no idea what I was capable of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I put my phone away, a thrill of satisfaction surged through me. Lia wouldn&#39;t be a problem much longer, and once she was gone, Finn would finally see things clearly. I could be patient when it mattered. And when this was over, I&#39;d make sure Finn understood that I&#39;d done it all for him, for our future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sense of determination, I walked back down the hallway, my mind already spinning with possibilities. By tomorrow, this entire game Lia was playing would be over. And when she was out of the way, I&#39;d make sure she was forgotten-like the unimportant pawn she truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>118</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I closed the door behind me, I hurried across the room, grabbing my phone from the nightstand. My heart raced as I dialed Luca&#39;s number, silently urging him to pick up quickly. The line clicked, and his familiar voice sounded in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, what&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t waste any time. &#34;Luca, things are getting complicated. Right now, Finn is trying to track down the owner of that phone-the one I left at the gate. If he figures out it&#39;s yours I&#39;ll be in serious trouble. And Bianca&#39;s helping him. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll try to pin everything on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause on Luca&#39;s end before he replied, his voice calm and reassuring. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve taken care of it. They won&#39;t be able to get anything from that phone, trust me. No one will trace it back to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words brought a flicker of relief, but I still felt the weight of everything pressing down on me. &#34;Are you sure?&#34; I pressed, needing more than just his word. &#34;Because if Finn finds out&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; he interrupted, his tone firm. &#34;I promise, nothing will come of this. No one will find anything, and if they do, it won&#39;t point to you. Now listen to me.&#34; He paused as if making sure I was fully focused. &#34;We need to meet tomorrow. There are some things I need you to do, and once you follow through, everything will go as planned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, feeling the enormity of it all settle over me. But I knew there was no turning back. Not now, not after everything I&#39;d put into this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; I murmured, taking a deep breath. &#34;But Luca, I want to make one thing clear-I&#39;m not ending this marriage. I&#39;m going through with it. I&#39;ll be marrying Finn tomorrow, no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief silence, then a low chuckle from Luca. &#34;Of course. That&#39;s exactly what I want. Marrying Finn will only work to our advantage. You need to be by his side for this plan to succeed. So go ahead, get married to him. It&#39;s all part of what we need to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His approval only added fuel to the fire simmering inside me. For so long, I&#39;d played my role, staying patient, waiting for the perfect moment to turn the tables. Now, that moment was finally here. I was done being a bystander in my own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I replied, determination settling in my voice. &#34;We&#39;ll meet tomorrow, just tell me where.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A café,&#34; he answered smoothly. &#34;I&#39;ll text you the location. We&#39;ll talk, and I&#39;ll go over what you need to do. Just make sure you don&#39;t leave any loose ends behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t,&#34; I assured him. &#34;And thank you for handling this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mention it,&#34; he said, his voice softening just a fraction. &#34;Remember, Lia, we&#39;re in this together. Everything is under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went silent as he hung up, and I put my phone down, exhaling deeply. I felt an odd calm settle over me, even with the whirlwind of everything that was happening. If Luca was confident, then I had to be too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced the room, unable to stay still. My mind was spinning, thoughts tangled with emotions. Marrying Finn had never been about love or loyalty, but about taking control, about making sure I came out of this on top. It was my turn to hold the power, and I wasn&#39;t going to let anything-or anyone-take that away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few moments, the walls of the room started to feel suffocating. I needed to clear my head, to walk off the tension curling inside me. So I slipped out of my room, walking down the dim hallway until I found myself standing near the CCTV room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint sounds of voices drew me closer, and as I peered inside, I saw Finn hunched over a monitor, frustration etched across his face. He was flanked by two other men, all of them working on the phone, trying to crack whatever was left of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned casually against the doorframe, clearing my throat. Finn glanced up, his expression shifting as he saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; I asked, feigning a look of mild curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re trying to access the numbers,&#34; Finn replied, his voice strained. &#34;But it seems like the owner&#39;s blocking us somehow. There&#39;s nothing to trace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, masking the relief that surged through me. Just then, Bianca walked into the room, her face twisting into a scowl as she caught sight of me. Ignoring her, I offered Finn a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good luck with that,&#34; I said, my tone casual. &#34;Let me know if you need any help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, I turned on my heel and walked away, leaving them to their frustrated attempts. As I walked back to my room, a sense of satisfaction washed over me. Let them try all they wanted-Luca had made sure they wouldn&#39;t find anything. Tomorrow, I&#39;d marry Finn, and my plan would unfold exactly as it was meant to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was falling into place, and for the first time in a long time, I felt like I was finally in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat alone in my bedroom, the dim light from the lamp casting soft shadows around me. My thoughts circled like vultures, picking apart every detail of the situation unfolding around me. That phone was left at the gate it was suspicious enough on its own. But now, Finn was rushing into a marriage with Lia, someone who had always felt like an outsider. Something about all of this didn&#39;t sit right with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tapped my fingers against the arm of the chair, frustration bubbling up. It was impossible not to see how strange this was-this sudden marriage, Finn&#39;s stubborn trust in Lia, even with all the secrecy swirling around her. If only he could see her the way I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock at the door broke through my thoughts, and I glanced up as one of the maids stepped inside, bowing her head slightly in respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, you called for me?&#34; she asked, her voice soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I said, my gaze sharp as I looked her over. This maid was discreet, one of the more trustworthy ones, and I needed someone who would be thorough. &#34;I have some instructions for you, and I need you to follow them exactly as I say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded quickly, standing straighter, clearly sensing the gravity of the task I was about to give her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From this moment on, you&#39;re to watch Lia closely. I want to know everything she does, every room she enters, every conversation she has. And make sure you pay attention to Finn as well. I need you to keep track of their interactions and report them all to me. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid nodded again, her expression serious. &#34;Yes, ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned forward, my voice lowering. &#34;This is particularly important regarding that phone they found. I need to know the outcome of that investigation. Finn is digging around for answers, and I have a feeling that Lia knows more than she&#39;s letting on. If there&#39;s anything suspicious, I want to be the first to know. Understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid&#39;s eyes widened slightly, but she nodded with steady determination. &#34;I understand, ma&#39;am. I&#39;ll do exactly as you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I said, satisfied with her response. &#34;And remember, I want updates regularly. Anything you see, no matter how small, report it to me immediately. Don&#39;t let anything slip by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as she absorbed my words, her face serious and attentive. I needed someone loyal, someone who wouldn&#39;t be swayed by Finn&#39;s charming ways or Lia&#39;s manipulative front. This maid had been with us long enough to understand that my orders weren&#39;t up for negotiation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also,&#34; I added, &#34;be cautious. I don&#39;t want anyone noticing that you&#39;re keeping tabs on them. Discretion is crucial. If they realize you&#39;re watching, they&#39;ll change their behavior, and then we&#39;ll lose any advantage we have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded again. &#34;I understand, ma&#39;am. I&#39;ll be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a final glance, I motioned toward the door. &#34;That will be all. You can go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid gave a small bow before slipping out of the room, leaving me alone once more. I leaned back in my chair, staring off into the distance as the wheels of my mind turned. This entire situation was infuriating. Ever since Lia had come into our lives, things had been thrown off balance. Finn was behaving recklessly, blindsided by his so-called &#34;trust&#34; in her, while Lia seemed to be weaving herself deeper into his life every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, a marriage-just like that, without any consideration for the rest of us. If it were up to me, I would have put a stop to this nonsense the moment she showed her true colors. But Finn&#39;s stubbornness and arrogance were a constant roadblock. He never saw the full picture, the way I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, I wasn&#39;t about to sit idly by. This maid would be my eyes and ears, and I would be one step ahead of Lia at every turn. It wouldn&#39;t be long before her secrets unraveled. I&#39;d find out what she was hiding, and I&#39;d make sure Finn saw her for what she truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was too much at stake to let this slide. Our family&#39;s reputation, our legacy-it all mattered far more than Lia&#39;s petty ambitions. She thought she could manipulate her way to the top, but I would make sure she fell just as quickly. She was nothing but a temporary storm, a fleeting problem that would be dealt with soon enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up, crossing the room to the window, gazing out into the night. Somewhere out there, Lia was probably plotting her next move, thinking she had everything under control. But she underestimated me. No one waltzed into this family without my permission, and certainly, no one played my brother like a pawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, I&#39;d have her exactly where I wanted her. And when the time was right, I&#39;d make sure she regretted every deceitful step she took toward this family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a final look at the empty hallway, I allowed myself a small, satisfied smile. Whatever games Lia was playing, she&#39;d soon learn that I was two steps ahead. And when the truth finally came to light, I would be there to watch it all unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>119</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night pressed heavily around me as I returned to my room, my mind racing. The events of the evening still churned within me, and I knew that Finn&#39;s interest in tracking down the phone&#39;s owner wouldn&#39;t just vanish. This marriage was supposed to bring stability and security even, but it felt more like a house of cards, ready to collapse with one wrong move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced the room, waiting, hoping the tension would ease, but every second felt like the walls were closing in. Finally, I grabbed my phone and dialed Luca, pressing the receiver tight against my ear as it rang. His voice was steady and firm, instantly grounding me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong, Lia?&#34; he asked, sensing my tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Finn,&#34; I whispered, glancing over my shoulder, though I knew the door was locked. &#34;He&#39;s looking into the phone that was left at the gate. He&#39;s got people working on it right now, and Bianca is right there with him. If they uncover anything about you&#34; My voice faltered, dread seeping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s voice didn&#39;t waver. &#34;Lia, listen to me. I told you, everything is under control. I&#39;ve set up every safeguard. Even if Finn digs, he won&#39;t find anything that ties back to us. Trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shaky sigh escaped me. &#34;But if they get even the smallest hint of my connection to you, it&#39;s over. Finn isn&#39;t stupid-he&#39;ll put the pieces together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them look,&#34; he said calmly. &#34;What they&#39;ll find will lead them nowhere. Remember, I planned for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His confidence was reassuring, but I couldn&#39;t shake the gnawing feeling that something was bound to slip. &#34;We&#39;re meeting tomorrow at the café, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he confirmed. &#34;I&#39;ll go over the next steps with you then. And, Lia-whatever happens, stick to the plan. Marrying Finn works in our favor, even if it doesn&#39;t feel like it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words calmed me, even as doubt simmered beneath the surface. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We ended the call, but my mind continued to spin. I sat at the edge of my bed, running over everything in my head. Finn was too close, and if Bianca&#39;s suspicions fanned the flames, I&#39;d have even less time to secure my place here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to sit still, I wandered the halls, my footsteps soft against the cold marble floors. Passing the CCTV room, I paused. Curiosity pulled me closer. The door was slightly ajar, and I could hear murmurs from inside. Peering in, I saw Finn and two of his men, focused intently on a screen displaying the phone&#39;s data.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small spark of panic flared. If they got through even a sliver of Luca&#39;s defenses, everything would unravel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steeling myself, I walked in, masking my nerves with a calm expression. Finn glanced up, momentarily surprised but quickly regaining his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; I asked, keeping my tone light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re still working on retrieving data from the phone,&#34; he replied, his eyes flickering back to the screen. &#34;Whoever owns it has done a good job hiding their tracks, but we&#39;ll crack it eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a casual smile. &#34;And you&#39;re sure it&#39;s worth all this effort?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn looked at me, studying my face as if he could peel back my thoughts. &#34;Absolutely. I don&#39;t like loose ends, especially ones that could bring trouble to our doorstep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca suddenly walked in, her eyes flicking between Finn and me before settling on me with a cold stare. She crossed her arms, clearly eager to interject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just telling Finn,&#34; she said, her tone laced with accusation, &#34;that whoever owns this phone could be a threat to the clan. And since you&#39;re an outsider, Lia, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s wise to be a bit more cautious about what-or who-you bring around here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were pointed, like small knives. I held her gaze, refusing to let her intimidation seep through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m marrying into this family tomorrow,&#34; I said smoothly, keeping my voice even. &#34;And I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to protect Finn and everyone else here. So if you&#39;re implying something, Bianca, be direct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn cleared his throat, stepping between us before Bianca could escalate things further. &#34;That&#39;s enough,&#34; he said, casting Bianca a stern look. &#34;We don&#39;t need to turn on each other. Lia is as invested in this as anyone else here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca looked away, lips pressed into a thin line, clearly irritated by Finn&#39;s response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,&#34; she said sharply, &#34;just remember that not everyone who enters our lives has our best interests at heart.&#34; She threw one last glare my way before leaving the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she was gone, Finn turned back to me, his gaze softening. &#34;Don&#39;t pay any attention to her. She&#39;soverprotective.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, trying to play it off with a smile. &#34;It&#39;s fine. I get it. She&#39;s family, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He returned my smile, but his attention was already drifting back to the screen. &#34;I&#39;ll be up late with this, so don&#39;t wait up,&#34; he said, his voice distracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the cue and left the room, forcing myself to keep my pace steady down the hall. Inside, my heart was racing. Bianca&#39;s suspicions were only growing, and with Finn so close to the truth, I felt like I was standing on thin ice. I&#39;d made it this far, but I knew that from here on, every move would have to be perfect-or everything I&#39;d built would shatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I left the CCTV room, my mind was already plotting. Finn&#39;s blind faith in Lia was a threat-he couldn&#39;t see that his so-called fiancée was the true danger. And I was done watching him walk right into her trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way down the hallway, pulling out my phone as I walked. My contact list popped up, and I scrolled down to Lex&#39;s number. Pressing &#34;call,&#34; I waited, listening to the ring until he finally picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca,&#34; he greeted, his voice low and familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to meet,&#34; I said sharply. &#34;Tomorrow, first thing in the morning. There&#39;s something I need you to handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief silence passed, then he let out a chuckle. &#34;I take it this is about your new sister-in-law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s nothing to me,&#34; I snapped, venom creeping into my tone. &#34;But she&#39;s becoming a problem for Finn. He&#39;s too caught up in whatever spell she&#39;s woven around him. I want her gone, Lex. And fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Interesting,&#34; he mused. &#34;You think she&#39;s a spy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced around, lowering my voice as I leaned against the wall. &#34;I know she is. She doesn&#39;t belong here, and the sooner she&#39;s out of Finn&#39;s life, the better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Consider it done, Bianca,&#34; he replied smoothly. &#34;Tomorrow, I&#39;ll handle everything. Just make sure no one traces it back to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended the call, satisfaction filling me. Soon enough, Lia would be out of the picture, and I&#39;d have Finn back where he belonged: away from manipulative outsiders and devoted to the clan, where his loyalty should have always stayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>120</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone buzzed beside me, cutting through the early morning silence. Lex&#39;s name flashed on the screen, his call both expected and a bit early. I picked up, his familiar voice coming through before I could even say hello.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, it&#39;s time,&#34; he said, his tone clipped and serious. &#34;We&#39;re meeting with Bianca and Jenny today to finalize everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34; I asked, already reaching for my coat as I processed the details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a private room at the café near Benedicta&#39;s house. It&#39;ll be low-key,&#34; he said. &#34;Eleven o&#39;clock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded to myself, feeling a strange sense of calm settle over me. The plan had been in motion for a while now, each piece carefully set. This would be the final check, the last chance to cover any gaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; I replied, ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dialed Lia&#39;s number right away, knowing she&#39;d want to hear the update. The call rang twice before she picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; I began, keeping my voice low. &#34;Listen, I&#39;m meeting with Lex and Bianca later, but I want us to meet right afterward. Come over to Benedicta&#39;s house around noon. There are some things we need to discuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could sense her hesitation for a moment, but she eventually agreed, her voice steady. &#34;I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We ended the call, and I felt a fleeting pang of doubt. Finn was no fool, and Bianca was relentless. If anything went wrong, it wouldn&#39;t just be Lia in danger-it&#39;d be all of us. But there was no turning back now. The stakes were too high, and too many of us were in too deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I stepped out of the building and headed for the car park. The morning air was cool, the city just waking up, but my thoughts were already racing as I climbed into my car and started the engine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I drove, I reviewed everything once more in my head. Bianca&#39;s eagerness for this meeting, her insistence on taking Lia down-it all made sense, yet it felt like she was letting emotions cloud her judgment. And Lex was ruthless, but he needed to be in control. As long as I kept things balanced between them, this meeting would go smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, I pulled into the parking lot, the café coming into view. I glanced at my watch-still a bit early. I took a steadying breath, knowing the next hour could either seal our success or doom everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in the secluded booth at the café, my eyes drifting to the door every few seconds. Jenny sat across from me, her fingers drumming against the tabletop, her expression one of thinly veiled impatience. Lex was the last to arrive, slipping into the booth with a quick nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, you&#39;re both here,&#34; he said, taking his seat beside me. His gaze was sharp, assessing us both before getting down to business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This wedding tomorrow-it&#39;s our best shot,&#34; he said, his voice low and controlled. &#34;We&#39;ll take Lia out when everyone&#39;s attention is on the ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded, her lips curving in a smirk. &#34;You mean abduct her,&#34; she added with a glint of satisfaction in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex leaned forward, his gaze narrowing. &#34;Yes, but it has to be discreet. We can&#39;t have people asking questions, at least not until we&#39;re well out of there. Once we have her, it&#39;s game over for her and anyone trying to interfere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I folded my arms, feeling a dark satisfaction settle over me. &#34;Lia&#39;s become a problem, and Finn can&#39;t see it. He&#39;s blinded by whatever charm she&#39;s managed to weave around him. But once she&#39;s out of the picture, he&#39;ll come back to his senses. He&#39;ll see that she was never one of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex nodded, a faint smile touching his lips. &#34;That&#39;s the plan. The wedding will be chaotic enough; no one will suspect a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny leaned forward, her voice a quiet hum of excitement. &#34;I&#39;ll be handling the guests and keeping people occupied. By the time anyone realizes Lia&#39;s missing, we&#39;ll already have her stashed away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Lex, meeting his gaze. &#34;And what about Finn? He&#39;ll turn the entire place upside down once he realizes she&#39;s gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s where you come in,&#34; Lex said, fixing his eyes on me. &#34;You&#39;re family, Bianca. You&#39;ll keep him focused, keep him from spiraling out of control. We can&#39;t have him getting suspicious too soon, or this entire plan will fall apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a curt nod. &#34;I know Finn better than anyone. I&#39;ll make sure he doesn&#39;t catch on until it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silence settled over the table, each of us letting the weight of the plan sink in. I could feel the tension simmering beneath the surface, the sense that everything we&#39;d worked for was balancing on a razor&#39;s edge. But I wasn&#39;t about to let some outsider ruin everything. Not after all the years I&#39;d spent keeping Finn safe, keeping the family strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it&#39;s settled,&#34; Lex said finally, standing up. &#34;Tomorrow, during the wedding, Lia will disappear. We&#39;ll do what&#39;s necessary, and Finn will come to his senses. Agreed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny and I both nodded, our gazes meeting with a shared understanding. This was the moment we&#39;d been waiting for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Lex left the table, Jenny lingered a moment, her gaze flickering toward me. &#34;You&#39;re sure about this, Bianca? If something goes wrong&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing will go wrong,&#34; I replied sharply, cutting her off. &#34;Lia has been a thorn in our side for too long. This is our chance to set things right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded, her expression softening with a glint of approval. &#34;Then I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped away, leaving me alone at the table. I watched her go, the reality of the plan settling over me like a shroud. Tomorrow, Lia would be out of our lives, and Finn would finally understand the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He may hate me for it at first, but I&#39;d rather be hated than let him fall victim to someone as dangerous as Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>121</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked down the quiet street toward Benedicta&#39;s house, a shadow lingered at the edge of my vision, too familiar to ignore. I knew Finn had someone following me; he&#39;d been testing me for days now, trying to catch any hint that I might be hiding something. I could almost feel his eyes, watching from somewhere far behind, questioning my every move. Part of me wanted to turn around, to catch this follower in the act and confront them head-on, but I knew better. Let them watch, let them wonder. It didn&#39;t change my plans, not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached Benedicta&#39;s door and knocked lightly, my mind replaying Luca&#39;s instructions. Meet me after the wedding it had sounded easy enough, but Finn&#39;s surveillance was making everything twice as complicated. If he suspected anything more than he already did, it wouldn&#39;t just be me in trouble; Luca, too, would be caught up in his web. I took a deep breath as Benedicta opened the door, her face lighting up with a small, welcoming smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, it&#39;s good to see you,&#34; she greeted, stepping aside to let me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned her smile, grateful for a moment of calm. &#34;You too, Benedicta,&#34; I said, following her inside. The house felt warm and comforting, a rare refuge from the whirlwind of secrets I&#39;d been caught up in lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We settled into the cozy living room, where the faint scent of freshly brewed tea hung in the air. Benedicta poured a cup for each of us, and I took a moment to gather my thoughts. I needed answers and reassurance that things were still under control. The plan had felt so clear before, but now with Finn watching so closely, I couldn&#39;t shake the uneasy feeling gnawing at the back of my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benedicta,&#34; I began, keeping my voice steady, &#34;do you know why Luca called me here? Why does he want to meet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta shook her head, her expression thoughtful. &#34;He didn&#39;t give me any specifics. Just that he needed to speak with you about the plan, to make sure everything was still on track.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned, my fingers tapping against the side of my cup. &#34;Finn&#39;s been watching me closely he even had me followed on my way here. It&#39;s clear he doesn&#39;t trust me-not yet, anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta nodded, her gaze softening with understanding. &#34;Finn&#39;s a cautious man. He&#39;s always looking for the truth, even if it means doubting the people closest to him. Don&#39;t let it discourage you, Lia. He just needs time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, running a hand through my hair. &#34;It&#39;s not just about time. He&#39;s trying to figure out why I want this marriage so badly, why I&#39;m pushing for it now of all times. He&#39;s suspicious, and I can&#39;t blame him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta placed a reassuring hand on my arm. &#34;Remember, you&#39;re doing this for a reason, and Luca knows that. Whatever Finn may think, he&#39;ll come to understand in time. Luca wouldn&#39;t call you here if he didn&#39;t have a plan in mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip, my mind still racing with questions. &#34;It&#39;s just the phone,&#34; I said, my voice dropping. &#34;Finn&#39;s been fixated on finding out who left it at the gate, who the owner might be. If he finds out it&#39;s connected to Luca&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s eyes flickered with concern, but she maintained her calm. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about the phone. Luca&#39;s made it clear that he&#39;ll handle everything on his end. He wouldn&#39;t let anything happen that would jeopardize the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, trying to take comfort in her words, though a part of me still felt unsettled. Every time I thought we were one step ahead, Finn seemed to close the gap, always just a breath away from uncovering everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta offered a small, encouraging smile. &#34;Remember, Lia, we&#39;ve come this far. You&#39;re stronger than you realize, and you&#39;ve managed to keep Finn in the dark up to this point. Just hold on a little longer. Luca has everything under control, and soon, Finn&#39;s suspicions will be the least of your worries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, grateful for her support. &#34;You&#39;re right. I just need to focus and stay one step ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta patted my hand, her gaze filled with warmth and determination. &#34;Exactly. And whatever happens, just remember that you have people who believe in you. Luca, me we&#39;re with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of calm washed over me as I took her words to heart. Despite the tension, despite Finn&#39;s doubts and the ever-present shadow following me, I felt a renewed sense of purpose. This wasn&#39;t just about me anymore; it was about everyone who&#39;d placed their trust in me and who believed that I could pull this off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat in comfortable silence for a moment, each lost in our own thoughts. I could feel the weight of what lay ahead, the delicate dance of deception and trust, the high stakes that seemed to grow with every passing day. But for now, I had what I needed-a plan, a purpose, and, most importantly, a small glimmer of hope that, somehow, everything would work out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stood to leave, Benedicta gave me a firm nod. &#34;Stay strong, Lia. Tomorrow is the start of something new, and you&#39;ll be ready for whatever comes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, grateful beyond words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arrived at the dimly lit warehouse, the kind of place where shadows felt at home, merging with the darkness and keeping secrets. Lex was already waiting, leaning casually against a pillar with an air of confidence. He straightened up as I approached, his expression serious and his gaze unflinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; he greeted with a curt nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lex,&#34; I replied, mirroring his tone. There wasn&#39;t time for pleasantries; we both knew this meeting was about something far more pressing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cut right to the chase. &#34;Jenny and Bianca are planning to act soon. They want Lia out of the picture, and they&#39;re not wasting any time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of irritation sparked inside me. I had expected something from Bianca eventually, but not so soon, and certainly not with Jenny involved. &#34;What exactly is their plan?&#34; I asked, my tone sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex sighed, glancing away for a moment. &#34;They want to use the wedding as an opportunity to remove Lia. Bianca has this idea to abduct her right after the ceremony, make it look like she disappeared on her own, or like she&#39;s involved in something shady. It&#39;s all about planting doubts and breaking Finn&#39;s trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists, feeling the weight of the situation pressing down on me. If Bianca got her way, everything I&#39;d carefully set in motion would come crashing down. Lia was integral to my plan; she needed to be right there by Finn&#39;s side, gaining his trust, not vanishing and leaving questions in her wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not going to happen,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;You need to make sure they don&#39;t act on any of these plans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex arched a brow, his curiosity piqued. &#34;And how exactly do you want me to handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, choosing my words carefully. &#34;For now, keep them in check. Let Bianca and Jenny believe they still have the upper hand. I need you to hold off on any actions until I give you a clear signal. If they feel like they&#39;re being watched too closely, they might get suspicious or change tactics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex seemed to consider this, crossing his arms as he looked at me. &#34;So you want me to keep them on a leash, but not stop them completely?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; I replied. &#34;Let them think everything is going as planned. They&#39;ll be less likely to make impulsive moves if they think they&#39;re still in control. But at the same time, be ready to intervene the moment I say so. Nothing happens unless I give the order.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex gave a slow nod, understanding dawning in his expression. &#34;You know, they&#39;re not going to take it well if they realize I&#39;m in your pocket.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked, a hint of satisfaction slipping through. &#34;That&#39;s a risk I&#39;m willing to take. You&#39;re in a unique position, Lex. You know both sides, and that gives us an advantage. Use it wisely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to weigh my words before finally nodding again. &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll play along and keep them on a leash. But, Luca this is dangerous. One wrong move and this could blow up in our faces.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met his gaze, holding it with a calm assurance. &#34;I know the stakes, Lex. But that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing this carefully. We&#39;ve come too far to let Bianca ruin it all with her petty schemes. Lia has a role to play, and as long as she&#39;s in position, things will go as planned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lex looked at me, his expression a mix of respect and wariness. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll hold them off for now. Just make sure you know what you&#39;re doing. Bianca&#39;s not one to cross lightly, and she&#39;s got her sights set on Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle Bianca if it comes to that,&#34; I assured him. &#34;Just remember-wait for my signal. Nothing moves without it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Lex nodded one last time and walked off, his silhouette quickly blending into the shadows. As I watched him disappear, I felt a grim satisfaction settle over me. Bianca might think she&#39;s smart, but she didn&#39;t know how many steps ahead I already was. As long as everything went according to plan, this game was mine to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>122</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in Benedicta&#39;s cozy living room, the warmth of her home calming the unease simmering in my chest. I tried to focus on the conversation, but my mind kept wandering back to the events of the past few days. I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that someone was watching me, that every move I made was under a microscope. Finn had to be behind it, of course. He was testing me, trying to see if my intentions were genuine. But did he realize how close he was to the truth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta noticed my distracted expression and placed a comforting hand on my shoulder. &#34;Lia, don&#39;t let it get to you,&#34; she said gently. &#34;You&#39;re doing everything you can. Remember, this isn&#39;t just for you-it&#39;s for everyone relying on you. Don&#39;t let Bianca or anyone else intimidate you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, grateful for her support. Before I could respond, the sound of the front door opening pulled both our gazes toward the entryway. Luca walked in, his face set in a calm, unreadable mask. As he entered the room, I felt a mix of relief and apprehension. I needed answers, but I wasn&#39;t sure I was ready for what he might say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; I greeted, standing up. &#34;Why did you ask me to come here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered a small, reassuring smile before he glanced briefly at Benedicta. &#34;I think it&#39;s time we talked about everything,&#34; he said, his tone steady. He gestured for me to sit back down, and as I did, he took a seat across from me, leaning forward with a serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; he began, &#34;things are happening behind the scenes that you need to be aware of, but you have to act like you know nothing. Bianca and Jenny have been planning something ever since they learned about your engagement to Finn. They think you&#39;re in their way, and they&#39;re not afraid to play dirty to get you out of the picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of his words sank in, and I felt a chill run down my spine. I knew Bianca had her issues with me, but this was more than I&#39;d expected. &#34;What are they planning?&#34; I asked, barely managing to keep my voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca glanced around as if making sure we were alone. &#34;They&#39;re planning to use your wedding as an opportunity. They want to take you away and and create enough chaos to break any trust Finn might have in you. If they can make him doubt you, it&#39;ll be easier for them to get rid of you for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart pounded as his words settled in. &#34;So, they want to ruin everything by making me look like a traitor,&#34; I murmured, piecing it together. &#34;If Finn thinks I&#39;m hiding something or working against him, it&#39;ll be all over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca nodded. &#34;That&#39;s exactly their goal. But here&#39;s the thing: they&#39;re working with Lex, who&#39;s giving me updates on their plans. He&#39;s on our side for now, but you&#39;ll need to tread carefully. They can&#39;t know you&#39;re aware of any of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, trying to steady my thoughts. &#34;So what do I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You keep going as if everything is normal,&#34; Luca replied, his voice firm. &#34;Don&#39;t act differently around Finn, Bianca, or anyone else. Make them believe that you&#39;re oblivious. And be careful with Finn. He&#39;s already suspicious, watching your every move. The slightest slip-up could give them exactly what they want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, I know he&#39;s watching,&#34; I muttered. &#34;He&#39;s had someone following me since we got engaged. It&#39;s like he&#39;s waiting for me to prove him right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca leaned closer, his expression more intense. &#34;That&#39;s why you can&#39;t give him any reason to doubt you. Stick to the plan, and when you&#39;re with Finn, make it clear that you&#39;re serious about this marriage. The more he believes in your loyalty, the harder it&#39;ll be for Bianca and Jenny to undermine you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Benedicta, who gave me a reassuring nod. &#34;He&#39;s right, Lia,&#34; she said gently. &#34;Stay calm, keep your composure, and don&#39;t let them see any fear or hesitation. Remember, you&#39;re not alone in this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked back at Luca, feeling a new resolve settling over me. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll act like I don&#39;t know a thing. But I need to be ready if they decide to make a move sooner than we expect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca nodded approvingly. &#34;Good. And remember, Lex will be keeping an eye on Bianca and Jenny. If anything changes, I&#39;ll get the information to you as soon as possible. Just stay cautious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; I looked down for a moment, gathering my thoughts, before looking back at him. &#34;One more thing, Luca. Why are you helping me with all of this? What do you get out of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of a smile played on his lips. &#34;Let&#39;s just say I have my own reasons for wanting to see this play out in your favor. There are people in this world who think they can control everything. Bianca is one of them, but she&#39;s about to learn that she&#39;s not as untouchable as she thinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his words hung in the air, I felt a surge of confidence. Maybe I wasn&#39;t as isolated as I&#39;d thought. With allies like Luca and Benedicta, I stood a chance of navigating this maze of deceit and coming out unscathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up, giving him a firm nod. &#34;Thank you, Luca. I&#39;ll be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, I left Benedicta&#39;s house, feeling the weight of his words settle into determination. If Bianca and Jenny thought they could ruin everything, they were in for a surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny leaned back in her chair, a smug grin spreading across her face as Bianca paced the small room. They had been going over every detail of their plan for days, and the sense of satisfaction bubbling inside her was hard to contain. &#34;So, once Finn suspects Lia, it&#39;s only a matter of time before he starts questioning her motives,&#34; she murmured, pleased with how everything was coming together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca paused and looked at Jenny with a gleam in her eye. &#34;Exactly. Finn&#39;s always been cautious, and with enough nudging, he&#39;ll see her for the threat she is. And once he doubts her, he&#39;ll throw her out himself. We won&#39;t have to lift a finger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two shared a triumphant smile, imagining the chaos they would unleash. Just then, the door swung open, and Alina strode in with a look of cold determination. The air shifted as her sharp gaze fixed on Bianca, clearly unimpressed with their plotting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should stay away from Finn, Bianca,&#34; Alina said, her tone icy. &#34;Or else you might just vanish. And trust me, no one will care enough to look for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s eyes narrowed, the initial shock quickly turning to irritation. &#34;This doesn&#39;t concern you, Alina,&#34; she sneered, trying to mask her discomfort. &#34;Why don&#39;t you just stay out of it? You have no idea what&#39;s really going on here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina took a step closer, crossing her arms as a smirk spread across her face. &#34;Oh, I know exactly what&#39;s going on,&#34; she said, her voice low but firm. &#34;You&#39;re scheming against Finn, using Jenny here to carry out your pathetic little plot. You think you can manipulate him, make him doubt Lia, and get rid of her in one sweep. It&#39;s transparent and weak, Bianca.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny bristled, feeling the sting of Alina&#39;s words but unwilling to back down. She exchanged a quick glance with Bianca, unsure of how they would handle Alina&#39;s unexpected intrusion. Bianca, however, met Alina&#39;s stare with defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; Bianca hissed, her voice trembling slightly. &#34;This isn&#39;t your concern. Go run along and play the loyal little sister elsewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina laughed softly, shaking her head as if Bianca&#39;s words were nothing more than a minor irritation. &#34;You think you&#39;re untouchable, Bianca, but you&#39;re just another pawn in this game, whether you realize it or not. And don&#39;t think I haven&#39;t heard about your so-called plan. It&#39;s laughable that you think it will actually work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smugness drained from Bianca&#39;s face, replaced by a flicker of uncertainty. Alina&#39;s confidence, the way she seemed to know every detail of their scheme, unnerved her. Before Bianca could respond, Alina turned on her heel and strode toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing in the doorway, Alina cast one last glance over her shoulder. &#34;Good luck with your little scheme,&#34; she said with a mocking smile. &#34;Let&#39;s see if it really comes to pass, or if you two just end up embarrassing yourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she walked out, leaving Jenny and Bianca in stunned silence. For a moment, neither of them moved, the tension in the room thickening as they processed Alina&#39;s words. Jenny felt a chill run down her spine, the doubt creeping in despite her best efforts to brush it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think she&#39;ll try to stop us?&#34; Jenny asked quietly, unable to mask the worry in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca clenched her fists, jaw tightening. &#34;Let her try. She&#39;s bluffing, Jenny. Alina doesn&#39;t have the power to stop us, not if we stick to the plan. We just need to be careful, keep everything under wraps, and make sure we control what Finn sees. Alina&#39;s just trying to scare us off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded, though Alina&#39;s warning lingered in her mind, gnawing at her confidence. She wanted to believe Bianca, to trust that Alina&#39;s words were nothing more than an empty threat. But as they returned to their planning, a small part of her couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Alina might be more dangerous than they had realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>123</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s mind was racing, and she could still feel the lingering impact of Alina&#39;s words, each one like a barb poking at her confidence. For the first time, doubt slipped through the cracks in her carefully constructed plan. She glanced at Jenny, who looked just as shaken, her eyes darting toward the door as if expecting Alina to burst back in at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think she&#39;s onto us?&#34; Jenny whispered, breaking the tense silence. Her voice was laced with fear and confusion. &#34;Did she follow us, Bianca? How did she find out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca swallowed, her thoughts scrambled. Alina had been so sure of herself, so calm. And the way she&#39;d warned Bianca It wasn&#39;t an empty threat. She could tell Alina knew something, but how much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; Bianca muttered, her voice shaking slightly. She tried to mask it, but Jenny wasn&#39;t fooled. &#34;But if Alina&#39;s onto us, it means she could have been watching our every move. We might be underestimating her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;Then what about Lex? He&#39;s supposed to handle Lia at the wedding tomorrow. If Alina is watching, it&#39;s only a matter of time before she warns Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged in Bianca. They&#39;d spent so long planning every detail, and now everything seemed to be unraveling. Alina&#39;s sudden appearance left her feeling exposed. They couldn&#39;t afford to be reckless now, not with the wedding so close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s gaze shot to her phone. &#34;We need to reach Lex. If there&#39;s even a chance Alina&#39;s onto us, we have to tell him to stop. Just until we can get everything back under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dialed Lex&#39;s number, her fingers trembling slightly as she pressed the phone to her ear. It rang once, twice-then clicked over to voicemail. Frustration bubbled inside her as she tried again, with the same result. &#34;His line isn&#39;t going through,&#34; she muttered angrily, trying to keep her voice steady. &#34;This isn&#39;t good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s hands fidgeted nervously, her face mirroring Bianca&#39;s worry. &#34;What if he still goes through with it tomorrow? We can&#39;t have him do anything rash if Alina is watching. This is too risky, Bianca.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca clenched her jaw, forcing herself to think clearly. &#34;We need to make sure Lex doesn&#39;t act without knowing the full situation. If Alina&#39;s really spying on us, we&#39;ll be in deep trouble if Lex does anything tomorrow. But how are we supposed to contact him if he&#39;s ignoring our calls?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s face paled. &#34;You said you know him well, right? You can find him, or at least know someone who can reach him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca hesitated, a flash of uncertainty crossing her face. &#34;I don&#39;t know him as well as I made it seem. He&#39;s just someone I met randomly who seemed interested in working with us. But I don&#39;t know his circle or his habits well enough to track him down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s face fell, her anxiety growing with each word. &#34;Bianca, this is serious. We need someone who can get through to him and tell him to hold off. If Lex goes forward with the plan during the wedding, it&#39;s all over for us. Alina&#39;s probably already keeping an eye on everything we do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca clenched her fists, pushing down the rising panic. She had to stay calm, stay focused. &#34;We don&#39;t have time to second-guess, Jenny. We&#39;re getting an investigator. Someone discreet, who can track Lex down and stop him before he goes through with anything. I don&#39;t care what it costs-we can&#39;t let him jeopardize our plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded, pulling her phone out and scrolling through her contacts. &#34;I know someone reliable, someone who can keep things quiet and work fast. We&#39;ll have them look into Lex&#39;s whereabouts and get him a message if they can&#39;t find him directly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jenny made the call, Bianca sat back, her thoughts swirling. The pieces of their plan felt like they were slipping out of her hands, and all because of Alina. She could barely contain the anger rising within her. Alina had no right to meddle in something that didn&#39;t concern her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny ended the call, looking back at Bianca. &#34;They&#39;ll start immediately. They promised to keep it discreet, and they&#39;ll let us know if they find anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca forced herself to nod, though the knot in her stomach only tightened. &#34;Good. We need to be ready for anything tomorrow. If Alina is really onto us, she won&#39;t make it easy. We just have to stay one step ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But despite her own words, Bianca couldn&#39;t shake the dread that had settled deep in her chest. For the first time, she felt the gravity of the game they were playing. If Alina managed to expose them or warned Finn in time, everything would crumble. She couldn&#39;t afford to fail-not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll get through this,&#34; Jenny murmured, though her voice held a trace of doubt. &#34;As long as Lex doesn&#39;t mess things up tomorrow, we&#39;ll still have control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca tried to convince herself of the same, though the shadow of Alina&#39;s warning lingered in her mind. The feeling of being watched, of knowing someone was already a step ahead, was unnerving. But she couldn&#39;t let that stop her-not when she was so close to finally seeing Lia gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>124</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stepped through the front doors, the grandeur of Finn&#39;s estate felt even more imposing tonight. Everything seemed amplified, and for once, the place that I&#39;d become so familiar with felt foreign like I was walking into a well-laid trap. But I pushed the thoughts aside as I reminded myself that tonight wasn&#39;t just any night-it was the dinner party, an engagement party of sorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After slipping off my shoes, I headed to my room and began preparing for the evening. I picked out a satin dress in deep emerald green that hugged my curves and had an elegant sweep along the floor. The color was bold but refined, exactly the sort of look that Finn liked to see on me. As I was adjusting the neckline, I heard a gentle knock on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; I called, thinking it was one of the house staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn stepped inside, looking impossibly polished in a tailored black suit that made his figure even more imposing. In his hands, he held a small, velvet box. He gave me a half-smile, his usual intensity softened just a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I brought you something for tonight,&#34; he said, his voice low as he stepped closer. He opened the box, revealing a breathtaking diamond necklace that caught the light from every angle. The stones sparkled brilliantly, each cut into flawless gems, and I couldn&#39;t help but gasp a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s beautiful,&#34; I managed, my fingers brushing over the diamonds as he lifted them from the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he reached behind me and fastened the necklace around my neck. His fingers were steady, but his gaze was intense, as though he were trying to read my thoughts. Once he was done, I caught his eyes in the mirror, and for a moment, we both just stood there, silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There,&#34; he said, voice gruff. &#34;Now you&#39;re ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one last lingering glance, he left, and I took a deep breath, trying to settle my nerves. Everything about tonight felt off, and I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that I was walking a fine line between worlds, my loyalties split, with secrets on all sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I descended the stairs, the hall was already filled with people. The decorations were elegant, with muted lighting casting a warm glow over the room. I spotted Benedicta near the entrance, waving at me, and I felt an immediate wave of relief. Her presence grounded me; she was a reminder of what I was fighting for, and her support meant everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the evening unfolded, I noticed how everyone seemed engrossed in their own world, whispering behind glasses of champagne, clinking glasses, and sharing warm smiles. Yet, there was a tension in the air, one that I couldn&#39;t quite place. Every so often, I caught sight of Alina moving in and out of the hall. She looked more intense than usual, her gaze darting to various corners of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More unsettling, however, was the way Bianca and Jenny seemed on edge. Their laughter was forced, their smiles brittle, and every few minutes, they&#39;d exchange hurried glances that held a mixture of anxiety and dread. They were nervous, and that worried me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I slipped away, pretending I needed a moment outside for air. I ducked into a quiet hallway, far from the bustling hall, and quickly dialed Luca&#39;s number. He picked up almost instantly as if he&#39;d been waiting for my call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia?&#34; he asked, his tone immediately serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I wanted to tell you something strange is going on. Alina&#39;s acting suspiciously, coming in and out of the hall. And Bianca and Jenny-they look nervous. I think they&#39;re up to something. I just wanted to make sure we&#39;re not walking into any surprises,&#34; I whispered, casting a glance around me to ensure no one could overhear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause, and then Luca&#39;s voice softened, soothing yet firm. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Lia. Everything is under control. I&#39;ve made arrangements for anything they might try. Stick to the plan, and don&#39;t let them see you&#39;re nervous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words calmed me, and I let out a shaky breath. &#34;Are you sure?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely. I have eyes on them, and I&#39;ll know if anything changes. Just go back in there and act like tonight is exactly what it should be. The less they suspect, the better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat, I nodded to myself, despite him not being able to see it. &#34;All right, I trust you, Luca. But stay close, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; he promised, and with that, we hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened, smoothing out the folds of my dress and steadying my breathing. Luca&#39;s reassurance lingered in my mind as I made my way back to the hall. I slipped inside, doing my best to look at ease, and found Benedicta waiting for me. She gave me a small smile, oblivious to the undercurrents pulsing through the room. For her, tonight was nothing more than an engagement party, a new beginning. I held onto that image, hoping it would carry me through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night went on, I tried to stay engaged in conversations, nodding and smiling in all the right places. Alina&#39;s frequent disappearances and Bianca&#39;s stolen glances toward me still prickled my nerves, but I kept Luca&#39;s words in mind. I stayed composed, unbothered, exactly what they didn&#39;t expect. This was just the beginning, I reminded myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as I sipped my champagne, casting a casual look across the room, I knew I was playing a delicate game. A game that only I-and perhaps Luca-could understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked briskly to my car, tension knotting in my stomach. Lex was supposed to check in with me this morning, but all I got was radio silence. Something was off, and I needed answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding into the driver&#39;s seat, I dialed his number as I started the car. It rang and rang, but no answer. My fingers tapped against the steering wheel impatiently as I drove toward the last place we&#39;d met. I dialed again, feeling a sense of dread creeping in. If Lex had been involved with Bianca and Jenny&#39;s plans, anything could have happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the call connected. I opened my mouth to speak, but before I could say anything, the unmistakable sound of gunfire exploded from the other end. My heart dropped. There was no mistaking it-Lex was in trouble, or worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead. My hands tightened around the steering wheel as I tried to process what had just happened. Who would take out Lex? And why now, right when we needed him to keep Bianca and Jenny&#39;s plans from spiraling out of control?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth, forcing myself to stay calm as I sped toward the meeting place. Lex might not have been a saint, but he was a necessary piece in our plan, and whoever took him out clearly knew what they were doing. This changed everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I pulled into the empty lot where we&#39;d last met, a strange silence hung over the place. I scanned the area, half expecting to see a shadow move or a flash of a weapon. But there was nothing-only the eerie quiet as if the whole place was holding its breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got out of the car, my senses on high alert. My mind was racing with questions. Had Lex betrayed me, or had someone else gotten to him before he could relay any vital information? Either way, I knew one thing for certain-someone was making moves, and they were closer than I&#39;d realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plans we&#39;d carefully set in motion now seemed like they were hanging by a thread. With Lex gone, I&#39;d lost an essential link to Bianca&#39;s inner circle, and now, there was no one to monitor her plans directly. I couldn&#39;t be everywhere at once, but I&#39;d have to act fast to keep everything from collapsing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got back into my car, dialing Lia&#39;s number. If anything, she had to know what was going on. I couldn&#39;t let her walk into a trap, not when it was clear we were up against someone ruthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the phone rang, I kept my gaze on the road ahead, eyes scanning every movement, every shadow. Tonight was the engagement party, but now, it felt like a countdown to something far darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia picked up. &#34;Luca?&#34; Her voice was soft, uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen carefully,&#34; I said, voice low. &#34;Lex is gone. Something happened, and I don&#39;t know who&#39;s responsible yet. Just keep your guard up tonight. Don&#39;t let anyone catch you off balance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long pause, and then, &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>125</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I made my way through the elegant crowd, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling of anxiety clawing at my chest. The engagement party was in full swing, with laughter and music filling the air, but my mind was miles away, focused on the ominous phone call I&#39;d had with Luca. The uncertainty surrounding Lex&#39;s fate left a knot of dread in my stomach. It was all I could do to keep a calm face in front of the guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta, ever so perceptive, leaned over and placed a comforting hand on my arm. &#34;Lia, you seem on edge tonight. Is something bothering you?&#34; she asked, her voice soft but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a shaky breath, realizing I couldn&#39;t keep this from her. She was like a mother to me, and if anyone could help me, it was her. &#34;Benedicta, Luca called me earlier,&#34; I whispered, glancing around to make sure no one was listening. &#34;He said Lex is missing. He heard gunshots on the line, and he thinks something terrible has happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened slightly, but she kept her composure. &#34;Oh, Lia,&#34; she murmured, her hand squeezing mine. &#34;You&#39;re worried that this is more than a simple disappearance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, feeling the weight of it all crashing down on me. &#34;Yes and there&#39;s more. Ever since I arrived tonight, I&#39;ve noticed Jenny and Bianca acting strange. They&#39;re restless, whispering to each other, constantly looking over their shoulders. I have this gut feeling that they know something about what happened to Lex.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s gaze was calm and calculating. She gave me a reassuring smile but shook her head. &#34;Lia, listen to me carefully. Don&#39;t jump to conclusions. I know you&#39;re worried, and I don&#39;t doubt your instincts, but sometimes our fears can lead us down the wrong path. Leave this to Luca. He&#39;s already working to get to the bottom of it. The best thing you can do now is focus on tonight and act as though nothing is wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let her words sink in, knowing she was right. Benedicta always had a way of grounding me, of keeping me from letting my emotions get the better of me. I forced myself to take a deep breath, letting the tension in my shoulders release just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Finn approached us, a warm smile on his face. &#34;Benedicta,&#34; he greeted her, taking her hand respectfully. &#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to have you here tonight. You did a remarkable job raising Lia. She&#39;s strong, intelligent, and everything I could hope for in a partner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta returned his smile, clearly pleased by his praise. &#34;Thank you, Finn. Lia is like a daughter to me, and I&#39;m thrilled she&#39;s found someone who appreciates her qualities. I can see you&#39;re both a good match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of pride touched my heart at her words, but the underlying tension remained. Finn and Benedicta exchanged a few more pleasantries before he excused himself to mingle with the other guests, leaving us alone again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he was out of earshot, I turned back to Benedicta, the knot in my stomach tightening. &#34;I don&#39;t know how to explain it, but something feels off about Jenny and Bianca. They&#39;re hiding something, and I feel like it&#39;s connected to what happened to Lex. Every time I look at them, they seem nervous, like they&#39;re waiting for something to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta regarded me thoughtfully, her expression unreadable. &#34;Lia, you may be right, but jumping to confront them could put you at risk. Bianca, especially, is not someone to underestimate. Let Luca handle it. He knows what he&#39;s doing, and he won&#39;t let anything happen to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, chewing my lip as I considered her advice. &#34;I understand, but waiting around, pretending everything is normal it&#39;s not easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. &#34;I know, but trust me. Luca has his ways, and he&#39;ll keep you safe. You have to play the part tonight, Lia. Don&#39;t let anyone suspect that you&#39;re worried. Blend in, smile, and let Luca do the heavy lifting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I nodded, feeling a renewed sense of resolve. Benedicta was right. Luca was handling it, and I had to trust that he knew what he was doing. For now, I needed to focus on the engagement and let my suspicions lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the evening wore on, I kept an eye on Bianca and Jenny from a distance. Their behavior hadn&#39;t changed-Jenny kept whispering to Bianca, and Bianca&#39;s gaze darted around the room as if she were expecting someone to approach her at any moment. They were definitely hiding something, but what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I felt a warm hand on my shoulder. I turned to see Benedicta smiling at me, her eyes kind but filled with a silent reminder to keep calm. &#34;Lia, remember what we talked about. Breathe, and focus on the night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to smile back at her, nodding as I tried to push my worries aside. She was right. Tonight was too important to let my anxiety show. With a deep breath, I pulled my shoulders back, determined to face the night with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, as I moved through the crowd, I slipped out onto the balcony for a moment to gather my thoughts. I reached for my phone, dialing Luca&#39;s number. When he picked up, his voice was low and calm. &#34;Lia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re here, Luca. Jenny and Bianca are acting strange. I feel like they&#39;re on edge almost as if they know about Lex,&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s response was measured. &#34;Everything is under control, Lia. Don&#39;t let them suspect you know anything. Stay calm, and go back inside. I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reassurance brought me a sense of calm, and I thanked him before hanging up. Tucking my phone away, I took one last deep breath, steeling myself to return to the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I re-entered the hall, I noticed Benedicta&#39;s approving smile. She had been right about everything. For now, I would follow her advice and stay focused on the night. I&#39;d let Luca do his work, and I&#39;d do mine: act like the perfect fiancée and leave my suspicions hidden-at least, for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>126</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engagement party felt like it was closing in on us. Bianca and I could barely sit still after Alina&#39;s cryptic warning earlier. She knew about our plan, and the look in her eyes said she was far from done with us. The idea of staying here, surrounded by people who might catch on to our plans, was unbearable. We exchanged nervous glances, silently agreeing to slip out. We needed to see Lex, regroup, and figure out what to do now that Alina was in the loop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we sneaked toward the exit, glancing over our shoulders every few steps, the cool night air hit us like a wake-up call, and I felt a small rush of relief. But just as we reached the car, I heard a voice behind us. &#34;And where do you think you&#39;re going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both spun around to see Alina standing a few feet away, her arms crossed, a smirk pulling at the corners of her lips. The way she looked at us was unnerving, her eyes practically daring us to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The party&#39;s not over,&#34; she said casually. &#34;Shouldn&#39;t you be inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca shot her a venomous look. &#34;Mind your business, Alina. I&#39;m warning you-don&#39;t push us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina chuckled, the sound low and mocking. &#34;You&#39;re warning me? I&#39;m curious, Bianca exactly how do you plan to make good on that threat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Bianca tense beside me, but before she could say something she&#39;d regret, I grabbed her arm and pulled her toward the car. &#34;Let&#39;s go, Bianca. She&#39;s not worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s laughter followed us as we got into the car, but I forced myself to ignore it, shutting the door firmly behind us. As soon as we were inside, I shot Bianca a look that hopefully conveyed the urgency of the situation. She exhaled sharply, shaking her head as we pulled out of the driveway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive to Lex&#39;s place was silent, the tension between us thick. Every now and then, I&#39;d catch Bianca fidgeting or muttering to herself. I couldn&#39;t shake the unease Alina&#39;s words had stirred in me, and the fact that she seemed to know so much unnerved me. But right now, we needed to focus on Lex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we pulled up to Lex&#39;s house, something felt off. The front door was slightly ajar, swaying gently as if someone had entered before us. I exchanged a worried glance with Bianca. This wasn&#39;t like Lex at all-he was always careful about security, especially with the stakes so high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he leave the door open?&#34; Bianca whispered, her voice barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;Let&#39;s just get inside and find out what&#39;s going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we stepped inside, an unpleasant smell hit us immediately. The place was eerily silent, with an odd stillness in the air. Every instinct in me screamed that something was wrong, but we pressed forward, moving down the hallway that led to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the door, Bianca pushed it open slowly. What we saw inside made my stomach drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, in the bathtub, was Lex. His body was sprawled out in the water, motionless, his skin pale and sickly. The once-clear water had turned murky, and an overpowering stench filled the room. It was obvious he&#39;d been dead for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca clamped a hand over her mouth, her eyes wide with horror. I could feel my own heart hammering against my chest, my mind barely processing what I was seeing. Lex gone? How?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to get out of here,&#34; I whispered, tugging on Bianca&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as we turned to leave, a sudden flash lit up the hallway, casting brief shadows across our bodies. We froze, dread pooling in the pit of my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see that?&#34; Bianca whispered, her voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, scanning the area around us. It felt like someone was watching us, but the hallway was empty. There were no footsteps, no sign of anyone nearby. Yet the flash had been real, unmistakable, like a camera snapping photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, let&#39;s go,&#34; I hissed, pulling Bianca with me as we stumbled back through the hall and out the front door. My nerves were frayed, every sound amplified as if someone was following us. We practically ran to the car, our breaths coming in short, panicked bursts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, Bianca locked the doors, her face pale and terrified. She glanced around, her eyes darting from one side of the street to the other as if expecting someone to step out from the shadows. &#34;Jenny do you think someone&#39;s following us? Taking pictures?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I replied, my voice barely above a whisper. &#34;But we need to get out of here. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca didn&#39;t need any more convincing. She started the car, and we peeled away from Lex&#39;s house, the tires screeching as we sped down the road. My heart was still pounding, my mind racing with questions. Who could have been taking those pictures? Was it Alina? Had she somehow followed us?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca gripped the wheel tightly, her knuckles white. &#34;Jenny what are we going to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I replied honestly, staring out the window, half-expecting to see a car following us. &#34;But this changes everything. We need to figure out who&#39;s behind this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca took a shaky breath, glancing at me. &#34;Do you think it was Alina? Could she have set this up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s possible,&#34; I admitted, though I couldn&#39;t be sure. Alina knew something, and she&#39;d already made it clear that she was onto us. But could she really have gone this far?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of Alina orchestrating this felt far-fetched, yet nothing seemed impossible at this point. We were dealing with someone who had no problem crossing boundaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we drove back toward the main part of town, Bianca&#39;s phone rang. She picked it up, her hands shaking slightly. But when she saw the caller ID, her face went pale, and she quickly declined the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was it?&#34; I asked, my pulse quickening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An unknown number,&#34; she whispered, her voice thick with fear. &#34;Jenny what if it&#39;s them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both fell silent, the weight of Lex&#39;s death and the unsettling flash at his house pressing heavily on us. Whatever was happening, we were in far deeper than we&#39;d ever intended. And now, more than ever, it felt like someone was pulling the strings in ways we couldn&#39;t see or control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>129</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city lights blurred past as I gripped the steering wheel, my thoughts racing as I headed toward Lex&#39;s place. Lex was dead. Not just dead-taken out. The guy had his share of enemies, but this? This was no random hit. Someone was making a point, and I&#39;d heard it loud and clear. They wanted Lex silenced, and now they&#39;d have everyone he worked with looking over their shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I killed the headlights as I turned onto his street, parking a few blocks away. If whoever did this was still lurking, I didn&#39;t want to be the next easy target. The night air was heavy, and every shadow seemed to watch as I made my way toward his apartment building, my senses on high alert. The whole place was quiet, almost too quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached his door and noticed it was slightly ajar, the lock busted. Whoever had done this wasn&#39;t interested in covering their tracks. I pushed the door open, my pulse hammering as I stepped inside, gun drawn. The place reeked of metal and stale air, an all-too-familiar scent. I knew what I&#39;d find even before I saw him, lying there in the tub, eyes wide open and lifeless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, keeping my emotions locked tight. Lex may not have been the most reliable, but he didn&#39;t deserve this. It was brutal-a calculated move meant to send fear rippling through everyone who crossed paths with him. I&#39;d seen scenes like this before, but this time, it felt personal. And whoever did this wanted it to feel that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it, Lex,&#34; I muttered under my breath. He&#39;d warned me-said something about Jenny and Bianca having their hands in something big. I&#39;d brushed him off, chalking it up to paranoia. Now, I wasn&#39;t so sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved through the apartment, keeping my eyes peeled for anything that might give me a lead. Lex wasn&#39;t the type to leave incriminating evidence lying around, but maybe, just maybe, he&#39;d stashed something useful. I rummaged through drawers, checked under tables, and even peered behind his old bookshelf. Nothing. Whoever had done this had been thorough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was about to give up, I caught sight of a small, red light blinking in the corner near the ceiling. A surveillance camera. Lex always was paranoid. I felt a flicker of hope-if that camera was working, it might&#39;ve caught something. I grabbed a chair and reached up, pulling down the camera and carefully removing the memory card. Maybe this little piece of tech would give me the answers Lex never could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a faint flash lit up the corner of the room. My heart leaped-I wasn&#39;t alone. I whipped around, gun raised, but saw nothing. The flash was gone, and the room was still. But my instincts screamed at me. Someone was watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved fast, pocketing the memory card and making a beeline for the door. Whoever had taken that picture was gone, but I didn&#39;t have time to wait around to find out if they&#39;d be back. As I slipped out the door, I kept my eyes scanning every corner, every shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I got back to my car, I&#39;d worked out three possibilities. Either someone was watching Lex&#39;s apartment waiting for a chance to strike again, or someone had followed me here, thinking I was part of Lex&#39;s scheme. Or-and this was the one that unsettled me the most-someone already knew I&#39;d come looking and wanted me to feel the same fear Lex must have felt in his last moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding into the driver&#39;s seat, I locked the doors, took a deep breath, and popped the memory card into my phone. A shoddy recording, filled with static and brief glimpses of Lex&#39;s last moments. But it was enough. I could make out two shadowy figures-a man and a woman, both familiar. Bianca and Jenny. They&#39;d been here, likely moments before his death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pieces fell into place, and a surge of anger twisted in my gut. So, they were involved after all. They&#39;d tried to act innocent, playing it cool at the party, but they were hiding something much darker than I&#39;d thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why kill Lex now? And who else might be pulling the strings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last frame of the video showed Lex, frozen in fear, his eyes darting toward the door before the screen cut to black. He&#39;d seen his killers coming, knew they were coming for him, and they&#39;d made sure to keep him quiet. The thought sickened me, but it also lit a fire in me. If Bianca and Jenny thought they could play this game without me knowing, they were dead wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started the engine, already forming my next move. If they wanted to play dirty, I&#39;d go even deeper. Whatever they were up to, I&#39;d find out. And if they were connected to this tangled web of lies and murder, they&#39;d have a lot more to worry about than just me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked Benedicta to her car, the cool night air settled around us, soothing yet strangely heavy. I gave her a small smile, reaching for her hands. &#34;Send my love to Merlin, will you?&#34; I said softly, picturing my son&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta nodded, her eyes warm. &#34;Of course, Lia. He misses you, you know. He can&#39;t wait to see you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, feeling the tug in my chest. &#34;I miss him too. Soon, I&#39;ll have him back in my arms, just like old times.&#34; I tried to keep my voice steady, but the thought of Merlin, far away from me, brought a pang of longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta reached out, squeezing my shoulder. &#34;Stay focused. Tomorrow is important. Get through it, and everything else will fall into place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she drove off, I took a deep breath and turned back toward the house. I walked through the doors, greeted by the quiet murmurs of the remaining guests and the occasional clink of glasses. I found Finn near the entrance, looking perfectly composed, his gaze following me as I walked toward him. He smiled, an unreadable look in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Benedicta get off safely?&#34; he asked, slipping an arm around my waist as he leaned in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she&#39;s on her way home,&#34; I replied, offering a smile that didn&#39;t quite reach my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked with me to the staircase, stopping briefly. &#34;Tomorrow is a big day,&#34; he murmured, his eyes searching mine. &#34;Are you excited?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to nod, knowing that anything less would spark his curiosity. &#34;Of course, Finn. I can&#39;t wait,&#34; I said, though my words felt hollow. &#34;It&#39;s just been such a long day, and I could really use some rest.&#34; I offered a slight smile, hoping he wouldn&#39;t press further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good idea. Get some sleep,&#34; he said, giving me a soft peck on my forehead before turning to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as his footsteps faded down the hall, I shut the door behind me and turned the lock, sealing myself into the quiet sanctuary of my room. I took a few breaths, steadying myself. The weight of the day seemed to press down harder, the silence amplifying my racing thoughts. Lex&#39;s murder. Finn&#39;s unreadable expression. And the party tomorrow, where everyone would have eyes on us, waiting to see what unfolds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitating, I reached for my phone, dialing Luca&#39;s number. It rang a few times before he picked up, his voice a low murmur. &#34;Lia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; I whispered, glancing around as if someone might be listening. &#34;What&#39;s the latest? Did you find anything else about Lex&#39;s death? I can&#39;t shake this feeling that there&#39;s more going on than we know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed heavily. &#34;You&#39;re not wrong. This goes deeper than we thought. I managed to check out Lex&#39;s place and trust me, it wasn&#39;t a pretty sight. Whoever did it was efficient, almost as if they&#39;d planned it down to the last second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of Lex, cold and lifeless, sent a shiver through me. &#34;Do you think Bianca and Jenny could&#39;ve been involved?&#34; I asked, my voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s looking that way, but it&#39;s not that simple. I think someone else is pulling strings from the shadows. I spotted a camera in Lex&#39;s apartment, but as soon as I took it, I felt like I was being watched. Like someone was documenting my every move.&#34; His tone was dark, tinged with frustration. &#34;I got out of there fast, but I&#39;m almost certain whoever&#39;s behind this is a step ahead of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip, trying to steady my nerves. The thought of being tangled in something this dangerous made my skin crawl, but I needed answers. &#34;So what do we do next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now, play along. Act as if nothing is out of the ordinary. Whoever is behind this, they&#39;re expecting us to make a wrong move, and we can&#39;t give them that satisfaction. Tomorrow, during the party, keep an eye on Bianca and Jenny. Don&#39;t confront them, just observe. And stay close to people you trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; I murmured, though unease pooled in my stomach. &#34;But Luca this doesn&#39;t feel like something I can just pretend isn&#39;t happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then spoke softly. &#34;I know, Lia. But trust me-we&#39;re going to figure this out. Just stay sharp, and I&#39;ll be watching too. We&#39;ll get through tomorrow, and then we can strategize our next steps.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, and I found myself staring at the screen, my thoughts churning with everything he&#39;d said. Part of me wanted to call Benedicta back, to tell her everything, but I knew I couldn&#39;t drag her deeper into this mess. She already had enough on her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled, feeling the weight of tomorrow settle heavily upon me. If everything went according to plan, I&#39;d get through the engagement party, all smiles and nods, watching Bianca and Jenny for any slip-ups. But I couldn&#39;t shake the gnawing feeling that something was about to go horribly wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curling up in bed, I lay there in the dark, eyes wide open, as the pieces of this twisted puzzle filled my mind. The people I trusted, the enemies I couldn&#39;t yet see, and the future that felt more uncertain than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow would come soon enough, and with it, every answer I was both desperate and afraid to uncover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>129</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I shut the door to my room, I pulled out my phone, dialed a number, and waited. The line rang twice before a deep voice answered on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; he asked, his tone steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep an eye on Bianca and Jenny,&#34; I instructed, keeping my voice low. &#34;I want to know everything they&#39;re planning, every move they make. Don&#39;t miss a single detail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause on the other end. &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll make sure they&#39;re covered. Do you expect them to act soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a breath, choosing my words carefully. &#34;Yes. They&#39;re on edge, and when people are desperate, they make mistakes. I want to be one step ahead of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; he replied, the confidence in his tone reassuring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended the call and slipped my phone back into my pocket, feeling a sense of satisfaction. Everything was in place. I knew Bianca and Jenny were hiding something dangerous, and now I would finally get to the bottom of it. If they thought they could outsmart me, they were in for a rude awakening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my door, ready to head back to the party, but as I stepped out, I nearly collided with someone. Standing there, as if she had been waiting for me, was Benedicta. Her presence was unexpected, and I felt my guard immediately rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benedicta,&#34; I said, forcing a polite smile. &#34;What are you doing in the main house? Aren&#39;t you a guest? You should know your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked startled but quickly regained her composure, offering me a disarming smile. &#34;Oh, I I was looking for the bathroom. I must have taken a wrong turn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I studied her carefully, noting the way her eyes darted away from mine. &#34;The bathroom is in the other direction.&#34; I pointed down the hall, narrowing my eyes slightly. &#34;Next time, be more careful. It&#39;s easy to get lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta gave a small nod and headed toward the bathroom. As she disappeared down the hall, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that her story was just a little too convenient. The way she avoided eye contact, the excuse of getting lost-it didn&#39;t sit right with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her retreating figure, my suspicions growing. In the back of my mind, a thought lingered, echoing with a fierce intensity: I&#39;ll find out what you&#39;re up to, Benedicta. Whatever secrets you&#39;re hiding, they won&#39;t stay hidden for long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one last look down the hallway, I shook off the unease and made my way back to the party. The music, the laughter, and the clinking glasses filled the air as I rejoined the crowd, slipping back into the flow of the celebration as if nothing had happened. But my mind was already calculating, plotting the next steps, certain that both Benedicta and Bianca&#39;s games were about to end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I received the address for Lex&#39;s place, I hit the gas and drove through the quiet streets, my mind racing. Something was off, and I could feel it in the pit of my stomach. The silence on his end, the missed calls-it didn&#39;t add up. Lex was a lot of things, but careless wasn&#39;t one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally reached the house, a chill ran down my spine. The front door was left slightly open, swaying in the night breeze. I stepped out of the car, moving cautiously as I approached the entrance, my senses heightened. There was an eerie stillness that wrapped around the place, a silence that felt unnatural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the house was dark except for a dim light coming from the hallway. The scent of something stale hung in the air, making my stomach turn. I didn&#39;t need to go far to sense that something terrible had happened. As I ventured further into the house, I finally saw the bathroom door left ajar, hinting at the gruesome scene within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight was chilling, but I forced myself to stay composed. Lex&#39;s lifeless body was sprawled in the bathtub, the water dark and murky. It was a brutal reminder of the lengths some people would go to in order to silence those who stood in their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, steadying myself as I scanned the room. There were no obvious signs of a struggle, but the silence spoke volumes. Whoever did this wanted to send a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away from the bathroom, my mind working quickly. If anyone had left traces, I needed to find them before someone else did. Moving to the main hallway, I spotted a small security camera mounted on the wall. A sense of relief washed over me; maybe there was still a chance of recovering evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as I moved closer to inspect it, my heart sank. I couldn&#39;t risk leaving a trail for anyone else to follow. Gritting my teeth, I reached up and disabled the camera, effectively erasing any footage that might compromise me-or anyone else who mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I finished, a sudden flash caught my attention. For a split second, the light hit my face, almost like a camera flash. My instincts kicked in, and I spun around, scanning the darkness around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing. No footsteps, no voices, just that single flash that left me feeling exposed. It could have been a passerby, or worse, someone waiting for me to make a move. Whoever had taken Lex out might still be nearby, watching, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to remain calm, carefully retracing my steps back to the front door. Every muscle in my body was tense as I slipped outside, moving toward my car, my eyes scanning the area for any sign of movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, I locked the doors and gripped the steering wheel, my pulse pounding in my ears. Whoever was responsible for this wasn&#39;t just a threat to Lex-they were coming after everyone involved, and they were ruthless enough to make it clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I started the engine and pulled away from the house, my mind was already on high alert. I needed answers, and I needed them fast. This was no longer a simple game of strategy; it was a race for survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if someone thought they could take me down that easily, they were about to find out just how wrong they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>130</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands trembled slightly as I dialed yet another number. The list of contacts I&#39;d carefully curated over the years dwindled with every unanswered call, leaving me more frustrated with each passing minute. Yet, I couldn&#39;t give up now-not with everything on the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you heard anything?&#34; I asked as soon as the line connected, my voice sharp, betraying the unease bubbling beneath my polished exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing definitive,&#34; came the clipped response. &#34;But we&#39;re still looking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended the call with a terse thank-you and leaned back in my chair, pressing my fingers against my temples. The tension pounding behind my eyes was unbearable, but I didn&#39;t dare stop. Lex&#39;s death had thrown everything into chaos, and the longer I remained in the dark, the more vulnerable we became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the chime of a new notification broke through the silence, I straightened immediately, my pulse quickening. My investigator had sent something-a video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of my finger, I opened the file, my breath catching as the footage played. The quality was grainy, but it was unmistakable: Luca. The timestamp confirmed it. He had been in Lex&#39;s house after his death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, triumphant smile crept across my face. &#34;So, you&#39;re not as clean as you pretend to be,&#34; I whispered, leaning back and replaying the video. My mind began to spin with possibilities. This could be the leverage I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the sound of approaching footsteps pulled me from my thoughts. I scrambled to close the video and lock my phone, shoving it under a stack of papers just as the door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny stepped in, her eyes darting around the room before settling on me. &#34;Any updates?&#34; she asked, her tone anxious but laced with impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a neutral expression, shaking my head. &#34;Nothing yet. I&#39;ve been making calls, but no one seems to know anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny frowned, pacing across the room. &#34;We need answers, Bianca. This isn&#39;t just about Lex anymore. If anyone finds out how deeply we&#39;re involved, it&#39;s over for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said, keeping my voice calm even as my fingers itched to grab my phone and rewatch the video. &#34;But panicking won&#39;t help. We have to tread carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny stopped and turned to face me, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. &#34;I hate this. Every time I look over my shoulder, I feel like someone&#39;s watching. First, Alina with her cryptic threats, and now this? I can&#39;t shake the feeling that we&#39;re being hunted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sent a shiver down my spine, but I kept my composure. &#34;No one knows, Jenny. And as long as we stick to the plan, they won&#39;t. We just have to be smart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny sighed, running a hand through her hair. &#34;I don&#39;t know, Bianca. I&#39;m starting to think we should just leave. Get out before it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And do what? Run for the rest of our lives?&#34; I snapped, my frustration spilling over. &#34;That&#39;s not an option. We have to see this through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny stared at me for a moment before nodding reluctantly. &#34;Fine. But if anything goes wrong, I&#39;m not sticking around to find out what happens next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she left the room, I let out a breath I hadn&#39;t realized I was holding. The tension between us was growing, but I couldn&#39;t let that distract me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for my phone, unlocking it to stare at the paused frame of Luca leaving Lex&#39;s house. His expression was unreadable, but the sight of him there was damning enough. If he thought he could play the hero and pin everything on us, he was sorely mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This video was my insurance. My safety net. And when the time came, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to use it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for now, I had to keep playing the game, even if it meant pretending to be as clueless as Jenny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could know what I had, not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>_____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drove through the quiet streets, my grip on the steering wheel tightening with every passing moment. The image of Lex&#39;s lifeless body in the tub haunted me, replaying in vivid detail. Whoever had killed him wanted chaos-no, they wanted to dismantle every thread connecting us to the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I pulled up to Benedicta&#39;s house, I took a deep breath, trying to gather my thoughts. I needed her advice, her perspective. This wasn&#39;t a battle I could fight alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open before I could even knock. Benedicta stood there, her eyes narrowing with concern as she looked me over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; she said softly, stepping aside to let me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed her into the cozy living room, the faint scent of lavender calming my nerves just a bit. She motioned for me to sit, but I remained standing, unable to keep still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; she asked, crossing her arms and leaning against the armrest of the sofa. &#34;You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled sharply, running a hand through my hair. &#34;It&#39;s Lex. He&#39;s dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened, but she stayed silent, urging me to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went to his house after piecing together his location,&#34; I explained, pacing back and forth. &#34;When I got there, I found him in the tub-drowned. The stench was unbearable, Benedicta. He&#39;s been dead for days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. &#34;Who who could have done this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the thing,&#34; I said, stopping to look at her. &#34;I don&#39;t think Bianca or Jenny had anything to do with it. Sure, they&#39;re reckless and desperate, but this?&#34; I shook my head. &#34;This feels calculated. Someone is trying to frame them or, worse, cover their own tracks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta sank into the sofa, her face pale. &#34;Does Lia know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not all of it,&#34; I admitted. &#34;She knows something&#39;s wrong, but I haven&#39;t told her the full story. She doesn&#39;t need to carry that weight, especially not with everything else going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta nodded slowly, her gaze distant. &#34;What about tomorrow? The wedding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists, the thought of Lia marrying Finn twisting my stomach into knots. &#34;It&#39;s the only way to keep her safe. Whoever is behind this they&#39;re dangerous. If they think Lia knows anything or is a threat to their plan, they won&#39;t hesitate to come after her. Marrying Finn might give her a layer of protection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;ll crush you,&#34; Benedicta said, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked away, unable to meet her eyes. &#34;It&#39;s not about me. It&#39;s about Lia. As long as she&#39;s alive and unharmed, I&#39;ll deal with whatever I have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta stood and walked over to me, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder. &#34;You&#39;re making a tough choice, Luca. But I know you&#39;re doing it for the right reasons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, swallowing the lump in my throat. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze before stepping back. &#34;Stay strong. Lia&#39;s going to need you, even if she doesn&#39;t realize it right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to leave, the weight of the conversation pressing heavily on my chest. As I stepped outside and got into my car, the dam I&#39;d been holding back finally began to crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands gripped the steering wheel tightly as a wave of emotions crashed over me. I wanted to scream, to punch something, to cry-but I couldn&#39;t. Not now. Not when so much was at stake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned my head against the steering wheel, my eyes stinging. &#34;Lia,&#34; I whispered, her name slipping from my lips like a prayer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I missed her. I missed her laughter, her stubbornness, the way she looked at me like I was the only one who mattered. But tomorrow, I&#39;d have to let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought tore me apart, but I couldn&#39;t let my feelings cloud my judgment. Lia&#39;s safety came first, no matter how much it hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a shaky breath, wiping my face with the back of my hand before starting the engine. The night stretched endlessly ahead of me, filled with uncertainty and danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But one thing was clear: I&#39;d protect Lia, even if it cost me everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>131</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dream was terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was standing in a vast, empty hall adorned with wedding decorations. The air smelled metallic, thick, and suffocating. My wedding dress, pristine and white moments ago, was soaked with blood. The vibrant red seemed to pulse, a grotesque reminder of something I couldn&#39;t yet piece together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze fell downward, and there he was-Finn, lying in a pool of his own blood. His lifeless eyes stared up at me, accusing and hollow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands trembled as I looked down at them. I was holding a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...no, no, no!&#34; I screamed, the sound echoing through the empty hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to drop the knife, but it wouldn&#39;t leave my hand. My breaths came in short gasps, panic swelling in my chest. The walls around me seemed to close in, the decorations morphing into dark, clawed shapes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, faint laughter echoed. Low, guttural, and filled with malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spun around, searching for the source, but the hall was empty. The laughter grew louder until it consumed everything, drowning out even my frantic thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, I woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body jolted upright in bed, drenched in sweat. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst. My trembling hand instinctively went to my neck, clutching the necklace Finn had given me the previous night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of dream was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to calm my racing heart, but just then, I heard something-soft footsteps, the creak of my bedroom door moving ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes darted toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone had just left my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, panic gripping me as the remnants of the dream bled into reality. For a moment, I couldn&#39;t move, couldn&#39;t breathe. But then I forced myself to stand, my knees shaky beneath me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked toward the door cautiously and peeked into the hallway. It was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; I whispered, my voice barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hallway stretched out in both directions, dimly lit by the faint glow of a wall sconce. There was no one there, no sign of movement. But I was certain someone had been inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped back into the room, closing the door firmly behind me. My pulse refused to settle as I leaned against it, trying to process what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had it been real? Or was my mind still tangled in the nightmare?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t sleep for the rest of the night. Every creak, every gust of wind sent a jolt through me. My eyes stayed fixed on the door, waiting for some explanation, some sign of what-or who-I had heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time dawn broke, I felt drained, my nerves frayed from the sleepless night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock at the door startled me, and I jumped, my heart leaping into my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia? It&#39;s me, your makeup artist!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled shakily. &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, and she entered, her face lit with excitement, carrying a large suitcase filled with makeup and styling tools.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Lia!&#34; she said brightly. &#34;Today&#39;s the big day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Big day. Right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a smile, pushing the disturbing events of the night to the back of my mind. &#34;Good morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set up her workstation near the window, chattering away about how beautiful I&#39;d look, how lucky Finn was, and how this would be a day to remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she knew how unforgettable it already was-for all the wrong reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she began her work, brushing and blending, my thoughts drifted. The dream, the intruder, the ominous feeling gnawing at me-I couldn&#39;t ignore it. Something wasn&#39;t right, and I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that today wouldn&#39;t just be about my wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be about survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I adjusted the cufflinks on my shirt, trying to shake off the nervous energy that had been building all morning. Today was supposed to be the happiest day of my life, yet something about it felt...off. Lia had been distant last night, though I chalked it up to pre-wedding jitters. Still, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if there was something she wasn&#39;t telling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock at the door pulled me from my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; I called, turning toward the sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open, and Alina stepped inside. Her face was a mixture of determination and irritation, the kind she reserved for moments when she wanted to be heard-whether or not you agreed with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finn,&#34; she said, closing the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed. &#34;Alina, whatever it is, I don&#39;t have time right now. The wedding is in a few hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m here,&#34; she replied, crossing her arms. &#34;You can&#39;t marry her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, staring at her. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know exactly what I&#39;m talking about,&#34; she said, stepping closer. &#34;Lia is not the right person for you. She&#39;s hiding something-no, many things-and I can&#39;t just stand by and watch you ruin your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw tightened. &#34;Alina, we&#39;ve been over this. I love her. Whatever issues you have with Lia, keep them to yourself. Today is not the day for this conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be naive, Finn,&#34; she snapped. &#34;Love isn&#39;t enough when there are secrets and lies involved. You&#39;re blinded by your feelings for her, but I see her for what she truly is-a liability.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, trying to keep my temper in check. &#34;A liability? She&#39;s the woman I&#39;m about to marry, Alina. The woman I&#39;ve chosen to spend the rest of my life with. You don&#39;t have to like her, but you will respect her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m trying to protect you,&#34; she insisted, her voice rising. &#34;Do you think she&#39;s being honest with you? Why is she so close to Luca? Why does she always look like she&#39;s hiding something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fists clenched at my sides. &#34;Stop it, Alina. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know more than you think,&#34; she shot back. &#34;I&#39;ve seen the way she looks at Luca. Something is going on there, Finn, and if you go through with this marriage, you&#39;re only setting yourself up for heartbreak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough!&#34; I shouted, my voice echoing through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina flinched but didn&#39;t back down. &#34;Finn-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I interrupted, pointing toward the door. &#34;You&#39;ve said your piece. Now get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression hardened. &#34;You&#39;ll regret this,&#34; she said, her tone laced with anger and frustration. &#34;When everything falls apart, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away from her, unwilling to let her see the conflict her words had stirred within me. &#34;Get out, Alina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she didn&#39;t move. I could feel her gaze boring into my back, waiting for me to turn around, to say something-anything-that would give her an opening to continue the argument. But I remained silent, staring at my reflection in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I heard the door open and close, and the room fell quiet once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled, running a hand through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s words lingered, a nagging voice in the back of my mind. Was she right? Was Lia hiding something from me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. I couldn&#39;t think like that. Lia loved me, and I loved her. Whatever doubts Alina had were her own, not mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my head, I focused on the day ahead. This wedding wasn&#39;t just a ceremony-it was a declaration, a promise</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that no matter what challenges came our way, we would face them together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And not even Alina&#39;s doubts could change that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>132</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in front of the vanity, staring at my reflection. My makeup was flawless, my hair pinned up elegantly, and the dress shimmered in the sunlight streaming through the window. But no amount of glamour could hide the anxiety swirling in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft knock at the door pulled me from my thoughts. Aaid entered, bowing slightly. &#34;Ma&#39;am, Benedicta is here to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, trying to compose myself. &#34;Let her in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door opened, Benedicta stepped in a radiant smile on her face. She crossed the room and pulled me into a warm hug. &#34;My dear Lia,&#34; she whispered, her voice filled with emotion. &#34;You look beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a lump form in my throat. &#34;Thank you, Benedicta. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled back, her hands resting on my shoulders. &#34;It&#39;s a big day for you, and I just want you to know how proud I am. I wish you all the happiness in the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sincerity made my eyes sting, but I blinked the tears away. &#34;Thank you. That means so much to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta sat on the edge of the bed, watching as the makeup artist made a few final touches. &#34;Have you heard from Luca?&#34; I asked, trying to sound casual, though my heart raced with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta shook her head. &#34;No, not yet. He hasn&#39;t said anything to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, glancing at the closed door. &#34;I&#39;m thinking about stopping the wedding,&#34; I admitted quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened. &#34;Lia, what are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could explain, my phone buzzed on the table. My stomach dropped when I saw the name flashing on the screen. Luca. I snatched it up and answered quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; I said, my voice trembling, &#34;what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was calm but laced with urgency. &#34;Lia, listen to me carefully. There&#39;s someone out there more dangerous than Jenny and Bianca. You need to be extremely cautious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I asked, my fingers tightening around the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have all the details yet, but I know this-whoever it is, they&#39;re pulling the strings behind the scenes. Until we figure it out, you have to push through with this wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze. &#34;Luca, I can&#39;t. I don&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to,&#34; he interrupted. &#34;If something goes wrong and you back out, they might blame you for it. Staying the course is your safest option right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made my head spin. &#34;And what about you? Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause, and then his tone shifted. &#34;Be prepared, Lia. My brotherAlpha Deanis in town.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart stopped. &#34;Dean? Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know yet,&#34; Luca admitted. &#34;But his presence changes everything. Keep your guard up, and I&#39;ll be in touch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead before I could ask more questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the phone, my hands trembling. Benedicta must have noticed my expression because she came over and took my hands in hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, what is it?&#34; she asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, repeating Luca&#39;s words. &#34;He said there&#39;s someone more dangerous out there, andhis brother, Dean, is in town.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s face tightened, but her voice was steady. &#34;Then we&#39;ll deal with it, Lia. You&#39;re not alone in this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if I can go through with this wedding,&#34; I whispered, tears threatening to spill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can,&#34; she said firmly. &#34;And you will. This is bigger than just you and Finn. Luca wouldn&#39;t ask you to do this if it wasn&#39;t important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, though uncertainty gnawed at me. Benedicta squeezed my hands and then motioned for the makeup artist to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the stylist worked, Benedicta sat beside me, her presence a source of comfort. &#34;Lia, you&#39;re stronger than you realize,&#34; she said softly. &#34;No matter what happens today, remember that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words gave me a small measure of confidence. I took a deep breath, letting the stylist finish pinning the veil into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked in the mirror again, I didn&#39;t just see a bride-I saw a woman about to walk into the unknown, determined to face whatever came her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone trembled in my hand as I paced my room, my tone sharp and commanding. &#34;Listen carefully,&#34; I barked, my patience worn thin. &#34;I don&#39;t care what it takes. Lia must be dealt with tonight. If you fail, don&#39;t bother showing your face to me again. Do I make myself clear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muffled response came from the other end, full of hesitation and fear. Typical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I snapped, ending the call abruptly and tossing the phone onto my desk. My heart was pounding with anticipation, my mind racing through the plan. This wedding had to be her last day on earth. Lia had meddled far too much, and her existence was a threat I couldn&#39;t allow to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft creak of my window brought me to a halt, my breath catching in my throat. Slowly, I turned toward the sound, and there he was-a man in a dark cloak, his back to me as he gracefully stepped into my room. The shadows seemed to cling to him as if they were an extension of his being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t need to see his face to know who it was. My lips parted, the name escaping in a whisper tinged with unease. &#34;Alpha Dean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned, the hood falling back to reveal his chiseled features and cold, piercing eyes. A cruel smile played on his lips as he regarded me, his presence overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina,&#34; he drawled, his voice smooth yet laced with menace. &#34;Still playing queen in a game you don&#39;t fully understand, I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened, trying to mask the unease curling in my stomach. &#34;What are you doing here? This wasn&#39;t part of the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean chuckled darkly, stepping closer with an air of predatory confidence. &#34;Plans change. Especially when they&#39;re as uninspired as yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words stung, but I held my ground. &#34;Lia has to go. She&#39;s a threat to everything we&#39;ve worked for. You agreed to this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile widened, but it didn&#39;t reach his eyes. &#34;Oh, I agree. But I&#39;ve had a change of heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned, confusion flickering across my face. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean leaned against the edge of my desk, his movements slow and deliberate. &#34;Why kill Lia,&#34; he began, &#34;when I can break her instead? Killing her would be quick, painless too easy. But keeping her alive, taking her as my pet Now that&#39;s a punishment worthy of Luca&#39;s betrayal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat at his words, my mind struggling to process his twisted logic. &#34;You can&#39;t be serious,&#34; I said, my voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I am.&#34; Dean&#39;s eyes glittered with dark amusement. &#34;Imagine Luca&#39;s face when he sees the love of his life in my grasp, completely under my control. The pain, the helplessness It&#39;ll be delicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach churned. This was beyond anything I had anticipated. &#34;Dean, this wasn&#39;t the deal. We were supposed to eliminate her, not this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head, his expression hardening. &#34;Are you questioning me, Alina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly dry. &#34;No,&#34; I said quickly. &#34;Of course not. But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are no &#39;buts,&#39;&#34; he interrupted, his tone icy. &#34;You wanted Lia out of the picture, and I&#39;ve found a way to do it that serves both our interests. You want her gone; I want Luca to suffer. Everyone wins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, my mind racing with doubts. Dean&#39;s plan was dangerous and unpredictable. It could backfire in ways we couldn&#39;t anticipate. But then again, opposing him was even more dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you need me to do?&#34; I asked, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s smile returned, sharp and predatory. &#34;Nothing, for now. Just keep playing your part and leave the rest to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded reluctantly, my instincts screaming at me to be cautious. &#34;Fine. But you&#39;ll need to stay hidden until the time is right. Luca is already suspicious, and Lia isn&#39;t as naive as you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean chuckled, pushing off the desk and moving toward the shadows. &#34;Oh, I&#39;m counting on it. The more they squirm, the sweeter the victory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He disappeared as quickly as he had appeared, leaving me alone with my thoughts. I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t what I had planned, but Dean&#39;s ruthlessness might just be the edge we needed to end this once and for all. Still, a nagging voice in the back of my mind warned me that we were playing with fire, and if we weren&#39;t careful, we&#39;d all get burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>133</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wedding bells rang loud and clear, echoing through the grand hall. My heart should have been soaring, but unease clung to me like a shadow. As the doors opened, Lia walked in, her arm linked with Benedicta&#39;s. She looked stunning in her gown, but there was a tension in her smile that only I seemed to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we exchanged vows, her voice was steady, but I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something was wrong. The officiant&#39;s words blurred as my wolf instincts screamed at me, warning of impending danger. Still, I pushed the unease aside. This was our moment, and I wouldn&#39;t let anything ruin it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may now kiss the bride,&#34; the officiant announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Lia&#39;s lips. The applause erupted around us, but all I could think about was the gnawing sensation that something was about to go terribly wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reception was a whirlwind of laughter and celebration. Guests filled the hall, the sound of clinking glasses and cheerful chatter blending with the music. Lia sat beside me, her eyes distant as if her mind was miles away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; I leaned closer, keeping my voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded quickly, forcing a smile. &#34;I&#39;m fine. Just a bit tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t believe her, but I didn&#39;t push. Something had been bothering her all day, but she wouldn&#39;t tell me what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Bianca storming out of the hall, her face a mask of fury. Jenny followed closely behind her, whispering something that only seemed to anger Bianca more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What now?&#34; I muttered under my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Lia again. She was staring down at her plate, absentmindedly pushing food around with her fork. Across the room, Alina sat alone, a smug smile on her face as if she knew a secret the rest of us didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me,&#34; I said, rising from my seat. Lia barely acknowledged me, still lost in her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way toward the doors, following the path Bianca and Jenny had taken. The hallway was empty, but the faint sound of voices reached my ears. I focused, letting my heightened wolf senses guide me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their voices became clearer as I approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should have gotten rid of Lia when we had the chance,&#34; Bianca hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now she&#39;s married,&#34; Jenny replied, her tone laced with frustration. &#34;And there&#39;s nothing we can do about it. Not to mention that we have a murderer on our tail. This is spiraling out of control!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath caught. A murderer? What were they talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit me like a punch to the gut. They had been plotting something against Lia all along, and now it seemed their plans were unraveling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to leave, my mind racing. I had to warn Lia. But before I could take a step, a sharp pain exploded in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked down, shocked to see the glint of a blade protruding from my ribs. Blood poured from the wound, staining my shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasping, I turned to face my attacker. A masked figure stood before me, their eyes cold and calculating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-why?&#34; I choked out, my voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure said nothing, pulling the knife free with a sickening sound. I staggered, clutching my chest as the world around me blurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Footsteps echoed in the distance, but my vision was fading fast. The last thing I saw was the masked figure disappearing into the shadows, leaving me alone in the hallway, drowning in my own blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn had been gone for too long. At first, I dismissed it as him taking a moment to himself-it wasn&#39;t unusual for him to step away from the chaos of a crowded event. But as the minutes dragged on, unease began to creep in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed my glass aside and stood up, ignoring the curious glances thrown my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; one of the guests asked, but I waved them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just checking on Finn,&#34; I said curtly, already moving toward the doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air outside was crisp, the moon casting an eerie glow over the surrounding grounds. I called Finn&#39;s name, my voice firm but tinged with growing worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart started pounding harder as I ventured farther away from the reception. Every step seemed to amplify the tension curling in my stomach. Something was wrong-I could feel it in my bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a muffled scream pierced the quiet night. My instincts kicked in, and I broke into a run, following the sound. My heels clicked against the stone pathway, but I barely noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finn!&#34; I shouted, my voice now frantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rounded a corner and froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, lying on the ground, was Finn. Blood soaked his shirt, pooling around him. Bianca and Jenny stood nearby, their faces pale and panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell have you done to him?&#34; I snarled, my voice trembling with rage as I rushed to Finn&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca raised her hands defensively. &#34;We didn&#39;t do anything! We found him like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded fervently. &#34;She&#39;s telling the truth. We just got here and saw him like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored them, dropping to my knees beside Finn. His breathing was shallow, his face pale. My heart clenched at the sight of him so vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lying,&#34; I spat, glaring up at them. &#34;You were planning something, weren&#39;t you? Against Lia? And now this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca stepped back, shaking her head. &#34;We swear, Alina. We didn&#39;t touch him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked down at Finn, brushing a stray lock of hair from his face. My hands trembled as I fought to steady my breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If he dies,&#34; I said coldly, my gaze snapping back to them, &#34;you&#39;re both dead. Now, help me get him back to his room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny hesitated but eventually nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll call the sentinels,&#34; she murmured, pulling out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca and I carefully lifted Finn&#39;s limp form. His blood smeared on my hands, warm and sticky, but I didn&#39;t care. My mind was racing, a thousand questions and accusations swirling through my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reached Finn&#39;s room, the sentinels following close behind to help lay him down on the bed. His breathing remained faint, and every shallow rise and fall of his chest made my stomach twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get a doctor,&#34; I said sharply, turning to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could step out, Lia appeared in the doorway, her face etched with confusion and concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; she asked, her voice trembling. Her gaze flickered to Finn&#39;s pale face, then to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t contain the rage bubbling inside me. My eyes narrowed, and I stepped closer to her, my voice low and venomous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Finn doesn&#39;t make it out of this alive,&#34; I said, my words cutting through the tension like a blade, &#34;get ready to die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s eyes widened, and for a moment, she looked like she wanted to say something. But I didn&#39;t wait for her response. I stormed past her, my mind already focused on finding a doctor and getting answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because someone would pay for this-if not Bianca or Jenny, then whoever else had dared to harm my brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>134</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chaos outside was deafening. Shouts echoed through the halls, and the tension in the air was so thick it felt like I could cut it with a knife. Finn&#39;s injury had thrown the entire pack into disarray, and the sight of Alina&#39;s cold, accusing eyes earlier kept replaying in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to move, my feet carrying me to Benedicta, who stood near the staircase, trying to make sense of the chaos. She turned the moment she saw me, her face a mix of worry and determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benedicta,&#34; I whispered, my voice shaking. &#34;I need to talk to you. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, I grabbed her hand and pulled her toward my bedroom. I shut the door behind us and locked it, leaning against it as I tried to steady my racing heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is bad,&#34; I muttered, pacing the room. &#34;This is really bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta watched me with a calmness I envied. &#34;Take a breath, Lia,&#34; she said gently. &#34;Tell me what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped pacing and faced her. &#34;Alina she&#39;s going to blame me. I know it. She as much as said it downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta&#39;s brows knitted together. &#34;She said that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, wrapping my arms around myself. &#34;She told me to &#39;get ready to die&#39; if Finn doesn&#39;t make it. And now the whole pack is in chaos, and I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I broke off as my phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out with trembling hands and saw Luca&#39;s name on the screen. Relief flooded through me as I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca,&#34; I said, trying to keep my voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; he asked immediately. His voice was calm but laced with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sank onto the edge of the bed, my free hand gripping the bedsheet. &#34;It&#39;s Finn,&#34; I said, my words tumbling out in a rush. &#34;Someone stabbed him. He&#39;s he&#39;s alive, but barely. And Alina is going to put the blame on me. She&#39;s already-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; Luca interrupted, his voice firm. &#34;Calm down. Just tell me everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a shaky breath and recounted what had happened, from finding Finn injured to Alina&#39;s cold threats. When I finished, there was silence on the other end of the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve heard something,&#34; he said finally. &#34;I just got the news that Alpha Dean might be in town.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean?&#34; I repeated my voice barely above a whisper. My stomach twisted at the mention of Luca&#39;s brother. &#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he admitted. &#34;There haven&#39;t been any confirmed sightings, but there are whispers. If he&#39;s here, he&#39;s keeping a low profile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, my mind racing. &#34;Do you think he did this? Do you think Dean stabbed Finn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s possible,&#34; Luca said, his tone grim. &#34;Dean has always had his own agenda. And if he&#39;s involved, this is just the beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank at his words. &#34;What do we do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now, you need to stay calm and stay safe,&#34; he said. &#34;Don&#39;t confront Alina or anyone else. Let them speculate all they want, but don&#39;t give them any reason to turn their suspicions into accusations. I&#39;ll handle things on my end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, even though he couldn&#39;t see me. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Lia,&#34; he added, his voice softening, &#34;don&#39;t lose hope. We&#39;ll figure this out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Luca,&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call ended, I sat there for a moment, staring at the phone in my hand. The weight of everything felt crushing, but I couldn&#39;t afford to fall apart now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta sat beside me, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder. &#34;What did he say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told her about Dean and Luca&#39;s suspicions. Her expression darkened, but she didn&#39;t let the worry show for long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; she said firmly, &#34;you need to trust that everything will fall into place. Luca is right. Don&#39;t confront anyone. Just focus on staying strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her, searching for reassurance in her steady gaze. &#34;But what if Alina&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She won&#39;t,&#34; Benedicta said, cutting me off. &#34;Because we won&#39;t let her. You&#39;re not alone in this, Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were a small comfort, but the dread in my chest refused to dissipate. As Benedicta helped me calm down and began going over plans to ensure my safety, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that things were about to get worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if Dean was really here, then chaos was only just beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stormed into my bedroom, slamming the door behind me. My heart pounded as I headed straight for the closet, throwing the door open. There he was, seated on a small stool like he had all the time in the world, his black cloak draped over his shoulders and a smug grin playing on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean,&#34; I said sharply, stepping inside and closing the closet door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His piercing eyes lifted to meet mine, his grin widening. &#34;Ah, sister dear,&#34; he said mockingly, &#34;to what do I owe the pleasure of this late-night visit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I folded my arms, glaring at him. &#34;We need to talk. Finn&#39;s been attacked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grin faltered for a moment, replaced by a curious tilt of his head. &#34;Oh? And how is the great Alpha Finn faring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s alive,&#34; I snapped, my voice trembling with frustration. &#34;But barely. He&#39;s unconscious, and no one knows who&#39;s responsible. I came here because I need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean leaned back, his expression unreadable. &#34;My condolences,&#34; he said with a feigned solemnity that made my blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step forward, clenching my fists. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare,&#34; I hissed. &#34;My brother is not dead, and he won&#39;t be. I need you to use your connections, your resources, whatever it takes to find out who did this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Dean said nothing. Then he stood, towering over me, his cloak brushing the floor. &#34;And why, dear sister, should I involve myself in this pack drama? What&#39;s in it for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, pushing down my fear. &#34;Because if Finn dies, this pack will fall apart. And if it falls apart, your little plans for Lia will crumble with it. You said it yourself-you need this pack stable for your schemes to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grin returned, sharp and predatory. &#34;Ah, so you do listen.&#34; He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. &#34;Very well, Alina. I&#39;ll help you find this mystery culprit. But I expect something in return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything,&#34; I said quickly, desperation seeping into my tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; he said, his grin widening. &#34;Now, about Lia&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut him off, shaking my head. &#34;You can&#39;t take her. Not now. This attack changes everything. If you try to abduct her now, it will only draw suspicion. You&#39;ll have to wait for a better opportunity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly, but he didn&#39;t argue. Instead, he stepped back, his grin fading into a thoughtful expression. &#34;Fine,&#34; he said after a moment. &#34;I&#39;ll wait. But don&#39;t keep me waiting too long, Alina. My patience is not infinite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and sat back down, dismissing me with a wave of his hand. I took a deep breath, my hands trembling as I opened the closet door and stepped back into my bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked out into the hallway, I spotted Bianca and Jenny skulking near Finn&#39;s bedroom door. My blood boiled at the sight of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; I snapped, striding toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They turned to face me, their expressions a mixture of surprise and annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just wanted to check on him,&#34; Bianca said, her tone overly sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play innocent with me,&#34; I hissed, stepping closer. &#34;I know what you two are up to. You&#39;ve been scheming against Lia since the beginning, and now my brother is lying unconscious because of your incompetence. Did you plan to kill her and end up harming him instead? Or was this just collateral damage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny&#39;s eyes widened, and she took a step back, but Bianca held her ground, her jaw tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We had nothing to do with this,&#34; Bianca said, her voice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t believe you,&#34; I shot back. &#34;You can deny it all you want, but I&#39;ll get to the truth. And if I find out you&#39;re behind this, I swear I&#39;ll make you pay. Both of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny grabbed Bianca&#39;s arm, pulling her back. &#34;Come on, let&#39;s go,&#34; she muttered, clearly shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca hesitated, glaring at me, but eventually allowed Jenny to lead her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched them disappear down the hallway, my hands clenched into fists. I turned back toward Finn&#39;s room, taking a deep breath to steady myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack was in chaos, my brother&#39;s life hung by a thread, and danger lurked around every corner. But one thing was clear-I wouldn&#39;t rest until I uncovered the truth. And when I did, whoever was responsible would regret crossing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>135</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air was suffocating. Every corner of the pack house buzzed with whispers of Finn&#39;s attack, and I couldn&#39;t move without feeling a dozen eyes boring into my back. Jenny and I had barely made it out of that hallway alive after Alina&#39;s confrontation. I wasn&#39;t scared of her, but her words stuck in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did we mess up?&#34; Jenny asked nervously as we entered my room and closed the door behind us. She sat on the edge of the bed, her hands twisting anxiously in her lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned against the dresser, crossing my arms. &#34;No,&#34; I said firmly, though the tightness in my chest said otherwise. &#34;We&#39;ve been careful. We didn&#39;t stab Finn. Someone else did. Alina&#39;s just lashing out because she&#39;s desperate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what if she&#39;s right?&#34; Jenny&#39;s voice cracked. &#34;What if whoever stabbed Finn was aiming for Lia? What if we&#39;re next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her, my glare silencing her panicked rambling. &#34;We are not next. Whoever did this has no reason to come after us unless you do something stupid like freak out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded but didn&#39;t look convinced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced the room, my mind racing. This wasn&#39;t how things were supposed to go. Lia was the target, not Finn. Now everything was upside down, and the pack was on edge. If Alina decided to dig too deep, she could uncover secrets that would destroy us both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed on the dresser, pulling me out of my thoughts. I grabbed it, glancing at the screen. It was a message from my investigator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I found something. Sending it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, a video came through. My heart pounded as I opened it, the screen filling with grainy security footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, it was hard to make out, but then I saw him. Luca. He was entering Lex&#39;s house the night everything went to hell. A slow smile spread across my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gotcha,&#34; I muttered under my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Jenny asked, standing to peer over my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly locked my phone and shoved it into my pocket. &#34;Nothing. Just some pack gossip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny frowned but didn&#39;t press further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen,&#34; I said, shifting the conversation. &#34;We need to be smart about this. Finn&#39;s attack changes things, but it doesn&#39;t change our goal. Lia is still a problem, and we can&#39;t let her get comfortable. She&#39;s too close to Luca, and if those two start working together, they&#39;ll uncover everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what do we do now?&#34; Jenny asked, her voice shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her a cold smile. &#34;We wait. Whoever attacked Finn is either an ally or an enemy we haven&#39;t identified yet. Either way, they&#39;ve given us an opportunity. The pack is distracted, and Alina&#39;s too focused on revenge to see what&#39;s right in front of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny still looked unsure, but she nodded. &#34;Okay. What about Alina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed dryly. &#34;Alina&#39;s predictable. She&#39;ll make threats and stomp around like she owns the place, but she won&#39;t act without proof. All we have to do is stay one step ahead of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny sighed, looking slightly more relaxed. &#34;I hope you&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am,&#34; I said confidently. &#34;Now go. I need to make a few calls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny hesitated, but eventually nodded and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the door clicked shut, I pulled out my phone and opened the video again. I watched it closely this time, noting every detail. Luca wasn&#39;t just at Lex&#39;s house; he looked agitated, almost frantic. He knew something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made a quick call to my investigator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who else has seen this?&#34; I demanded the moment he picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one,&#34; he replied. &#34;You said to send it to you first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Keep it that way. I&#39;ll let you know if I need anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung up and leaned against the dresser, my mind racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s involvement complicated things, but it also gave me leverage. If he was connected to Lex&#39;s death, then I had a weapon I could use against him and Lia. But I had to be careful. If I played this wrong, it could blow up in my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I considered my next move, the door creaked open, and Jenny peeked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What now?&#34; I snapped, irritated by the interruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a meeting in the main hall,&#34; she said nervously. &#34;Alina called it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;Of course, she did. Fine, let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny and I made our way to the hall, where the pack had already gathered. Alina stood at the front, her eyes blazing with anger and determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care what it takes,&#34; she was saying as we entered. &#34;Whoever did this to my brother will pay. And if anyone here is hiding something, now is the time to come forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes swept over the crowd, lingering on me for a moment before moving on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met her gaze with a smirk, daring her to say something. She didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the meeting continued, I felt my confidence returning. Alina could bluster all she wanted, but she didn&#39;t have proof. And as long as I had that video, I held the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the meeting ended, I slipped away, my mind already planning my next move. Lia and Luca thought they were safe, but they had no idea what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled to myself as I headed back to my room. The game was far from over, and I intended to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hallways felt eerily quiet as I made my way to Finn&#39;s room. The entire pack house was in chaos earlier, but now it seemed like the air itself was holding its breath. My steps faltered as I neared the door, dread pooling in my stomach. Finn was injured, and no one had any answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed the door open gently and stepped inside. The room was dim, lit only by the soft glow of a bedside lamp. Finn lay on the bed, his face pale and motionless, bandages wrapped around his chest. Seeing him like this sent a pang through my heart. This wasn&#39;t the strong, commanding Finn I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I approached the bed and stood by his side, my fingers hesitating over his hand before finally resting on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finn&#34; I whispered though I knew he couldn&#39;t hear me. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you. I wish I could fix it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guilt weighed heavy on me. If it weren&#39;t for me, he wouldn&#39;t be in this state. This attack was meant for me-I was sure of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open behind me, and I turned to see Alina stride in, her expression a mix of anger and suspicion. She stopped a few feet away, crossing her arms over her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; she demanded, her tone icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to check on him,&#34; I said quietly, trying to keep my voice calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed. &#34;You&#39;ve done enough damage already. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time you leave my brother alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words stung, but I forced myself to hold my ground. &#34;I didn&#39;t hurt Finn, Alina. I care about him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Care?&#34; she repeated, her voice dripping with sarcasm. &#34;If you cared, he wouldn&#39;t be lying there, fighting for his life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not fair,&#34; I snapped, the weight of her accusations finally breaking my resolve. &#34;I didn&#39;t stab him. I would never hurt him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you?&#34; She took a step closer, her eyes narrowing. &#34;Because ever since you came into our lives, everything has been chaos. My brother&#39;s been distracted, this pack is falling apart, and now he&#39;s on the brink of death. Tell me, Lia, how exactly are you not to blame?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists, anger, and frustration bubbling inside me. &#34;I didn&#39;t ask for any of this! Do you think I want to be hunted? Do you think I want people trying to kill me? I&#39;m as much a victim in this as Finn is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victim?&#34; Alina laughed bitterly. &#34;You&#39;re not a victim, Lia. You&#39;re a curse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit harder than I expected, and for a moment, I couldn&#39;t find a response. The silence between us was thick, broken only by the soft sound of Finn&#39;s breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I spoke, my voice quieter but firm. &#34;You can blame me all you want, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that someone out there is targeting this pack. You&#39;re wasting time pointing fingers when we should be finding out who&#39;s responsible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s eyes flashed with anger, but she didn&#39;t immediately respond. Instead, she turned her attention to Finn, her expression softening slightly as she looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll find out who did this,&#34; she said, her voice lower but still filled with determination. &#34;And when I do, they&#39;ll pay. But if I find out you had anything to do with it, Lia you&#39;ll regret ever stepping foot in this pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met her gaze, refusing to back down. &#34;I didn&#39;t hurt him, Alina. And I&#39;m not going anywhere until I know he&#39;s safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, we stared at each other, neither willing to back down. Then she turned on her heel and stormed out of the room, leaving me alone with Finn once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sank into the chair beside his bed, my hands trembling as I gripped the armrests. The argument with Alina had rattled me, but it also strengthened my resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever was behind this attack wasn&#39;t going to win. Not if I had anything to say about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>136</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Finn one last time as he lay still on the bed, his breathing shallow but steady. My heart ached to see him like this. I wanted to stay, to keep watching over him, but Alina&#39;s accusations still lingered in my mind, making the air in the room feel suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh, I turned to leave. Just as I reached the door, a flicker of movement caught my eye. The curtains by the window swayed gently, though there was no breeze. My heart skipped a beat, and I froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34; I called out, my voice firmer than I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped closer, peering into the shadows near the window. &#34;I said, who&#39;s there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still no response. I waited for a few tense moments, but nothing moved again. My mind began to race with possibilities. Was it just my imagination? Or was someone really there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my head, I decided not to let paranoia take over. &#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; I muttered to myself, though the uneasy feeling didn&#39;t quite leave me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped out of the room and made my way back to my bedroom. The hallways felt colder than usual, or maybe it was just my nerves playing tricks on me. When I pushed open the door to my room, I found Benedicta already asleep on the bed, her steady breathing a calming rhythm against the chaos in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, I locked the door behind me, ensuring it was secure before sitting down on the edge of the bed. My thoughts were a mess, but one thing was clear-I needed answers. Without hesitation, I picked up my phone and dialed Luca&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered after a few rings, his voice low and cautious. &#34;Lia, is everything okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I admitted, running a hand through my hair. &#34;It&#39;s not. I&#39;m scared, Luca. Finn&#39;s still unconscious, Alina is convinced I&#39;m to blame, and now&#34; I paused, unsure if I should mention the moving curtains. &#34;Now I feel like I&#39;m being watched.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s tone sharpened. &#34;Watched? What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated. &#34;It&#39;s probably nothing, but I thought I saw something in Finn&#39;s room. The curtains moved, but there was no one there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was silent for a moment, then said, &#34;You&#39;re right to be cautious. This isn&#39;t just about Finn&#39;s attack. My investigation is pointing to something bigger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My grip on the phone tightened. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems like the same person who killed Lex might be behind Finn&#39;s shooting,&#34; Luca explained. &#34;Whoever it is, they&#39;re not just targeting random people. They know about Bianca, Jenny, you-and maybe more. They&#39;ve been watching all of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation sent chills down my spine. &#34;But why? What do they want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to figure out,&#34; he said, his frustration evident. &#34;Think, Lia. Is there anyone you&#39;ve had a recent argument with? Someone who might have a reason to hurt you or the people around you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t have to think long. One name came to mind instantly. &#34;Alina,&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alina?&#34; he repeated, his tone growing sharper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s Finn&#39;s sister,&#34; I explained. &#34;She&#39;s never liked me, and today she made it clear she blames me for everything. She said I was a curse and even threatened me if Finn doesn&#39;t recover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca was silent for a moment before letting out a low growl. &#34;I need to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? What is it?&#34; I asked, panic creeping into my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ve just found a suspect,&#34; he said firmly. &#34;If Alina&#39;s involved, I need to confirm it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, wait-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he had already hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the phone in disbelief, my heart racing. Could Alina really be behind all of this? It seemed unthinkable, but then again, she had always been cold toward me. She&#39;d made it clear that she didn&#39;t want me in Finn&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back against the headboard, trying to calm my breathing. Benedicta stirred slightly in her sleep but didn&#39;t wake. The room felt heavy, the shadows on the walls seeming to stretch and shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Luca was right, and Alina was somehow involved, what did that mean for me? For Finn? For everyone else in the pack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed a hand to my chest, willing my racing heart to slow. Luca would find answers-I trusted him. But the uneasy feeling in my gut told me that things were far from over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if Alina really was the enemy, I had no idea how I was going to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Dean&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dim lighting of the room barely illuminated the sleeping figure of Finn. From his hiding place in the shadows, I watched him, the steady beeping of the machines keeping him alive grating on my nerves. A wolf-like him-a supposed alpha-reduced to this? Pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was laughable that this weakling thought he could protect someone like Lia. My Lia. He didn&#39;t deserve her, and soon enough, he wouldn&#39;t even have the chance to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped out from the corner where I had been concealed, my boots making no sound against the floor. As I approached Finn&#39;s bed, the faint scent of antiseptic and weakness filled the air. The sight of him, pale and defenseless, filled me with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve always been in the way, Finn,&#34; I murmured, standing over him. My voice was low, but it carried the weight of my hatred. &#34;From the moment Lia entered your life, you&#39;ve been nothing but a barrier. You thought you could marry her, make her yours? Foolish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned closer, my lips curling into a sneer. &#34;She&#39;s mine. She&#39;s always been mine. And no one, not even you, will take her from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand moved to the pillow resting on the sofa beside the bed. Slowly, I picked it up, feeling the weight of it in my hands. I glanced at Finn one last time, his face peaceful in unconsciousness. It almost felt too easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached over and turned off the machine providing him with oxygen, the soft hiss of air coming to a halt. The room fell into a tense silence, broken only by the faint hum of the heart monitor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; I said mockingly, pressing the pillow firmly over his face. &#34;This won&#39;t take long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn stirred weakly, his body instinctively struggling against the lack of air. His movements were feeble and uncoordinated, and it only made me press harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were never strong enough to be alpha,&#34; I snarled, leaning more of my weight onto the pillow. &#34;And you&#39;ll never be strong enough to keep her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heart monitor&#39;s beeping quickened for a moment before it began to slow, each interval growing longer and longer. Finn&#39;s struggles ceased, his body falling still beneath my hands. The monitor emitted a long, steady tone-a flatline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed there for a moment, letting the silence sink in, the weight of my actions settling comfortably in my chest. A dark smile spread across my face as I removed the pillow and stepped back, surveying my work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s one obstacle out of the way,&#34; I said softly, almost to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I adjusted the pillow back on the sofa, ensuring it looked undisturbed, and glanced around the room to confirm there were no signs of struggle. Everything was as it should be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked toward the door, I couldn&#39;t help but smile. Lia would be mine. It was only a matter of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would stand in my way-not Finn, not Alina, not even Luca. This was just the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>137</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The piercing scream of a maid echoed through the pack house, jolting me from my thoughts. My heart leaped into my throat, and I instinctively rushed toward the source of the commotion. The hallway was alive with murmurs, tension thick in the air as I approached Finn&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; I demanded, pushing past a group of maids clustered near the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight before me stole the breath from my lungs. Finn lay still on his bed, his chest unmoving. The monitor that had been beeping steadily earlier now emitted a deafening flatline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I shouted, rushing to his side. My hands shook as I pressed them against his lifeless form as if my touch alone could bring him back. &#34;Finn! Wake up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the maids stepped forward hesitantly, tears streaming down her face. &#34;H-he&#39;s gone, Miss Alina. We... we found him like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her, my voice trembling with fury and disbelief. &#34;Gone? What do you mean gone? He was stable just a few hours ago!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another maid whispered, &#34;His oxygen machine was off. It looks like someone turned it off deliberately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit me like a ton of bricks. Someone had done this. Someone had killed my brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the sound of hurried footsteps reached my ears. I turned to see Lia entering the room, her face pale with confusion and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You,&#34; I spat, my voice laced with venom as I pointed an accusing finger at her. &#34;You did this, didn&#39;t you? You couldn&#39;t wait to get rid of him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s eyes widened in shock. &#34;What? No, I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare deny it!&#34; I screamed, cutting her off. &#34;You&#39;ve been nothing but trouble since the moment you stepped foot in this house. My brother trusted you, and you repaid him with betrayal. You&#39;re nothing but a murderer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s voice cracked as she tried to defend herself. &#34;Alina, I didn&#39;t do this! I loved Finn-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare say his name!&#34; I roared. &#34;If it weren&#39;t for you, he&#39;d still be alive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the room was suffocating, the maids whispering among themselves as they watched the confrontation unfold. Before Lia could respond, a sentinel entered the room, bowing slightly before addressing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The elders have summoned an emergency meeting in the council chamber,&#34; he said gravely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened, my anger simmering just beneath the surface. &#34;Good. Maybe they&#39;ll finally do something about her,&#34; I said, casting one last glare at Lia before storming out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council chamber was already filled with murmuring voices when I arrived. The elders, their faces etched with concern, sat at the head of the table, their presence commanding the room&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Lia entered, followed closely by Bianca and Jenny. The sight of them made my blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; I shouted, pointing at Bianca and Jenny as they tried to slink into the room unnoticed. &#34;What are you even doing here? Do you think I don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve been up to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca raised an eyebrow, feigning innocence. &#34;Alina, what are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play dumb with me!&#34; I snapped. &#34;You&#39;ve been scheming against Lia since the beginning. And now, Finn is dead! Did you think I wouldn&#39;t put the pieces together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny scoffed, crossing her arms over her chest. &#34;You&#39;re letting your emotions cloud your judgment, Alina. We had nothing to do with this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liar!&#34; I screamed, slamming my hands down on the table. &#34;You&#39;ve been plotting to get rid of her for weeks. Maybe you were aiming for Lia and got Finn instead, or maybe you wanted them both gone. Either way, I won&#39;t rest until I find out the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elders exchanged wary glances, one of them raising a hand to calm the room. &#34;Alina, we understand your grief, but accusations without proof will not help us resolve this situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Proof?&#34; I laughed bitterly. &#34;You want proof? Look no further than these two snakes,&#34; I said, pointing at Bianca and Jenny. &#34;They&#39;ve been meddling in everything from the start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca glared at me, her composure slipping. &#34;Be careful with your words, Alina. You don&#39;t want to make enemies you can&#39;t handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, trust me,&#34; I shot back. &#34;You&#39;ve been my enemy for a long time. And when I find out exactly what role you played in my brother&#39;s death, you&#39;ll regret ever stepping foot in this pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elders intervened, their voices firm as they called for order in the room. But my fury couldn&#39;t be contained. I didn&#39;t trust Lia. I didn&#39;t trust Bianca or Jenny. And until I uncovered the truth, none of them were safe from my wrath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the meeting continued, I vowed to myself that I would get justice for Finn, no matter the cost. Even if it meant tearing this entire pack apart to find the person responsible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands trembled as I dialed Luca&#39;s number, pacing back and forth in my room. The packed house was in chaos, and I could feel the weight of the accusations hurled at me earlier by Alina. Finn&#39;s death had turned everything upside down, and now I was the target of everyone&#39;s anger and suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, thank God you picked up,&#34; I said the moment he answered, my voice quivering with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened, Lia?&#34; he asked, his tone steady but concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly recounted everything-the maid&#39;s scream, Finn&#39;s death, Alina&#39;s accusations, and the looming meeting with the elders. My voice cracked as I reached the part where Alina had called me a murderer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s blaming me, Luca. She thinks I killed Finn,&#34; I said, struggling to hold back my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia, listen to me,&#34; Luca said firmly, his voice a calming presence amid the chaos. &#34;I need you to stay put. Don&#39;t confront anyone or make any rash decisions. This isn&#39;t the time to act on emotion. I&#39;ll handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, Luca-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, Lia,&#34; he interrupted. &#34;I&#39;ll get to the bottom of this. For now, just stay where you are, and don&#39;t let anyone provoke you. You&#39;re not alone in this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, even though he couldn&#39;t see me. &#34;Okay. Please, just hurry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; he promised before the line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to find Benedicta sitting on the edge of my bed, her expression one of quiet determination. She had been with me since the chaos erupted, a steadfast presence that kept me from completely unraveling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca&#39;s right,&#34; she said softly, taking my hand. &#34;You need to stay calm. Alina&#39;s grief is clouding her judgment, but the truth will come out eventually. You&#39;re innocent, Lia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were meant to comfort me, but they barely made a dent in the storm of emotions raging inside me. Before I could respond, the door to my room slammed open, and Bianca and Jenny stormed in, their faces twisted with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you?&#34; Bianca seethed, her voice loud and grating. &#34;How dare you come into this pack and destroy everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been nothing but trouble since the moment you arrived,&#34; Jenny added, her tone dripping with disdain. &#34;And now Finn is dead. Do you think we&#39;re going to let you get away with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped back, the venom in their words hitting me like a slap. &#34;I didn&#39;t do anything!&#34; I snapped, my voice rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca scoffed, stepping closer. &#34;Don&#39;t play innocent, Lia. We know what you&#39;re capable of. You&#39;ve been a thorn in everyone&#39;s side, and now you&#39;ve gone too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their accusations ignited a fire inside me, and I clenched my fists at my sides. &#34;You want to talk about going too far?&#34; I said, my voice shaking with fury. &#34;I know what you&#39;ve been up to. I know you planned to kill me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both women froze, their eyes widening in shock. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34; Jenny asked, her voice quieter now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play dumb,&#34; I spat. &#34;I overheard you two talking. You wanted me out of the way, and now Finn is dead because of your schemes. I&#39;ve kept quiet for too long, but not anymore. I&#39;m going to the elders, and I&#39;m telling them everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed across Bianca&#39;s face, but she quickly masked it with anger. &#34;You don&#39;t have any proof,&#34; she said, her voice trembling slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need proof,&#34; I shot back. &#34;The elders will investigate, and when they find out the truth, you&#39;ll pay for what you&#39;ve done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta stepped forward, placing a steadying hand on my arm. &#34;That&#39;s enough, Lia,&#34; she said gently. &#34;Don&#39;t let them bait you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, realizing she was right. Bianca and Jenny weren&#39;t worth losing my composure over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve said what I needed to say,&#34; I told them, my voice calmer now but no less resolute. &#34;You can leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, neither of them moved their faces a mixture of anger and fear. Then, without another word, they turned and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta sighed, giving my hand a reassuring squeeze. &#34;You did the right thing, standing up to them. But now you need to be prepared for whatever comes next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, my resolve hardening. &#34;I won&#39;t let them pin this on me, Benedicta. I didn&#39;t kill Finn, and I won&#39;t let them ruin my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her by my side, I felt a flicker of hope amid the chaos. The road ahead would be treacherous, but I was determined to fight for the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>138</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air in the pack house was suffocating, laden with tension so thick it was nearly tangible. Finn&#39;s death had cast a dark shadow over everything, and it was a matter of time before accusations and suspicions boiled over. My hands trembled as I paced my room, my mind racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t part of the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny sat on the bed, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, her face pale but defiant. &#34;Bianca, this is getting out of hand. Lia knows something. She practically accused us in front of Benedicta.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whirled on her, my voice sharp. &#34;And what exactly do you think we should do about it? Go to the elders and confess? Because that&#39;s what your panicking sounds like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny flinched, her composure cracking. &#34;No, but if Alina starts digging, we&#39;re finished. She&#39;s furious. She&#39;ll turn over every stone to find out who killed Finn, and when she does, we&#39;ll be the first ones she looks at.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my jaw, staring out the window. The moonlight illuminated the pack grounds, tranquil and deceptive. Inside, chaos brewed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her look,&#34; I said finally, my voice cold. &#34;Let her throw her tantrums and hurl accusations. We didn&#39;t kill Finn, and she won&#39;t find anything linking us to his death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; I snapped, my patience fraying. &#34;We aimed for Lia, not Finn. And now Finn&#39;s dead. That complicates things, yes, but it doesn&#39;t mean we fold. We stick to the story, keep our heads down, and let this storm blow over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny hesitated, uncertainty written all over her face. &#34;And what if it doesn&#39;t blow over? What if Alina gets to the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her, my eyes narrowing. &#34;Then we make sure she doesn&#39;t. We&#39;ve come too far to let everything unravel now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed was heavy, but Jenny nodded reluctantly. I knew she was scared. Hell, I was too. But fear was a luxury I couldn&#39;t afford. Not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crackle of the fire in the library offered no comfort as I sat across from Dean. His face was a mask of quiet fury, his sharp features illuminated by the flickering flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My brother is dead,&#34; I said, breaking the silence, my voice heavy with barely contained rage. &#34;And no one is telling me anything. Not the elders, not the sentinels-no one. It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to sweep this under the rug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean leaned forward, his intense gaze locking onto mine. &#34;They won&#39;t. Not if we don&#39;t let them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms. &#34;I can&#39;t believe this is happening. Finn... he was supposed to recover. He was supposed to lead this pack again. And now...&#34; My voice broke, and I looked away, swallowing the lump in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean reached out, his hand covering mine. &#34;I know how much he meant to you, Alina. We&#39;ll find out who did this. Whoever they are, they won&#39;t get away with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, grateful for his steady presence. &#34;I need your help, Dean. I can&#39;t do this alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; he said firmly. &#34;But we need to be smart about this. Whoever killed Finn isn&#39;t going to just confess. They&#39;ll cover their tracks, and we&#39;ll need to dig deep to uncover the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat back, trying to piece everything together. &#34;The maids said his oxygen was turned off. That means whoever did it was in the room. They had to be someone who could get close to him without raising suspicion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean frowned, his mind clearly working through the possibilities. &#34;You think it was someone from the pack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, the thought twisting my stomach. &#34;I don&#39;t want to believe it, but who else could it be? An outsider wouldn&#39;t have had the opportunity. Someone here killed my brother, and they need to pay for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean nodded slowly. &#34;Then we start with the obvious suspects. Who would have had something to gain from Finn&#39;s death?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; I said immediately, bitterness lacing my words. &#34;She&#39;s been nothing but a thorn in our side. She was in the room right after it happened, and she&#39;s been causing problems since the moment she arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean considered this, but his expression remained neutral. &#34;Lia has been a source of tension, yes. But killing Finn? That&#39;s a bold move, even for her. We can&#39;t let personal feelings cloud our judgment, Alina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bristled, but he was right. As much as I despised Lia, we needed evidence, not just suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca and Jenny,&#34; I said after a moment. &#34;They&#39;ve been scheming for weeks. They hated Lia, and they might have seen Finn as collateral damage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;If they&#39;re involved, we&#39;ll find out. But we&#39;ll need to tread carefully. Accusing them outright could backfire. They&#39;ll close ranks if they feel threatened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we don&#39;t accuse them,&#34; I said, a plan forming in my mind. &#34;We watch them. We listen. If they&#39;re guilty, they&#39;ll slip up eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s lips curved into a faint smile. &#34;Now you&#39;re thinking like a leader.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the gravity of the situation, his words warmed me. Finn had always been the leader, the one everyone looked to for guidance. Now, it was up to me to step into that role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do we start?&#34; I asked determination, hardening my resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean leaned back, his eyes glinting with a mix of determination and something darker. &#34;We start by making them think we&#39;re not looking. Let them believe they&#39;ve gotten away with it. People get careless when they think the heat is off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, a grim smile forming on my lips. &#34;And when they slip, we&#39;ll be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air was palpable as I entered the pack&#39;s main hall. The elders were speaking in hushed tones, their faces etched with concern. The weight of their scrutiny was suffocating, but I kept my expression neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca,&#34; one of them said, gesturing for me to approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped forward, inclining my head respectfully. &#34;Elder Markus, how can I help you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sharp eyes bore into mine. &#34;There have been... troubling developments regarding Finn&#39;s death. The pack is in turmoil, and we need answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a look of concern onto my face. &#34;Of course, Elder. I&#39;ll do whatever I can to assist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Markus studied me for a moment before nodding. &#34;See that you do. The pack&#39;s stability depends on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and excused myself, my heart pounding as I left the hall. Jenny was waiting for me outside, her expression anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did they want?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing we didn&#39;t already expect,&#34; I said tightly. &#34;They&#39;re looking for answers, and they&#39;re watching everyone closely. We need to be careful, Jenny. One wrong move, and we&#39;re done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny swallowed hard, her fear evident. &#34;What if they find out, Bianca? What if they figure out that we-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They won&#39;t,&#34; I interrupted sharply. &#34;We didn&#39;t kill Finn. Let them investigate all they want. They&#39;ll find nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even as I said the words, doubt gnawed at me. Alina was relentless, and Dean&#39;s quiet intensity was unnerving. They wouldn&#39;t stop until they uncovered the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if that truth led back to us...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook the thought away, forcing myself to focus. I couldn&#39;t afford to let fear cloud my judgment. Not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We stick to the plan,&#34; I said firmly. &#34;No more mistakes. No more slip-ups. We see this through, no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded reluctantly, but I could see the cracks forming in her resolve. I just hoped those cracks wouldn&#39;t bring everything crashing down around us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean and I stood in Finn&#39;s room, the oppressive silence heavy with unspoken grief. The maids had cleaned up, but the lingering scent of antiseptic couldn&#39;t mask the memories of what had happened here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is where it started,&#34; I said quietly, my eyes scanning the room. &#34;Whoever killed Finn was in this room, Dean. They stood right here and...&#34; My voice faltered, and I clenched my fists. &#34;They took him from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. &#34;We&#39;ll find them, Alina. And when we do, they&#39;ll pay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, my jaw set with determination. &#34;They think they&#39;ve won. They think they&#39;ve gotten away with it. But they haven&#39;t. We&#39;ll make sure of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s eyes gleamed with fierce resolve. &#34;Together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we left the room, a sense of purpose settled over me. Finn&#39;s death wouldn&#39;t be in vain. I would uncover the truth, no matter what it took. And when I did, justice would be served.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>139</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dim glow of the moon seeped through my window, casting long, wavering shadows on the walls. The silence in the pack house was almost unnerving, a stark contrast to the turmoil in my mind. Finn&#39;s death haunted me relentlessly-his smile, his laugh, the way he always seemed to hold the pack together. Now he was gone, and we were left scrambling in the dark to uncover who had ripped him away from us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wouldn&#39;t rest until I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft knock on my door startled me. My heart raced as I got up cautiously. No one should have been awake at this hour. Opening the door, I was met with a familiar face-Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled him inside quickly, locking the door behind him. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t be here,&#34; I whispered sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean leaned against the wall, his face etched with exhaustion but his eyes burning with determination. &#34;I couldn&#39;t stay hidden any longer, Alina. We&#39;re running out of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, knowing he was right but unwilling to admit it aloud. Dean had been staying in one of the abandoned cabins on the outskirts of the territory, far from prying eyes. He was supposed to be safe there, invisible to the pack, but he&#39;d risked exposure to come here tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have you found?&#34; I asked, motioning for him to sit on the edge of my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered himself, running a hand through his hair. &#34;Not much, but enough to know that Bianca and Jenny are lying about something. They&#39;re always together, whispering, avoiding questions about that night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. &#34;Bianca&#39;s smart. She knows how to keep her tracks clean. If she&#39;s involved, she won&#39;t slip up easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees. &#34;Then we push harder. We need to get inside her head and make her paranoid. The guilt will eat away at her if she&#39;s hiding something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lump formed in my throat at the thought of manipulating someone like that, but Dean was right. This wasn&#39;t about playing nice; it was about finding the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Jenny?&#34; I asked. &#34;Do you think she&#39;s capable of&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Murder?&#34; Dean finished for me, his expression grim. &#34;No. But she might know something. Bianca&#39;s the leader-Jenny just follows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip, my mind churning. &#34;If we&#39;re going to confront them, we need solid evidence first. Otherwise, they&#39;ll just deny it, and we&#39;ll lose the element of surprise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean nodded. &#34;Agreed. I&#39;ll keep digging. In the meantime, stay close to them. Watch their movements, listen to what they&#39;re not saying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met his gaze, a surge of gratitude and determination swelling within me. &#34;Thank you, Dean. For being here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled faintly. &#34;For Finn, I&#39;d do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of the world seemed to press down on me as I wandered through the quiet halls of the pack house. Jenny was asleep-finally-after I&#39;d spent hours convincing her that everything would be fine. But even as I spoke those words to her, I wasn&#39;t sure I believed them myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d lied before, covered for mistakes, but this this was different. Finn&#39;s death wasn&#39;t something I could brush under the rug. Alina&#39;s eyes, sharp and accusing, were constantly on me, and Lia wasn&#39;t far behind. They could smell the fear, the guilt, no matter how hard I tried to hide it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the kitchen, I poured myself a glass of water and leaned against the counter. My reflection in the window stared back at me, pale and drawn. I hated what I&#39;d become-hated the lies, the deceit, the constant fear of being caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A creak behind me snapped me out of my thoughts. I turned sharply, my heart racing, but the kitchen was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get a grip,&#34; I muttered to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that someone was watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, I forced myself to act normal, even as my insides churned. Alina was in the dining room, her usual spot at the head of the table. She didn&#39;t look at me directly, but I could feel her scrutiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; I said casually, taking my seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning,&#34; she replied, her tone clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny joined a moment later, her movements stiff and awkward. I shot her a warning glance, silently willing her to pull it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,&#34; Alina began, her eyes flicking between us, &#34;have you two remembered anything useful about that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I said quickly. &#34;We&#39;ve already told you everything we know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. &#34;It was chaos. I can&#39;t remember much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina hummed thoughtfully, her gaze lingering on me a moment too long. &#34;Funny how everyone else seems to recall where they were, what they were doing. But you two your stories are always vague.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists under the table, forcing a calm smile. &#34;We&#39;ve been through this, Alina. We didn&#39;t see anything suspicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm,&#34; she said again, leaning back in her chair. &#34;Well, let me know if you suddenly remember anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension was unbearable, and I excused myself as soon as I could. Jenny followed, her face pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She knows,&#34; Jenny whispered as we stepped outside. &#34;Bianca, she knows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t,&#34; I snapped, more harshly than I intended. &#34;She&#39;s fishing for a reaction. Don&#39;t give her one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny nodded, but her fear was palpable. I needed to keep her calm, or she&#39;d unravel everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched Bianca and Jenny retreat, their fear as plain as day. Dean was right-they were hiding something. I just needed to figure out what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, I made my way to the forest, where Dean was waiting in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re cracking,&#34; I told him. &#34;Jenny&#39;s barely holding it together, and Bianca&#39;s doing everything she can to cover for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean nodded, his expression serious. &#34;Then we press harder. Let the pressure build until they can&#39;t take it anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, a pang of guilt tugging at me. &#34;And what if we&#39;re wrong? What if they&#39;re just scared because they think we&#39;ll blame them for something they didn&#39;t do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;Then we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it. But right now, they&#39;re our best lead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded reluctantly. &#34;What&#39;s our next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s eyes gleamed with determination. &#34;We follow them. Tonight, after everyone&#39;s asleep. If they&#39;re up to something, we&#39;ll catch them in the act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling of being watched. Every creak of the floorboards and every rustle of the wind set my nerves on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jenny had fallen asleep early, but I couldn&#39;t rest. Something about Alina&#39;s questions this morning had rattled me more than I wanted to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to sit still, I slipped out of my room and headed for the woods. The darkness was oppressive, but the cool air helped clear my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t notice the figure trailing me until it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out for a midnight stroll?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spun around, my heart pounding. Alina stood a few feet away, her arms crossed, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t sleep,&#34; I said quickly. &#34;What are you doing out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same,&#34; she said, stepping closer. &#34;Funny how we keep running into each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze was piercing, and I felt like she could see right through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, Alina?&#34; I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The truth,&#34; she said bluntly. &#34;About that night. About Finn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a laugh, even as my stomach churned. &#34;I already told you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop lying, Bianca,&#34; she snapped, her voice low but dangerous. &#34;I know you&#39;re hiding something, and I won&#39;t stop until I find out what it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath caught, but I managed to keep my composure. &#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped even closer, her eyes blazing. &#34;You can deny it all you want, but the truth always comes out. And when it does, I hope you&#39;re ready for the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held her gaze, refusing to back down, but inside, I was crumbling. If Alina kept digging, it was only a matter of time before she uncovered everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when she did, there&#39;d be no turning back.</p>
