                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A what!&#34; All of them ask at once. A good smile tugged at my face. Dean is the definition of shock and anger. Well, Lorenzo is quiet for the first time since I knew him. His mouth is slightly open, revealing his extent of surprise. Luca&#39;s eyes are wide in the face, and I think it is about to fall out of his eye socket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I burst into laughter. Dean narrows his eyes, and for some reason, the scene is very funny. I burst into laughter the second time, I laughed and laughed and laughed. I stopped to examine their faces and burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you joking?&#34; Luca asks. His voice is soft, almost like a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My smile widened. Luca&#39;s voice is never soft. It&#39;s always rough even in his vulnerable moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He asked you a question!&#34; The obnoxious twat called Lorenzo shouts. I roll my eyes. Seriously, why does he always have to be this annoying every time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia&#34; Dean growls. I smile. Last week he was trying to rape me and this week I am rendering him speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop smiling; the smile washes off my face in a second and is replaced with a blank, emotionless face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard me, Dean. I need a divorce. I am asking for a divorce. We are not even mates, so it&#39;s not going to affect you, &#34; I explain in a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should also tell him that if he does not do as I say I would tell the whole park the way he treats me or maybe ask the moon goddess for a curse on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men like him are not meant to live. &#34;Who convinced you into this? Luca? You want to leave an Alpha for a rogue?&#34; He asks his tone laced with mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am tempted to tell him that Luca is not just a rogue anymore that he is a hybrid but that would make Luca angry with me so instead I bit my tongue till it almost drew blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, whomever I want to follow after leaving you is none of my business, and just so you know. If you took your time to examine Luca&#39;s face when I made the announcement. You would discover that he was as surprised as you are&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I expected, Lorenzo opened his mouth to talk. Gosh! I don&#39;t even know how I hate Lorenzo more than Dean despite all he did to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it is because Lorenzo is like a baby who is clinging to Dean for help and would do anything to remain in his good books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do know that is not possible. He can banish you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes darted to Luca&#39;s own. He swallows hard at the threat, his hands tighten around the door knob and for some reason, this is suddenly too attractive to look at. He is wearing a white long sleeve but I can still see his muscles inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo bangs the table .&#34;Answer me, and, stop staring at your husband&#39;s cousin when he is here!&#34; He shouts his voice containing venom and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roll my eyes as I reluctantly take my eyes off Luca and back to Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lorenzo!&#34; Luca warns his voice is lethal with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stands up and walks towards him &#34;What? What are you going to do? Kill me because I called her a whore? Or what. Huh, you are the one who convinced her to this nonsense idea you should at least stand up for her!&#34; He shouts as if he made any sense from what he just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca releases him from the door, his hands fall to his waist,  and then he pinches the bridge of his nose. &#34;I did not conceive her into this and I don&#39;t even know what she is doing. I can&#39;t read her mind, but what I do know is that if you say another humiliating word against her, there will be a bloodbath here, and trust me, I will win. I might be a rogue but I will win&#34; he warns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo curls his hands into a fist and sits down. The whole time Dean&#39;s eyes have been on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I divorce you, who will you be with?&#34; He asks calmly, drumming his pen on his table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrug. &#34;Luca,&#34; I answered. The name flows out of my mouth in melody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca&#34; he repeats as he nods his head. His hands are still drumming on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moves his eyes from mine to Luca&#39;s own. &#34;Is this what you&#39;re doing?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca shakes his head. &#34;No,&#34; he answers. His voice is low as if he is gaining cold feet about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh. He could say before everyone that he did not want me. Will I be heartbroken?. Yes. Will I be surprised? No. Why? Because all Attic men are hypocrites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would just either tell Finn when he comes that I have a child for Dean or run away. Either way, I am escaping. I don&#39;t think I would be able to watch his betrayed face for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if Dean senses my insecurity, he asks, &#34;Do you want to? Do you want to marry her? Is she a sort of vengeance for Jenny? I thought my mother was enough?&#34; He asks, and for some reason, Dean&#39;s voice is filled with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of silence passes, and then another passes; dread creeps into my skin. I closed my eyes for a while waiting for him to tell me no. To show me that, for once, I have done something stupid again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me!&#34; Dean shouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At first I did it as revenge to you for Jenny. Then I truly fell for her regardless of who she is to you. So she is not for vengeance,&#34; he says, leaving the part of marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears flood my eyes as I suddenly realize my worth to him. He has indirectly said he loves me, but I am not someone to keep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean opens his mouth to talk again but I open the door and leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia! Lia!&#34; Luca calls but I am already running to my room.</p>
