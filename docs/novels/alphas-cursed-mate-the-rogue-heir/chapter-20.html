                <p>Dean POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I found out that Lia was not my mate, and my heart sank into the depths of my stomach. I knew I was in an impending doom. It seems that the moon goddess has decided to punish me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, I wanted Lia to be my mate again. The concept of Luca or someone else having her did not just sit well with me but I said nothing or did nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was my Luna and my father was dead and she was not my mate neither was I her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I am being honest I knew that the Bloodhound Park was going to attack. I did not just know it would be on the day of our coronation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They not only attacked us, they decided to kill my father when they did not see Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart burned with raw anger for them. The fact that they had killed him on his bed was most insulting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat beside my father staring at his dead ash body. I swallowed whatever lump was in my throat. Hate it or not he had been my father all the skills I had learned had been from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he is gone. Gone with his old croaky voice, his one-sided smile, his glare anytime we had a quarrel and most importantly he was done with his counsel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was clinging to his cold hands when Sasha knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; I said as I cleared my throat and wiped whatever sad face I had. I put on a dark blank face meant for Alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came inside silently, her spicy scent filled the air. She wore a white sleeveless gown with brown scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had come here to seduce me but I needed to put boundaries. I now had a Luna and like it or not, I cared about her opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sasha, why are you not putting on your garment?&#34; I asked her with a steel voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled a sexual smile. &#34;But I am putting on a garment&#34; she answered as she drew her hands across her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head if it was another maid I would have had her head since but because I knew that Lia was not going to let me touch her at least not now I said&#34; I am married Sasha I am not saying I am not going to visit you I am saying dress properly, you are going to be Lia&#39;s maid&#34; I ordered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed &#34;Oh please, you sit here and try to be faithful to a woman that had Finn in her room while Leo killed your father. Come-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her, glaring at her &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled and sat beside me &#34;You heard what I said. I came to give her food and heard Finn talking to her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First of all, I took her hands from my chest and secondly, I made my way towards Lorenzo&#39;s room. What would Finn be doing with Lia?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo received the news with his usual dry composure as he thought of what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She could be lying, you know. It might be that she just wants you to get to her bed, &#34;he said after a long silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I know, but why would she tag lia with Finn, she could have said they were with Luca&#34; I reasoned. &#34;I mean it does not make sense,&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca stared at the ceiling for a while thinking. Why would Finn be with Lia?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo jumped as if he got the solution to the puzzle. He sat up and stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe Finn is her mate&#34; he suggested</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I searched his face for mischief but there was none, I chuckled &#34;Is that the great idea you have?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded&#34;Yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me everything within me not to call him a twat.&#34;Seriously, that&#39;s your great idea&#34; I asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded and sat upright to explain his useless theory&#34;Yes. Come to think of it Dean, there is no way Finn would have searched the entire mansion and not found Lia. She is not a warrior. She did not even know&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meaning?&#34; I asked because I saw no sense in what he was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo shook his head in disbelief, he opened his mouth and I was sure whatever was about to come out would be a curse, I glared at him and he shut his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But seriously, it could be that he spared her life because she is his mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you think Finn would decide to leave his mate in his enemy&#39;s territory?&#34;I asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No but maybe he left her to get accompanied by the fact she is his mate and use her as a spy,&#34; he said. Everything began to make sense to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was why he killed my father because he could not kill her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. That meant he might still be with her in her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to arrest her,&#34; I said. I would not let her go scot-free and if we had his mate, Finn would surely come to look for her and we would make him pay for what he did</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I burst into the room to see another annoying sight. Lia had her hands run resting on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hissed with annoyance, Luca was a coward for falling for his mate while I had his mate locked somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How would his mate feel when she discovered that he was falling for his cousin&#39;s wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to get her out of there before she caught me in her web because no matter how I did it I still felt a sickening feeling anytime I saw her with someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brought in Sasha to testify against her and told my men to arrest her. My thought was that Luca would not let her go freely. Maybe he would challenge me. What I did not know was that he was ready to kill Sasha for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched in awe as he pressed his knife to her neck and his eyes held raw anger. If I forced him he would kill Sasha and feel nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one knew he was a bloodthirsty wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her go&#34; I ordered my men. They let Lia go and I turned to Luca with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Lia told you that she knows her mate?&#34; I asked with a crooked smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face grew pale as he turned to Lia, in that swift instance I brought the white steak and daggered his chest with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would remain there till I deemed it fit to let him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to the already pale Lia with a smile &#34;Now no one would come to your rescue&#34; I said.</p>
