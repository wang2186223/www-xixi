                <p>She&#39;s gone. Like she is really gone. After all the promises and all the sacrifices, she is gone. She did not bother fighting for us. She just left with Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know I was kind of a coward for hugging Jenny when she came, but I missed her. I had always missed her. I missed her to the point that my heart ached at the mention of her name. So it was only natural to hug her, but I expected Lia to understand and not just decide to leave me alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Does she think she would be happy there? With a man that she does not know? Finn might even try to harm her and she has no one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rake my hands on my hair as different thoughts cross my mind. Jenny is in my room waiting for me to come and talk to her as usual. If it was the former me, I would have done that. Maybe kiss her all the way to the bedroom and make love to her, but I was different. Lia had changed me and left with a part of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know you eventually have to talk to her?&#34; Dean said, breaking me from my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him with disdain. &#34;Since when did my life become your business?&#34; I asked him. I knew Jenny was the root of the problem, but that did not change the fact that he tried killing me a few times. He was the one who started with the stabbing saga.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugs. &#34;Come on, man, she is alive. What is the reason for the beef? I let you have Lia even though she was my wife because I was sorry. But now she is here and Lia is gone. You have your mate and I have no one, no mate, no wife, no Luna,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of my heart melted at his pathetic speech but that did not change the fact of what he did over the past years. He talks as if he mistakenly tried to kill Jenny when in reality it was worse than that. He wanted to have sex with her and even asked her to cheat on me several times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blame him for everything. If he had not done this, I would have not bothered following Lia to take revenge. And if I did not follow her to speak, avenge him, I would never have fallen for her. My life would have been so simple, with no feelings attached to it, and I would have gone back to Jenny immediately. She returned instead of pacing around here, trying to remember why I fell for her the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know she is my mate but the bond I shared with Lia is stronger than this. What should I do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if in a clue, Jenny strolled outside to meet me and Dean. Our eyes locked with each other, with no feeling attached. Normally my heart would have been out of my chest by mating low, but our gaze felt empty and irritating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drew my eyes from her face and gazed down at her body. Fuck! Not moved. I didn&#39;t even get a lustful erection, now, which was strange because only looking at lia eyes, I would have been on the ground by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, you can&#39;t even look at me,&#34; she said slowly with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw clenched as I looked at her, forcing myself to say the obligatory word &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I have been busy,&#34; I lied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have not been busy. I do not just want to see you. You are not my lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maids came in with boxes and advanced towards my room side. &#34;Where are you going with this luggage?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annabel answered, &#34;She instructed us to take it to the room next to yours,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! You wouldn&#39;t. You would not move her things into Lia&#39;s room. Take it elsewhere,&#34; I said without thinking. It felt like a sacrilege or like I was cheating on Lia for me to move my mate&#39;s things into her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t just let everything go like that. That room held memories. Memories I would not want to erase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Lia has a mate, Luca. She is gone,&#34; Jenny said as a matter of fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked past them and turned towards them. &#34;Take it to the guest room,&#34; I ordered and turned to Jenny. &#34;We are not yet married. You do not get to disappear for seven years and reappear and think I would accept you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34; she began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I raised my palmitate,, years signaling her to shut up. &#34;I have had enough for today,&#34; I said and walked towards my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything still reminded me of her. Her lavender hair scent still lingered around my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat on my bed with an empty soul. I picked up my pillow and sniffed it, without exhaling. I let her scent intoxicate me and remind me of how her long black hair caressed my face when I tickled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door interrupted my thought. I groaned as I saw Jenny walk inside with a calm look. She still has that milky creamy body and blue eyes. Eyes, but nothing felt attractive again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood before me with soft eyes &#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked, lacking patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat beside me and I felt tempted to send her out, saying, &#34;You have changed, Luca.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed. out, &#34;What were you expecting? For me to sit here and wait for you. Were you expecting me to still be in love with you?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded &#34;Yes. I was away for seven years and I am still in love with you,&#34; she said in a gentle tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell? Did she take me for a fool or what? She expected me to remain in love with her after catching her in bed with my cousin? Seriously</p>
