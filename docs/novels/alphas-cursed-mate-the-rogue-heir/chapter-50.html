                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Easy girl. I need you to be awake. I like loud lively moans&#34; Dean whispered against my ear his voice was filled with loathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold crept into my feet, and my heartbeat increased faster than I expected. I tried to free myself from his grip but he tightened his grip around my waist and his nails dug painfully into my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go, you fucking bastard,&#34; I said lowly which annoyed me because I wanted to shout but it came out as a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled before he drew me to himself, he raised my chin with his two middle fingers making me look at him. &#34;Did you think I was joking about you having babies for me?&#34; He asked with a chill emotionless voice. His alcoholic breath hit my nose making me look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How the hell did I have a child for him? I knew if I did not leave now there would be no going back and besides my eyelids were getting heavier and I felt like a sack of sand. Too heavy to walk alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! Each time Luca was not around something always happened to me. And I was always helpless. If I did not act fast he would have his way with me and no one, not even Finn, would save me. The only person who could do that had traveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He resumed walking me to his room when one of the guests came, &#34;Alpha dean!&#34; He shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was an Alpha from another pack. &#34;How is your Luna feeling?&#34; He asked. I wanted to tell him that I was not fine and that he was about to rape me but then again my mouth felt too heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even if I talked to them they would not even believe me because he was my husband he had the right to have me at any time he wanted without any sort of refusal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called a guard to come &#34;Take her to the room&#34; he said. The guard nodded and walked me to his room and locked me inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dragged whatever energy I had within me and went to the bathroom. I stuck my two middle fingers into my throat for a while until all my food rushed down to the toilet together with the wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did it help? Maybe a little bit. But I still felt sleepy. I flushed the toilet before he could come and sat on the bed, gradually sleeping helped me. I fell on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes or hours later my eyes opened. My head was banging seriously and for a moment my vision was blurry. Then everything reduced gradually and then the memories of the few hours ago played around my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic spread through me. I quickly stood up searching around me. A sigh of relief escaped me when I looked at my clothes and they were still intact. My eyes glanced around the room, I saw a dagger by the side of the bed and picked it up, shoving it into my pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened and Dean walked inside. He glanced at me and licked his lips before he closed the door. I sat up watching him as he took off his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked towards me &#34;You are such an obedient girl. You managed to stay awake just like I ordered&#34; he said with a dirty smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bile welled up within me at the sound of his voice. He was so irritating. &#34;You would be a bastard if you think I would let you touch me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes to me. Confusion watched his face then it washed away replacing it with a blank face. Fear crept into me. His eyes darkened &#34;Well, for starters&#34; he said pulling his trousers &#34;My father is dead so I am practically a bastard&#34; he said with a smile and said, &#34;How the hell are you lucid?&#34; He asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged and got up &#34;This is not going to happen,&#34; I said trying to control whatever suicidal emotions within me because if we were sincere I wanted to kill him. right now like slit his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I walked past him and he grabbed my arms and dragged me back, shoving me on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am your husband and I am going to do anything I want to do with you&#34; he growled as he let go of his boxers leaving him fully naked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved towards his drawer and opened one of his drawers. A gasp escaped me at the sight of what I saw. handcuffs, belts, vibrators, and other sexual material. A shiver ran through my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I allow him to handcuff me then I will be powerless and have nothing to do. I immediately brought out the knife and pointed it towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed when he saw what I did. He did not feel touched by the incident. &#34;Don&#39;t do something stupid. If that knife touches me I am going to be more brutal than I want to be&#34; he warned, his eyes growing darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my grip on the knife. I held onto it like I held it into my knife. He threw his handcuffs into his bed. He advanced towards me, completely naked. I rolled my eyes in disgust. Luca&#39;s dick was bigger than his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you come close I am going to cut you&#34; I warned even though my voice was shaky I tried to be bold. My heartbeat fastened as he advanced towards me. Immediately my skin touched the cold wall I knew I was done for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood right in front of me with a grin &#34;Do it lia, stab me&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that position, I knew I could not stab him. I did not have the mind or whatever it took to stab him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly took the knife from me and threw it on the bed. He grabbed me by my arms and threw me on his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh! This can&#39;t be happening. Tears flowed freely from my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!Bang! Someone was trying to open his door. He stopped on track and hissed in anger. &#34;Raphael tells that person that the Alpha is busy,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no response. Using the opportunity. I shouted, &#34;Somebody help me!&#34; He glared at me covering my mouth with a large palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang! And the door flew open. A familiar scent hit me, it was Luca. His blue eyes met mine for a while and I smiled with gratitude. He smiled back before he advanced on Dean and drove his fist into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you touch her!&#34; He shouted. As he advanced he drove more blows into his face. Dean fell on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He advanced towards me and carried me in bridal style towards his room and laid me on his bed.</p>
