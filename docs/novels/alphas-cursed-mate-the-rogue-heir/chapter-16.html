                <p>She was not my mate. The moon goddess had refused to remate us together after I had rejected her.</p>

                <p>I looked at her face which shone with a smile. She was really happy that she was not mated to me.</p>

                <p>She looked at Luca, whose eyes shone with relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they mated together and refused to tell anyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood at the edge of the hall where they used to hold the ceremony. I watched as dignified people walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha and Luna are accompanied by their Betta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I searched for Lia but she was not in the crowd. Maybe she went to change her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sipped my wine as I smiled at the some familiar faces</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the time it was six-fifty and Lia was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was she? Don&#39;t tell me she wants to be late for our first appearance as couples</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you going to do?&#34; Lorenzo asked as he stood beside me. His hands were in his pocket while the other held a glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About what?&#34; I asked my attention while still in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About lia. We both know she is not your mate&#34; he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged &#34;I don&#39;t know. I mean she was meant to be my mate. I wonder why we were not mated together&#34; I said with a little bit of sadness in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think is her mate? Could it be Luca&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head in disbelief &#34;No, it can&#39;t be&#34; If it was Luca he would have made sure he marked her and made it known to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then who could he be,&#34; he asked, his voice masked with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew why he was worried. I was also worried as well. We did not know who both our mates were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It meant our pack was in trouble. I imagined her mate to be an alpha from an enemy pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would bring in war as he would do everything within his power to have her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let&#39;s not talk about me. Although I felt relieved. It&#39;s not like I wanted to have a mate before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would be free to fuck with whoever I wanted without fear of commitment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with Lia it was different. After seeing her, taking in her scent. All I wanted was to be with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make her mine and make Luca burn with unending jealousy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tuah! Tuah!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gunshots filled the air. Everyone scattered around as they ran for safety. Bodyguards protected their Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I searched around for Lia. She was not around. Lorenzo had already left my side to go and organize our men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s eyes went with mine. He mouthed &#34;Have you seen Lia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. He immediately drifted out of the hall even with the gunshot and for the first time, I thanked my stars that Lia had someone else who cared about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up until now. I thought only bad things happened to me. And to some extent,  I felt it was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like I had a one-night stand and got pregnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mate rejected me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started falling for my husband&#39;s cousin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until the moon goddess decided not to remate me and Dean again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thanked the moon goddess within me. I did not want to go through the excruciating pain I went through the first time when he rejected me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I was sure that if we were related he would cheat on me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately after the ceremony was over, I walked toward my room to change my clothes and put on something more Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that after a while, Dean would start greeting the other Alphas then I would slip to Luca&#39;s side to tease him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I retouched my makeup, smeared my lips with red lip gloss, and sprayed perfume.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way towards my corridor. I had to get to the corridor before seven o&#39;clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tuah!Tuah!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard a gunshot. It meant that we were being attacked. By who? I thought we were at peace with all the packs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately entered the next open room and hid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard footsteps coming this way &#34; Search the whole room we have to find their Luna&#34; a lethal male voice ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heartbeat increased as beads of sweat gathered around my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were looking for me. I moved towards the shelf to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flower vase fell and shattered on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone immediately entered the room, pointing a gun around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I peeped through the books and saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you? Come out!&#34; He shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, what a stupid twat. Who asks someone to come outside when they know that they can hide?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little by little he made his way towards my direction. My heartbeat increased rapidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came closer and soon he was in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared in horror at the man standing in front of me. My heartbeat increased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were wolves, guns could not kill us but they made us weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I was sure they wanted to kill me after all they were looking for Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, amid this confusion and tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stared at each other and chorused &#34;Mate&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me in disbelief as he put his gun down. &#34;Who are you?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, he did not think I was going to reveal my identity because I was his mate. Hell no!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped towards me as my heartbeat increased, and heat oozed out from my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was already reacting to the presence of my mate. He moved the strand of my hair behind my ear. He leaned towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes as sensation flowed through me. I was already wet by the mere touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me who you are and I promise not to hurt you&#34; he whispered against my ear. His hot breath fanned my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a.. I&#39;m Luna&#34; I whispered back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately drew back, his eyes wide with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How come you are my mate?&#34; He asked with disbelief. &#34;Are you not meant to be Dean&#39;s mate?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean rejected me once. We were not related&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck!&#34; He shouted as he punched the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened as someone entered&#34;Finn have you found her!&#34; he asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a split second, he hid me under the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck!&#34; We searched for her everywhere, &#34;the voice said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; send the men back to the cars. Dean would soon retaliate&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other one left immediately after his order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come outside&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came out of the table. He gazed at me. His eyes filled with desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked towards me and sniffed me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would come back for you,&#34; he said and left immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh of relief. &#34;Now who was on earth is Finn and what park is he from&#34;</p>
