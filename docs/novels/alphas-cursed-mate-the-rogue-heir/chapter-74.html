                <p>I turned to face her, seeming genuinely honest. &#34;Tell me, Jenny. What does it look like inside your brain?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened, and she seemed shocked by my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you know how to interpret English?. Or has cheating also eaten your interpretation aspect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, I am sorry,&#34; she apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped my lips &#34;You cheated on me and left without a single word and you expect me to still be in love with you? You still expect me to worship your cheating ass?&#34; I asked angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of anger passed through her eyes as she took in deep lips. sorry, breath to control herself and spoke in a sensually soft voice, &#34;I am sorry Luca, Dean left me with no choice&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I left you with a choice, and that is to be with me. Be my mate and stand by me, out of choice, but you didn&#39;t. instead, you opened your legs for my cousin the moment I was gone and claimed he killed you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed, looking unapologetic. &#34;You criticize me as if Lia did not open her legs for you while her husband was here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was it. That was the sign I needed to throw her out of my room. I grabbed her by her hair and dragged her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say another word about Lia and I would make the lie you told about your death come to life. Get. Out.&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? You are sending me out for lia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, and I would have sent you out for anyone. Now Get out and make sure you&#39;re in the guest house and not in the Lia room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rearranged her clothes and walked toward the door and opened it. She stopped on her track and turned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are not yet over and for your information. Lorenzo is here,&#34; she said and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously! Can I be left alone for a moment? Like, just one moment without anyone offering me sympathy or showing their whorish presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth did Lorenzo want from me now? I thought I had told Dean to stay away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo walked inside with squared shoulders and his permanent poker face oozing his cowardice. He stopped before me with a grin. He scanned through my entire room and returned to my face. His grin is still intact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you knew how stupid you look with that grin you would wipe it off and say whatever brought you here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grin grew awkwardly wider before it disappeared immediately. &#34;I see you haven&#39;t gotten over Lia. You actually fell for her?&#34; He asked, his voice softer than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled to defer if he was saying this out of pity or amusement. What happened to his sarcastic badass tone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked with a serious tone. I did not care if he was here as a friend or as a beta or as a coward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have an enemy inside, sarcastic,&#34; he pointed out. I furrowed my eyebrows. What did he mean by an enemy inside? All our minds were asked to swear an oath of loyalty before the moon goddess asking her to take their life if they ever turned against us in any way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who is this enemy?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat, and looked at me for a while as if he was trying to predict how I was going to react to what he was about to say &#34;Jenny&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes narrowed to a split. &#34;Jenny?&#34; I asked, and he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step towards &#34;&#34;She is an enemy. We are not even sure if she is a witch. We are not sure if she is an imposter and why would she come back to the pack if not because she wanted something and believe it or not? &#34;Dean was not the one who ordered her death. Do you think if Dean was pursuing her, he would give her a chance to write a letter to you claiming that Dean was after her? Yes, he might have slept with her, but he would not want to kill you. We were like brothers back then and you and I know he loved you,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my eyebrows as I glanced at him. Wondering where he was going. &#34;So,. What do you mean?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean wants us to meet at his office right now and talk. We need to know what Jenny wants before we accept her,&#34; he said with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and followed him to the Dean&#39;s office. He sat in his chair while a maid poured wine into three fresh glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gestured at both of us to sit down. I sat beside Lorenzo, still carrying a frown on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you have that is so important to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his glass to the air. &#34;First, I would like to offer a truce to us,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo raised his glass to the air, waiting for me to raise mine. I glared at them. &#34; And how am I sure that this drink is not poisoned?&#34; I asked with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is not, Luca. We were friends and brothers,&#34; Dean said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at them for a while, studying their expression before I raised the glass. Not like I trusted them. The only person I trusted was gone, so there was really no need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clicked the glass and took a gulp before he said, &#34;What do you know about Jenny? Her appearance is so sudden,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crept on my lip. I leaned into the chair. &#34; Well, I know she was my mate. I know you fucked her and I know you wanted to get the dead,&#34; I said nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean pinched the bridge of his nose. &#34;Luca, I am being serious. Does she have any background or anyone outside here that she might have gone to?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I think that question should be for Finn because he was the one that brought her back and took my life with him&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow. &#34;You do realize that you are talking about my wife,&#34; he said with a tone of entitlement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed and tilted my head. &#34;Whatever,&#34; I said and sat up. &#34;I don&#39;t know anything about her, but I think we can ask Sabrina. But for the time being, I don&#39;t want her in Lia&#39;s room and I am serious. If we are to remain friends,&#34; I declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed taken aback by the tone of my voice or how obsessed I was with his wife but that&#39;s none of my business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could call her his wife for all I cared. We both know who owned her. She was mine immediately, I set my eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock came on the door and a guard entered. &#34;Sabrina is here,&#34; he said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her in,&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sabrina walked in with a smile and she was dressed in a long flowing gown, and a long coral bead necklace. She turned to me with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a message for you,&#34; she said in a dreadful calm voice</p>
