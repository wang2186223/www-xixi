                <p>Lorenzo plastered a mocking smile on his face &#34;Awwn can you see&#34; he said pointing at Luca who was behind me glaring at him &#34;Your friend brought her man to fight for her&#34; he said and added chuckling &#34;She brought a rogue to fight a beta,  isn&#39;t that stupidity at its peak&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at  Luca, his jaw tightened as he crossed his arms around his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat, &#34; What do you want Lorenzo?&#34; he asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pointed at me, &#34;Her, or the secret you are keeping,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows, what secret was he talking about? Luca&#39;s eyes were reduced to a split.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stood up from the couch. And strolled towards us with a plastered smile, his blonde hair scattered and his neck still had marks of Luca&#39;s bite in it. I am not even sure he has taken his bath because he still had his blood-stained clothes on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I have been following you all around and I discovered that your mistress here always visits this place so often. I am pretty sure I kidnapped her but don&#39;t remember what happened next. Then it occurred to me, &#34;Is either your mistress cheating on you with someone who is a hybrid or Lexie is the hybrid&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca and I stood there watching him. Without showing any emotions. At least Merlin was out of the question. We could fight on our own without worrying about him and I know for certain that Luca would tame Lorenzo when the time comes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca cleared his throat &#34;You kidnapped her?&#34; He asked feigning ignorance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo cracked a smile &#34;Oh yes but her savior came to release her&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he mean? Did he mean that he knew that Luca was a hybrid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you think I am a hybrid, but you just called me a rogue?&#34; Luca said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not, I know you are a valueless rogue known only for his tyranny.&#34; he said and turned to her &#34;But I do know that she is the hybrid,&#34;  he said pointing at Lexie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca burst into laughter, he laughed and laughed and kept quiet and continued laughing &#34;Seriously, you think Lexie is the hybrid. Did you smell any hybrid in her? You think if she was a hybrid you would not be dead by now?&#34;  he asked, still laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo swallowed hard, and Lexie stared at me with pitiful tear-filled eyes. Her mouth was covered with a bind &#34;Release her and ask her to attack me&#34; Luca said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at Luca, he knew that Lexie was not a hybrid then what was he trying to do? Lorenzo looked at him and foolishly went to Lia asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stand up and change to your wolf form. I want to see you.&#34; He ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lexie quickly changed to her wolf form and back. Lorenzo curled his hands into a fiat as his eyes reddened. He narrowed his eyes at me and Luca and turned away, of course, he will never suspect us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So?&#34; Luca asked &#34;I can&#39;t see a hybrid anywhere?  &#34;he said looking around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo narrowed his gaze to me and advanced me, fear gripped me at the thought of whatever he was going to do. I brought out the wooden stake Luca had given me but Luca stepped in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare&#34; he growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo scoffed &#34;What do you think people are going to say about you? You will be a symbol of pity. Look at the rogue who decided to fuck his lose brother&#39;s wife to comfort himself for his mate that was killed&#34;, he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s shoulders tightened. He never liked people talking about his mate around him. I am sure he missed her from time to time because they shared a bond unlike me who never had a bond with my mate except Finn who seems protective but sometimes it crosses my mind that he might just be pretending to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call her loose again and I will make you lose your head&#34; Luca growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How? Do you want to kill a beta? Your cousin would sentence you for that?&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca tilted his head and scoffed &#34;You seem to be so proud about this beta position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I am,&#34; Lorenzo answered with a hint of pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has it ever occurred to you that a weak-minded Alpha with an ignorant beta would be the worst combination&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean it&#39;s pathetic because you were bitten by a hybrid and you come to threaten the life of a wolf thinking she is a hybrid. I mean, is that the best you can do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would find that hybrid, and I will bring him to hurt you,&#34; he said pointing at Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crept into my lips. He is never going to find the hybrid because the hybrid is the one standing before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you ask the person that healed you of your bite? I am sure she will know&#34; Luca suggested with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took a step backward and started pacing around the room. &#34;You don&#39;t get it Luca, we will be in trouble if the hybrid decides to attack, the park would be in trouble. We don&#39;t even know how many of them are still existing,  &#34;he ponders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca nodded his head as if he was thinking with him. &#34;What are you trying to say?&#34; He asked Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo walked up to him and squeezed his shoulder, he raised his gaze to meet Luca&#39;s own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am saying that we join hands together and bring that hybrid down. We were once brothers, you know, and I still see you as one even though Dean is blinded by revenge. You don&#39;t know who the hybrid would attack next it might be Lia or Lexie or even you&#34; he implored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca scoffed with a smile. &#34;I thought I was a rogue. Useless, right? Is that not what you Guys called me.?&#34;  he asked Lorenzo and pulled him by his collar &#34;We were never friends and we will never be and if you think Dean is the one thirsty for power then you thought wrong. Because I am throne thirsty for vengeance and I will -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door cracked open. I turned to see who it was, and my heart dropped at once. It was Merlin. He stood there looking at us, his hair wet with water. He smiled &#34;Mummy!&#34;</p>
