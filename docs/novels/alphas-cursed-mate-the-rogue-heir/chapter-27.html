                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benedicta told me that the only person Dean feared was Luca. I thought it was a lie, a monster cannot be afraid of anyone until I saw the fear in Dean&#39;s eyes today when he threatened to do something stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw the fear in Dean&#39;s eyes. Even the monster can be afraid of his creator. I gave one last glance at Dean whose face was laced with fear before I took Luca&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the men decide to be foolish. As we approach the door they stop us in the hallway. Luca gives them one last glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of my way before I send your skin to your beloved families&#34; one of them trembles as he drops the sword,  the other still pointing their gun towards us. And steadily they increase in numbers forming a circle around us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the meaning of this?&#34; He asks them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them clears their throat &#34;Alpha Dean has announced that anyone who can kill you will get a higher promotion. He will be the second beta&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roll my eyes. Dean has always been a cunning man but how he was able to make his people cowards too was an unknown myth to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no position as &#34;Second Beta&#34; dumbass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you think you can kill me?&#34; He asks with a surprised voice. His muscles tighten. I can&#39;t tell if he is scared or surprised that his cousin wants him dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them bursts into laughter, and the rest join him although some of them focus on him with prying eyes.&#34; of course, you are the rogue&#34; he says amidst their laughter</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca turned to me. I gasp at the color of his eyes &#34;Go&#34; he orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my mouth to say something but the way he looks at me makes me leave the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only that I don&#39;t entirely leave, I just hide in a safe place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They rush towards him with their swords and guns. He takes out his gun and starts shooting back but before you know his bullet is finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I resist the urge to run to him and save him,  he is becoming weaker. I wonder why Dean would ask for his death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he do this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch with gripping pain in my heart as he gets weaker. He stops fighting. Dean, together with Lorenzo, strolls towards him. His body is covered with blood and cuts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raises his head to look at Dean &#34;Why brother?&#34; He asks with a croaky voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean raises an eyebrow, his side lips lift to a side, and he turns to Lorenzo who is standing at his back&#34;He just called me brother&#34; his tone is filled with mockery and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He points towards him, his tone  with mockery&#34;This twat just called me brother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squats to Luca&#39;s level &#34;You were never my brother and your privilege as a royalty died with my father&#39;s reign. I am the Alpha. I dictate how things happen in my reign &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca bursts into laughter, and everyone goes silent. His laughter echoed around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is also strange is that his laughter is filled with life. Is he not meant to be weak?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean together with Lorenzo stares at him as he stands up still laughing, his teeth covered with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just tell me you are jealous of me. You are not happy that you are never going to be me. Or admit that you get jealous seeing me with your Luna&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? What the hell is he saying? Oh,  he does not know what Dean did to me when he was awake. If he did he would not be here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean breaks into laughter, an unhinged one. &#34;You think I want Lia. Seriously? Do you think I would look after a girl like her? I want you dead because you want me dead not because of some infatuation you have with Lia. She is my Luna and will continue to be one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; No, you are just angry because she is the only one who has refused to bow down to you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean scoffs as he folds his arm &#34;Did she tell you that? Because if I can recall I almost made her die because she dared to defy me and bring Finn, her mate, into our home which killed our father!&#34; He shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a split moment Luca rushes to him pulling him by his collar &#34;You did what?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard me. I made her skin bleed!&#34; He said, staring at Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a moment Luca drags out the white oak from under his shirt, Lorenzo rushes to meet him but he is too late, he has already stabbed Dean. He watches as Dean turns white and falls to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo rushes to him with range, he drives a blow into Luca&#39;s chest but he seems unaffected. He continues raining blows on him until Luca grabs his hand stopping him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean will only rise if he wants to and contrary to mine he does not have any supernatural to help him&#34; he blurts out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo glared at him one last time,  panting heavily &#34;I will deal with you!&#34; He shouts as he storms away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca turns to the men who bow immediately to him and an evil smile creeps into his face. He pulls out his blood-soaked shirt, gives it to one of them, and walks away in my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hide behind the pillars. For some reason, I am scared of Luca right now. I have never seen him this ruthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked past me, and I heaved a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell Lia to see me now!&#34; he shouts. He is not heading to his room. He is heading to Dean&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the time being Lorenzo is going to be in charge. This will give a glimpse of his rule. I walk towards my room and change my clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My new maid knocks on my door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Luca wants to see you,&#34; she informs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I give her a light nod and make my way towards Dean&#39;s room. This is the first time I will be seeing him.</p>
