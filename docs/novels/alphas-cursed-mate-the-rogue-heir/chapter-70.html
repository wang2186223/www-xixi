                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride towards Finn Pack is enveloped in heavy silence. Just the sound of our breathing and the car engine sound. He would occasionally steal a glance at me and then go back to his iPad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did I get here? I was meant to go back with Luca to the place. Take off his shirt, have cool sex, and then draw him, but here I was with a man I did not know taking me to a place where I knew nobody. Why did the moon goddess decide to be this wicked and separate two lovers from each other when we are usually mated within our pack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe the moon goddess knew that Luca did not love me that much. How come Jenny resurfaced after seven years of death? Could she really be the one, or maybe an imposter? The only person who would give me an answer to that question is Finn, And I don&#39;t think Finn would tell me. He hates the fact that I am into Luca already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wonder if Luca would take his interest in sculpting. Maybe he will. After all, already he has his muse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Penny for your thoughts?&#34; Finn asked, drawing me back from my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged the corner of my lips. &#34;You don&#39;t even have a penny,&#34; I said, even though I knew he had money with him. All Alpha is rich.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And besides, my thoughts are not that interesting,&#34; I said with a shrug, trying so hard to maintain my smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How would he feel if he found out that I was daydreaming about drawing Luca&#39;s body? Will he ever take an interest in what I do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything about you is interesting, lia,&#34; he said  &#34;Tell me what you were thinking about? Was it Luca?&#34; He asked with a hint of anger and jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed whatever was in my throat. &#34;No. I just wanted to know If I can visit my friends before I go. I mean, none of them know I am leaving and then I want to see my guardian. She took care of me. That&#39;s if you please&#34; I pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me for a while and I wondered what he saw when he looked at my face. &#34;Fine, but don&#39;t try to escape, I will find you&#34; he warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. Escape you,  where would I run to, and he seems to be watching my every move? I would not do something like that again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t run. I have no one to run to,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. The car went back to its comfortable silence. We both to our thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please stop,&#34; I told the driver when we got to Lexie Street. I can&#39;t imagine that I am going to tell Lexie goodbye again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I come with you?&#34; He asked with concern as I tried stepping outside. I shook my head.&#34; Don&#39;t worry. She does not know you.&#34; I said. He nodded, he opened his mouth to say something,,  but immediately closed his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed the door behind me and went to Lexie&#39;s house. I took in a heavy breath as I knocked on the door. For years she had been my best friend and had protected me even before I became Luna and I usually missed her a few times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I am being truthful, I preferred when I was not Luna. Life was easier without it, but then again I would not have met Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on the door thrice before it opened. She was putting on a shirt black leather band applied some makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face turned into a frown as she looked at me. She stepped aside for me to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened? You don&#39;t look happy?&#34; She asked, her voice laced with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did something happen to Merlin? And where is Luca? Don&#39;t tell me he played with your feelings again? I thought you said you were convincing him to go on a date with you?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded as tears gathered in my eyes. &#34;I am fine, Lexie. I.. I just wanted to tell you,&#34;&#34; I informed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her eyebrows &#34;Goodbye, eyebrows. Goodbye? Where are you going?&#34; She asked as she led me to a couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She disappeared into the kitchen came back with a glass of juice, and gave one to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Finn is my mate,&#34; I said, and she nodded her head. I remember how she had asked me to stay with Luca instead of Finn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He came to take me today. I am going to his pack&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; she asked, then her eyes widened with realization. &#34;Oh, no,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Luca let you go just like that? what did Dean say, or did Luca betray you?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;He has a mate, Lexie. Jenny is alive,&#34; I announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spat out the juice in her mouth as she coughed, hitting her chest a little. &#34;Jenny is alive? But she died seven years ago. That was the reason behind the feud between them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but she is in the palace right now with Luca&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How? I mean, how did she enter? What was her story? Why did she disappear?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. I did not know about her story. Luca had refused to open up about them. All he told me was that Dean killed his mate, who he loved and he, in return, killed his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How come she had been with Finn all this while? Something did not just sound right between them. Could this be a ploy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finn had her. He asked Luca to let me go and Luca refused. So he said a mate for a mate-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Luca, let you go? Seriously?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh, not exactly. He let go of me to meet Jenny. Although he begged me to stay, I refused. There was no reason to stay when he had a mate. So I left. I am going to Benedicta&#39;s place&#34; to tell her about the news and leave&#34; I informed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, when are we going to see each other again?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will always call you and maybe I will visit you one day,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I will miss you,&#34; she said with a trembling voice as she hugged me tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too&#34; I whisper back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time we pulled away from each other, my eyes were already filled with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a gulp of the drink and walked towards the door. &#34;I will see you soon,&#34; I said and hugged her for the last time before leaving.</p>
