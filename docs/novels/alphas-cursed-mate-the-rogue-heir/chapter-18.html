                <p>Lia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank into my stomach at the sight of Finn in my room not just in my room, but on my bed, and not only was he in my bed he was shirtless. Displaying his godly abs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here,&#34; I asked in a whisper. It was meant to come as a bold threatening voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was our enemy, even though he was our mate. His father wanted my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that he came to take me secretly, lure me out of the palace maybe fuck me once or twice, and then kill me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Different thoughts ran through my mind. The air in the room became so thick that I could not breathe, beads of sweat laced on my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up from the bed and walked towards me. I bent my head in fear, and my hands trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His two middle fingers found my chin as he lifted my head to him making me stare at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the fear vanished, it was replaced by a burning sensation that crept on my skin as I looked at his dark blue eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Breath&#34; he ordered slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled and exhaled for a while trying my best to control whatever emotion that was flooding me. Whatever feeling made my nipples rise and my core wet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he noticed that I had managed to steady my breaths he took a step backwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not here to hurt you if that&#39;s what you are thinking.&#34; He said softly and walked towards my bed and a sardonic smile crept on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought out his gun and placed it on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was loaded. I could tell from the way he placed it carefully, then he looked at me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear gushed within me, and my tongue turned dry. I had no weapons with me, not even a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t kill me&#34; I begged as my thoughts ran to my son. He can&#39;t be left alone in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the gun and walked up to me. I sucked in my breath as I watched him raise the gun to caress my face. It stopped at my lips and for a moment, just one moment I was tempted to scream Luca&#39;s name but his recent behaviour made me stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are my mate, I would never let any harm come to you lia,&#34; he said and took my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still staring at me he placed the gun in my hands &#34;It&#39;s the only weapon I have. It&#39;s in your hands. I can&#39;t hurt you&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed whatever lump in my throat. He had made himself available at my mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was my second chance mate. I might not find another mate after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s talk,&#34; he said and walked back to the bed, he sat down and placed his palm on the other side signaling me to sit beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked up to him and sat beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat and spoke. His deep, rich husky voice caressed my skin &#34;Are you going to tell him or should I do the honors&#34; he asked as his eyes bore holes into my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows &#34;Who are we talking about here?&#34; I was confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow as he watched my face for some trace of mischief. I sincerely did not know who he was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean. When are you going to tell him that I am your mate?&#34; He asked calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my eyes away from his. Why has the moon goddess decided to be this wicked? How can she put me in this dilemma? I was Dean&#39;s Luna, Luca&#39;s friend, or whatever was going on between us and Finn&#39;s mate who was my enemy, and worst still I had a child for Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pack would not accept an illegitimate child, Dean did not remember that night or anything that happened between that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleared my throat &#34;Your father wants me dead&#34; I said as I tried to avoid the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was because he thought you were Dean&#39;s mate but since you are my mate. He would be happy. Besides, I have been dying to see my mate&#34; he replied with a smile. I could tell that he was genuinely happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile watched away as it came &#34;Are you in love?&#34; He asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With whom?&#34; I asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean. Is that why you are hesitating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head immediately &#34;No!&#34; I shouted as irritation crept on my face. That man had no feelings for anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were mates but he rejected me&#34; I noted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded with a smile &#34;Good!. If not I would be forced to kill him&#34; he added and stared at me before his eyes landed on my pink lip. His gaze darkened then he looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So when are you going to tell him? I need an exact time so that when I come to claim you. You will be ready&#34; he said and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A week or two,&#34; I said. I  needed to see Benedicta and Lexie and arrange things out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded with a smile and leaned towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sucked my breath, and fire erupted around me as a sensual sensation washed through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips met mine, his lips soft and tender, I closed my eyes and opened my mouth to take in his warm scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss was sweet, soft, and delicate. He broke it. We were breathing heavily. A smile placed on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our eyes burned off desires &#34;I will come back for you in two weeks&#34; he said and put on his white shirt he dropped his gun on my table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Use it to protect yourself&#34; he ordered. I nodded even though I did not know how to shake a gun. He pecked my forehead and left the way he came through the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled as I watched him walk. For the first time in my whole life. I felt loved, I felt valued. Even after he left his eyes still bored into my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud bang brought me from my thoughts. It was Luca&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rushed towards the door and opened it. &#34;What happened?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ignored me and burst into my room searching around for someone&#34;Dean&#39;s father was killed by Leo, Finn&#39;s beta. He had escaped but we think Finn might still be around?&#34; he informed me.</p>
