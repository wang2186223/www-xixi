                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped immediately as I entered the palace and saw Finn standing in front of Dean and Lorenzo, who had a frown on their faces. Luca immediately tightened his grip on my waist. What was he doing here? He said he would give me three days, so why the hell was he here? For days, I haven&#39;t even gotten the chance to see Merlin or Lexie. I was not even ready to leave Luca. Is not as if I was going to follow him, anyway. The mate bond was there. I felt the pull. It was nothing to compare to what I shared with Luca. My clothes still had his musky scent around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I asked in an evenly calm voice. Trying to hide whatever anger was welling up within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strolled towards me, his bodyguard at his back. All armed with daggers and guns. He was wearing a three-piece black suit and a black shoe. He would normally look attractive to others, but not to me. The only attractive wolf I knew was Luca, and I intend to keep it that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out to caress my face, but Luca pushed me behind him. Making him stand in front of him. I could see Luca&#39;s tensed shoulder. He was tense, I could see it. We had discussed this several times, and I had promised him that I would stay with him, and even with my promise, he was still scared. Scared of losing me and so was I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn&#39;s face changed to a frown immediately as he dropped his hands to his side. He inhaled and exhaled, trying to maintain his self-control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat. &#34;Lia, I came to take you. Let&#39;s go home,&#34; he said with a warning voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only home she knows is here and not your pack. Alpha Finn,&#34; Luca replied with great disdain in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crept onto Finn&#39;s lip. &#34;She is my mate, Luca, and your cousin&#39;s wife. Have you no shame?&#34; He asked in a teasing voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel the anger evaporating out of Luca&#39;s body. He was clearly trying to control himself from doing something drastic and revealing his identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is a business, not yours,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to take me, but I hugged Luca from behind. Trying to make sure I was safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he discovered that I was not moving an inch from Luca&#39;s body. He decided to tease the version of Luca that he knew &#34;I wonder why your brother has not killed you. You are a useless tyrannic rogue. Let go of her now or I will kill you before all of them,&#34; he warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes moved to Dean. He had a smile on his face as he watched the argument between them. Lorenzo was by his side. He whispered something into his ear, but I read his mouth &#34;Just as we planned&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could they have planned? Were they the ones that sent Finn here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First, Dean Is not and would not be my brother. And secondly, I am not letting go,&#34; he growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean and Lorenzo nodded with amusement. Finn approached Luca with the white stake. Then it dawned on me. They wanted to make sure Luca got Finn angry and then killed him. It would be that Luca challenged an Alpha and not the other way around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let go of Luca&#39;s body and stepped in front of Luca. &#34;Lia, what are you doing?&#34; Luca asked in a pleading tone. Like he was saying, saying, please don&#39;t leave me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I lia Pierce, Luna of the Attics pack rejects you, Alpha Finn of the Bloodhound pack,&#34; I said and added &#34;Leave the palace immediately,&#34; rejecting orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of pain passed through Finn&#39;s eyes. He dropped his gaze to my eyes, staring at me with his intense blue eyes. My heartbeat increased, and my knee got weaker. He was trying to use the mate bond to manipulate me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Alpha Finn of the bloodhound pack reject your rejection,&#34; he said calmly and added &#34;You are my mate lia! I waited for weeks to have you! You said you would come with me! Not the other way round! You and I know that mate bond is stronger than the flung you have for him! He is a fucking rogue!&#34; He shouted, making me flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to tell him to get out, wanted to reprimand him for calling Luca a rogue and for calling whatever we had a fling!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think if he had his mate, you would be important to him?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard. Would Luca sacrifice his mate for me? Whatever. It&#39;s been seven years since Dean killed his mate, but he still hates Dean for years. As if on cue, Luca wrapped his arms around my waist, soothing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We love each other and I would not leave him&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn chuckled. &#34;Well, I have also come to love you, Lia. To crave your cinnamon hair scent. To watch over you. To count the freckles on your face and everything. You have made me obsessed with you. I would be damned if I let him have you,&#34; he confessed. My heart weakens a little with his confession. I was not even sure that Luca knew my hair scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not letting her go,&#34; Luca said in an oddly calm voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn shook his head. &#34;how about we renegotiate,&#34; he said. &#34;A mate for a mate,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Luca said. Dean and Lorenzo gave him a questioning look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a lady walked in from behind, the sound of her high heels echoing around the room. She stood beside Finn and Luca immediately left me. Like he actually stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had blonde long hair, and brown eyes with a one-sided dimple. She wore a white gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze hovered around me, and she stretched forth her hand &#34;You must be Lia. The one everyone wants,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I am Jenny. The one everyone needs&#34; she said.</p>
