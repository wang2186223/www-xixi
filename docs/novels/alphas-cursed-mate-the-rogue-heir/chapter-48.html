                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later Luca&#39;s door opened and then closed and he was gone but all I found myself thinking about was what he said before he left. How his voice sounded so weak because even if I knew he did not say please he was indirectly pleading with me to not leave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tossed around my bed as our few cherished memories replayed in my head. Unlike Finn who just came in here to remind me of who he was. Finn was my mate for sure and I was bound to feel emotionally or sexually drawn to but all I could find myself thinking about was how he would have treated me if I was his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would have probably killed me, unlike Luca who would do everything within his grasp to make sure I was happy. Finn simply viewed our bond as a business deal. He cannot lose because of me that is why he killed my Alpha in my place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted Luca, I wanted him so badly. I wanted him inside me, wanted to feel the heat of his mouth against my nipples. Memories of our last encounter flooded my mind and sent strange warmth to the bottom of my belly and between my toes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on my door disrupted me from my thoughts. I groaned in frustration. Who could that be and what did he want from me now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in!&#34; I shouted, too tired to stand up and open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, it would be the maid  I would ask her to wash some of my clothes but then the door opened revealing a sweaty shirtless Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was he doing here? And why was he here like this dressed in grey sweatpants? What was he trying to do? seduce me? Eww, bile welled up in my tummy at the thought of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what you see?&#34; He asked with raised eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes &#34;You need to get rid of that pickup line. It is getting old. Don&#39;t you think? &#34;I asked sharply. Making him know that I was not impressed by whatever he was trying to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled a little bit, &#34; That does not answer my question,&#34; he replied lazily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat upright. &#34;Well, if it was Luca it would have been a dream come true but it is you so no need&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of anger passed through his eyes and I smiled satisfied at what I just did. He needed to know that there was no place for him within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat &#34; That&#39;s my cousin we are talking about &#34;he replied casually trying to hide his anger which was evident in his tightened muscles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged &#34; Well I am a whore&#34; I replied using his words against him &#34;What would you expect?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard, and a moment of silence passed through us. Each second my irritation grew larger. &#34;What do you want, husband?&#34; I asked with a smile, a smile that was evident enough for everyone to know it was fake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged on his lips &#34;At least you remember that I am your husband. May I sit?&#34; He asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and tapped my side for him to sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will be having a party this evening,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded &#34;Well, I have already figured that out&#34; I replied trying to sound happy and not over bored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I want you to put in your best outfit and come to the party without any grudges toward me&#34; he said lowly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, unsure of what he meant by &#34;Without any grudge toward me&#34;. Oh, mean why would he think I would not have a grudge against him after what he did?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Okay, I will try to act like a good couple. Although you should not blame me if my facial expression acts otherwise&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged at the side of his lips &#34;Good. I sent you some clothes. I am sure you have gotten them,&#34; he said and stood up to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait. I am not comfortable with the clothes. I want to put on something that will show my shape and beauty&#34; I said, turning around for him to see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something that will show my back a little and will show the marks on my body, &#34;I said teasingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened with strange emotions. Maybe it was annoyance or guilt. Although I was very certain that someone like that would feel guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped as my eyes widened. Did he just say please? Then the realization hit me suddenly. He was up to something. Something that I would not know until the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to play along by nodding slightly &#34;Okay&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes brightened, he nodded with a smile and left. Immediately he closed the door behind him. I let out a sigh and moved quickly to lock the door in case he came to show his confusing face again in front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rushed back to the clothes he had sent my maid to deliver to me. I searched thoroughly for a trace. Something that would tell me he had evil intentions against me. Like maybe he poisoned the cloth because this man wanted me dead just a week ago. Surely he can&#39;t just fall in love with me and want me to put everything aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He surely had a motive but what could that motive be? I asked myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of my phone interrupted my thoughts. I rushed towards it. It was an unknown number. Who could this be? I asked myself as I picked up the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, gorgeous,&#34; the caller said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows. Was this a trick or something? Who sits down and calls someone gorgeous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch, thought you would recognize your mate,&#34; the caller said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart dropped for a minute &#34;Finn?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, love. I heard they would be having a party at your palace today. Just wanted to ask if you would spare me just a few minutes to dance with you?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Finn. I don&#39;t have time for that. What do you want?&#34;I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. Just a dance with you&#34; he replied with a teasing tone and hung up before I could reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned, can a day be more hectic?</p>
