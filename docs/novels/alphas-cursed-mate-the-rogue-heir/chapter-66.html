                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since I mentioned the museum date, Luca had been behaving strangely. Seemed distant, always lost in his own thoughts. It&#39;s as if the museum brings back memories he wants to keep behind. Memories that are hurting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him this empty and distant leaves me with an overwhelming desire to crawl underneath his skin find out what is wrong and take it away. At first, I thought it was because he did not want me or maybe he was scared of being seen with me but right now, it seemed I have never been the problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I notice it I try asking him about it but he cleverly dodges the question by giving me a mind-blowing orgasm in the car. The fact that he let me fill his car with my moan while he drove, drives me insane and for some goddamn reason, I find it incredibly attractive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then we got to the museum, and he immediately became tensed. Though he tried to hide it, I could feel it through his sweaty palm and his tightened muscles, although I refused to ask him. Is not as if I ask him he would answer me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca!&#34; I call out when I discover that he has zoned out again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flinched a little as his attention fell back on me. His forehead is sweaty and his blue eyes are darker, like a troubled sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk up to him, closing the distance between us. His eyes fall down to my face and it softens for a while. &#34;You have not been listening to me. If you are not happy about the date, we could leave,&#34; I say, my voice soft with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilts his head from my eyes. &#34;Lia, I&#39;m fine,&#34; he says. but I know he is lying. His voice sounds deep with rumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Luca, you are not fine. You have not been listening to any word I said&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have been listening. You said you would draw me when you get back. You would use me as your muse to begin drawing again,&#34; he says with a soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile reaches mine. Although he got it wrong, I can&#39;t help but smile at the importance he attaches to me being his muse, nevertheless, he is hiding something. I can tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I right?&#34; He asks with a smile that brightens his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head &#34;No, I was telling you that I would only draw if you sculpture,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light in his eyes dims, and he removes his eyes from mine as his face dampens &#34;I am not a sculptor&#34; he lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like Luca is actually lying to my face right now. &#34;That&#39;s a lie, Luca. You are a sculptor. I know you are a sculptor. I have seen the hidden sculptures you hide and the unfinished ones. I don&#39;t know the reason you stopped, but I believe that you can start again. That was why I brought you to the museum, so you can regain your passion,&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widen for a while before it returns to normalcy. &#34;It&#39;s not that easy, lia. You don&#39;t just gain a passion for something because I visited the museum,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod. I knew what he was saying was true, but I still wanted him to gain a little inspiration from the museum. Maybe seeing what he loved will help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile cracked his lips as he drew me to himself. &#34; You can be my inspiration, you know?&#34; He whispered against my ear in a teasing tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lean against his comforting abyss even though I know he is trying to avoid the question with a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; I ask, returning his teasing tone with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By this,&#34; he says as he uses his hand to caress my neck down to my breast. He grabs it for a while. Excitement rushes towards me and my nipples stand piercing my gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes for a moment even though we could get caught. A moan escapes my lips. Excitement when he pinches my nipple, sending delicious pain around my body. I clench my thigh to avoid the throbbing reaction in between my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca, we are in the museum,&#34; I whispered, trying hard to control myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods. His lips find their way to my neck and he bites it a little. He cups my boobs in his hands &#34;Look around&#34; he orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately turn around. There are still a few people around, but not that much. &#34;There are people around,&#34; I whispered back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods. &#34;Come with me,&#34; he orders as he drags me to a room. He locks the door immediately behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, he grips my hair and drives me into a passionate kiss. I murmur amidst it &#34;We could be caught, Luca&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remains silent for a while. He lifts my short gown and runs his hands over my wet pants. His eyes darken with desire. &#34;More reason we need to be fast,&#34; he says and shoves his hands into my hole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moan escapes me, I grip his hair as he increases his pace. He places a soft kiss on my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I moan &#34;Luca please&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please what?&#34; He asks against my earlobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please fuck me. I need you inside me,&#34; I plead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crooked his lips &#34;I thought you were worried about us getting caught?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded as I bit my lips to stifle my moan. I am about to come. Just when I am about to come, he removes his hands. My eyes widened. Don&#39;t tell me he is about to leave me unsatisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He unbuckles and removes his trouser as he brings out his dick, which is already erect. He grabs me closer to himself as he thrusts himself into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scream escapes my lips as he covers my lips to prevent my moan from coming out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He groans immediately as he has entered fully. &#34;Fuck lia. He groans immediately upon fully entering and says, &#34;Your hole was made just for me,&#34; before starting to thrust deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room temperature increased. Thank God this place is quiet. The probability of getting caught having sex increases my excitement driving me to pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck!&#34; he groans as he comes. Our breathing reduces back to normal. He stays there for a while, leaning against me, his dick still in my Virgina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some minutes, he removes his dick and tucks in. He cleans my thigh with his handkerchief before pressing a kiss on my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; he says with a smile. We walk out looking innocent. The ride back home is silent, just filled with him stealing glances at me and smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, we step outside. I immediately feel something is wrong. The atmosphere feels tight and heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we stepped into the hall, I froze. Finn is standing in the middle with Dean and Lorenzo by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grins at me, and Luca tightens his grip around my waist. &#34;hello love&#34;</p>
