                <p>Dean&#39;s father was dead. He was killed by Leo, Finn&#39;s beta. The same Finn who was my mate. The same Finn who had been in my room and kissed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here I thought he risked his life to see me. I suddenly felt dirty and used. He did not come here because he valued me. He came to my room to pass the time while his friend killed my Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he would be safe with me after all I was his mate. No one would come here so he let himself play with my feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curled my palms into a fist as anger swept through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see him?&#34; Luca asked me. His eyes were red with anger. Dean&#39;s father was the only one whom he had on his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he committed such an atrocity he still welcomed him when he came back. Losing him must have been painful to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head &#34;No. I don&#39;t even know who he is&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca sniffed around the room. I sucked in my breath. Hope he did not smell him. I would be dead. It would mean I harbored a killer in my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca&#39;s eyes reduced to a split, he glanced through me from my shoes to my top. He glanced around the room looking for some clue. He walked towards me steadily with baby steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you know?&#34; Luca asked as his rough palm caressed my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in a shaky breath, my palm became sweaty like a wet towel. I swallowed hard &#34;What do.. Do you mean? If I knew somethingI would tell you&#34; I stuttered looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at me for a while before he stepped back. &#34;Keep your door open. I will be back&#34; he ordered and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in a shaky breath as he closed the door. I took my pillow but it smelt different. It smelt of Finn. I took out my perfume and sprayed it around my pillow before lying on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes as my mind went back to his full pink lip, his smell, the kiss. I moved my hands to feel my lips, and my thumb caressed his impact on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly drew my hands from what I was doing. Gosh! Why would I let such a memory get to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knock! Knock! Knock!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and went to open the door. Luca came inside. His shoulders tensed. His face carried a sardonic tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I asked immediately I closed the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept quiet for a while and sat in my bed. Up until now, I had known Luca to always carry a blank face. His emotions were calculative but seeing him like this with his head bent. I knew that his uncle&#39;s death had pained him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean thinks I killed his father.&#34; He said in a low voice. He ran his hands across his head vigorously, when he raised his head his eyes were tear-stained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could he think so low about me? I mean he is my uncle. He was the only one who loved me even though I was a rogue. My father hated me for being a rogue. How could he think that I wanted to kill him&#34; he asked. His voice sounded broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards him and rubbed his shoulders. The fact that he came to me meant he valued me, he saw me in a higher way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;you can explain yourself besides you said it was Leo. Right?&#34;I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;They caught him. But he still thinks that I am responsible maybe I sneaked him in or something&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sniffed in loudly with shaky breaths. His veiny hands trembled. He was in so much pain, seeing him like this made my heart ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean he is my uncle. Why on earth would I want to hurt him? I don&#39;t hurt the people I love&#34; he said and the last part felt as if it was directed at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard. He took in unsteady breath &#34;He thinks I did it for you,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows &#34;What?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head and nodded &#34; He thinks we are fucking each other&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face grew pale. &#34; why would he think about us like that &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean is very observant. He saw the way you hugged me. He said he sees the way we look at each other&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, he stared at me for a while. Our eyes moved to our lips, and we drew closer to each other&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door burst open. Dean, Lorenzo, and Sasha came in all glaring at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sasha pointed at me &#34;I heard her talking to Finn&#34;  she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth in shock. I stared at her. Luca burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this a joke? What will Finn be doing with her?&#34; he asked still laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard him talking to her,&#34; she said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not even my mate. You are going to pay dearly&#34; he said and ordered some men to take me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a split moment,, Luca had his dagger pressed against Sasha&#39;s neck. Her eyes shone with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Touch her and I promise to throw your fucking buddy into the den or give the pieces of her body to the dogs&#34; he threatened. His voice was so lethal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Sasha was his mistress. No wonder I was not okay with being friends with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s jaw clenched. &#34;Luca let her go&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let Lia go&#34; he retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or else what?&#34; Dean asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or else I am going to do to you what you did to me. Lia is not your mate so she is safe and I will keep her but I will make sure I kill your mate the instant you set your eyes on her&#34; he warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They glared at each other for a while. Luca pressed the blade against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; let her go&#34; Dean ordered.</p>
