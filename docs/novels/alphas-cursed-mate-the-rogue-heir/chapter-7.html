                <p>Dean&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as she shamefully walked away. All eyes were on her. A pang of guilt filled my heart as I wondered how people would mock and insult her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a beautiful girl. Someone I would normally want to fuck, but not to keep as a wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make matters worse, she was a rogue! Not a wolf or an omega, a fucking rogue!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did the moon goddess decide to be this wicked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway, that&#39;s not my business. I should remove her from my head. The earlier I did, the better for me. I would not want to find myself thinking about some rogue girl. Who is nobody?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father cleared his throat, disrupting my thoughts. I straightened my shoulders, ready for him to lash out at me, or maybe insult me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would not really bother me. After all, I warned him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His nostrils flared as he glared at me. In return, I gave him my best smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up to address the pack, maybe to tell them to continue with the ceremony or tell them they will soon have their Luna. A promise I knew would never come to pass, at least not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wolves of Attics Pack. As you all saw today. My son, Dean, has rejected the gift the goddess gave to him for a mate. With this rejection, I am beginning to feel unsure about his potential as the next Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows as my muscles tensed. What was he trying to say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is he trying to say I am not going to be a worthy alpha?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nah, I shook the thought away from me. I am his only child, the most feared Alpha among the other alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am a potential asset. He would not deny me of my throne because I rejected some rogue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear murmuring among my wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me and I returned it with a glare; he returned it with a smile. &#34;Therefore, I strip him of his position as the heir till he proves otherwise. Bear in mind that he might become the heir or Luca, his cousin, the rogue would become the Alpha.&#39;&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I burst into laughter. He glared at me, but I kept on laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really thought of all the ways to threaten me and you came up with the idea of making Luca the next Alpha. Serious?&#34; I inquired, my eyebrows raised as I glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can make anyone my heir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the best option is Luca. The rogue? Have you forgotten what he did to us or should I reveal it to everyone?&#34; I asked, pointing at the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council of elders furrowed their eyebrows. As they whispered to each other. Of course, they did not know what he did. They would have killed him if they knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean!&#34; my father shouted, his hands rolled into a tight fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father!&#34; I shouted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To think that he for once considered making Luca the Alpha was a painful discovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger was bottled up in my chest. I closed my eyes for a moment as I tried to control the anger that crept under my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this while, I have been a faithful son, a suitable heir. I have conquered more parks than he did when he was my age and then he just decided to blow everything up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why on earth should I feel surprised? He had never loved me, only seen me as an heir, someone to continue his throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It has always been Luca right from time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was young and made a mistake, he gave me punishment too much for my age, but whenever it was Luca, he would say &#34;he is just a kid&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tap on my shoulders brought me back to reality, and I realized that all this while I had been glaring at my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo came from my back and whispered into my ear &#34;Dean, let&#39;s get out of here&#34; he said, tapping my shoulders as he tried to calm me down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at my father once more and walked away. Straight to my room, with Lorenzo following me at my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately we got to my room, I slammed the door so hard. In Fact, I was sure people outside would have heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare he threaten me with Luca? Of all the wolves, Luca?&#34; I asked him even though I knew we both knew the answer, but still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a bottle of Scotch and poured it into two empty glasses. He handed one to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the glass from him and took it in one gulp and gave him to fill it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched me keenly for a while. I waited for him to speak up. Sometimes, it was hard for me to read him, especially when he wore a blank face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes narrowed to him. &#34;To who?&#34; I asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To your father. Let him win this time or else he will give your place to Luca, we know that he can do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed the Scotch in my glass, glaring at him with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never!&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smacked his tongue against his teeth, &#34;The problem with you is that you never listen. Accept her and move on. She can become your Luna and nothing will happen except you want something to happen. &#39;&#39; he looked at me, allowing his words to sink in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can even divorce her after your father&#39;s death. But now your priority should be being the Alpha and nothing else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever he said was true. I can&#39;t sacrifice my throne for a girl. And I could divorce her after the wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at him. He smiled back with understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh, whoever gave beta&#39;s, I am very happy you gave me Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now go,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled and went towards my father&#39;s chambers. I knocked at him and entered. He was pulling his crown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you changed your mind?&#34; He asked as he took off his watch and wore his slippers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bowed my head and lowered my voice, trying to sound genuine. &#34;Yes, Father, I am sorry,&#34; I pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to me with a smile. &#34;Good, that&#39;s my son,&#34; he said and walked up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow, we will start the remaining ritual,&#34; he said. &#34;Okay, you will eventually fall in love with her. The moon goddess made it that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bowed to his height and let him kiss my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock came in, without waiting for an answer. The person came in. My eyes widened in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi uncle,&#34; he greeted with a smile as he bowed toward him. My dad touched his head and raised him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never said you were coming,&#34; he replied with a smile. His eyes glinted with happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes. I needed to leave this room right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to me. &#34;Hi Dean, I heard you were holding a ceremony to find your mate, but when I came back, I was told you rejected her. May I ask why?&#34; he said, giving me a mocking smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;it&#39;s none of your business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed, &#34;Of course, it is my business. Heard the girl you rejected is a rogue, just like me. You rejected your cousin&#39;s kind,&#34; he said, hitting me playfully on my chest. I glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But don&#39;t worry, I am sure uncle will convince you as for now I have to go and settle something urgently,&#34; he said walking towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I released a deep breath, happy he was going to leave me. He stopped at the door and turned back with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hope you missed me,&#34; he said and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately he left, and I turned towards my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you invite him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he came on his own and cheered up,&#34; he replied, tapping my shoulders. &#34;He&#39;s your cousin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I removed his hands from my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Over my dead body will I accept him as my cousin!&#34; I said and left.</p>
