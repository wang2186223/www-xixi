                <p>Luca POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lia came into my life I had my good and bad days. There were some days where I was driven with utter range. Guess this range came from the way I was treated because I am a rogue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Discovering I am a hybrid has been a curse and a blessing. A blessing because I was now stronger than those who mocked me. A curse because it was forbidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew Lorenzo had tried once or thrice to convince Dean to kill me and he had refused. Because he feels that I am not a threat to him. But if he should discover that I am a hybrid, it would be the death of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During those days of unending pain, I would drink to stupor or have brutal sex maybe fuck a girl who is having sex for the first time very hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it a gruesome sight? Yes. Did it affect me in any way? Well, yes if you mean pleasure. The scream, the tears, the blood. It gave me pleasure that I could inflict pain on someone too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with lia appearance in my life, everything had changed. Just the sight of her and all my gruesome feelings washed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stare at my laptop in front of me. I can&#39;t believe I am the one doing this. I can&#39;t believe I am the one watching videos of me and her together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I click on the next video. We went out for skating and stopped to have ice cream. I shouted at her when I noticed that she had ice cream on my nose and allowed me to work around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since the last time we made promises to each other, we have been going out more often. Doing things a couple does together including having the best sex every night. Her pants are still on the side of my bed from last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged at my lips at the thought of last night. I made sure she had orgasms like five times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door interrupted my thought. I sit up straight as I try to hide the bulge that is already growing because of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door clicks open and Lia walks in with a smile. I smile back at her even though I have no idea why she is smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is wearing a blue trouser and a white sleeveless top. Her hair is packed into a high ponytail. She is holding my iPad on the other hand as she walks toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leans towards me and places a soft teasing kiss, leaving me begging for more.&#34; I have found the place where I think we should visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roll my eyes. She has been bent on making sure we visit a fancy place or I take her on a date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, I refused because I was still her husband&#39;s cousin. It would make a bad impression if they see us together but after so much persuasion I agree. &#34;Where are we visiting?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile widened with anticipation &#34;Guess&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh &#34; I am not good at guessing lia. Just tell me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just guess Luca. Don&#39;t be such a boring boyfriend &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dominoes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;k&amp;M?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; she replied with a smile clearly enjoining the fact that I was failing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rissa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO!&#34; I roll my eyes. I have mentioned all the popular places in the park. What other place is there to mention?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t tell me it is a magna cinema. We can&#39;t have a date there and I hate watching movies&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, since you could not guess a single puzzle I am going to help you, The Attics Museum!&#34; She shouts with a higher pitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Museum? Why would she pick the Museum of all the places she could think of. I hate the Museum. It reminds me of things I would rather sweep under the closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca! Luca&#34; she calls but her voice sounds far away. She taps my hands, bringing me from my thoughts. &#34;Don&#39;t you like the Museum?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod and shake whatever dreadful feeling that is creeping up my skin. &#34;I am okay with it&#34; I answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiles &#34;I knew you would love it since you have decided that you hate all the fancy restaurants and besides I love the Museum&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And besides I love the Museum. Jenny once said this exact same word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gust of wind filled my room. I furrowed my eyebrows as I looked at the window. The trees outside are calm. Then what is this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aggh!&#34; Lia screamed. I turn around to see Sabrina standing before us. I glare at her as I use my fingers to smooth Lia&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think this could give someone a nightmare? Why would you just appear in front of my room like this?&#34; I ask with a calm angry tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would not visit you like this if it is not urgent,&#34; she says and looks at Lia &#34;Go&#34; she orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my mouth to stop her and tell her that Lia is my girlfriend but she has already run away. She was obviously scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t appreciate you barging into my room unexpectedly,&#34; I say with a bored expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I don&#39;t expect you to kill innocent people for fun?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrow my eyes. &#34;For fun? What are you talking about?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The news is everywhere. A hybrid is killing people. You are the only one of your kind left so why are you doing this?&#34; She asked. Her voice was laced with anger, I am sure if she could kill me she would have done that already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I. I did not kill anyone. Why would I do something as foolish as that?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t seem to wrap my head around the fact that there is another hybrid. Who could it be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh don&#39;t lie to me!&#34; She snaps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallow hard &#34;I am not lying Sabrina. I would never lie to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at me for a while before her expression softened. Seems she has discovered that I wasn&#39;t lying after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you need to be careful. If anyone finds out they would think you are the one and might even execute you&#34; she warns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod but I have to find that hybrid. It cannot be roaming around and hurting us.</p>
