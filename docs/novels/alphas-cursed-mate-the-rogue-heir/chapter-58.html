                <p>Dean POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since the letter I have been having cold feet about letting it go. Not that I love her or anything thing. I would rather die than fall for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she is our Luna. How would our pack feel when they discover that I let her go to someone who killed my mother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let&#39;s not forget the blood bath that would flow if he tried to force Lia away from Luca. I heavy a sigh as I rub my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see the reason why you are getting all worked up about letting her go,&#34; Lorenzo asked. He is currently sitting opposite me in my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He killed my mother. The people would see me as a weak Alpha. When he killed my mum. I did not retaliate publicly I just made sure they sentenced Luca. Giving out my Luna to him would make me look weak,&#34; I explained, even though I knew he was not going to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged. &#34;Well, she is Finn, mate. Are you going to tea two mates apart because of the park&#39;s opinion?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tight smile crept onto my lips &#34;Their opinion is needed they are the wolves whom I am ruling&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat up and narrowed his eyes to mine. &#34;So what do you think we should do?&#34; He asks, his voice laced with a tint of uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged &#34;Don&#39;t know. Maybe ask Luca what is their current plan or maybe ask Lia to reject him&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods slowly with a clenched jaw. He is angry with the arrangement even though I am also angry with the arrangement</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do know that keeping Lia is giving Luca more reason to eliminate you,&#34; he said,d, his voice with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod. Maybe Luca would one day gain the mind to kill me but I don&#39;t think he has that ambition right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca has ambitions, but I doubt if it is for the throne. He has had serval times to kill me but he let me go&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door interrupts our discussion. I groan as I sit upright. Who could that be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; come in&#34; I shout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A guard strolls in and bows &#34;The elders are here to see me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s strange. The elders only summon the Alpha when there is something bad going on. Is there a crop disease or a foretold bad omen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of them?&#34; Lorenzo ask. Of course, he is also as surprised as I am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard nods. &#34;Yes, Beta.&#34; Lorenzo nods and waves his hands, dismissing him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to me. &#34;Why do you think they ask for us?&#34; He asks. He always dreads the council meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw it as a waste of time and the elders were always trying to go through the most peaceful way. Something that Lorenzo found very annoying. He has always loved violence, to him. It is the best way to eliminate something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take in a heavy breath. &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; I stand up and start arranging my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo follows me at my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately we get to the conference hall. They all stand up and bow at me, every single one of them except the power-drunk Sabrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never knew we have two Alphas under one room,&#34; I say as they sit down, glaring at Sabrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She returns it with a smile.  Witches are a pain in the ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me your Highness. Witches are observing a fast. We don&#39;t bow to anyone, and secondly, I do not know why I am here because I am not a member of the council. So, if it pleases the Alpha can you tell me why I am here?&#34; She asked ed, her voice laced with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she is not observing any sort of fast. She just takes pleasure in annoying me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I don&#39;t know. We would wait for Ares to tell us,&#34; I reply, facing Ares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, and I thought the Alpha gets involved in everything that is happening around the people,&#34; she murmur loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glare at her. &#34;Are you suggesting that the Alpha is inattentive about the needs of his people? Enzo asks in a deep, angry voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I don&#39;t know. He is meant to know about everything that happens around us,&#34; she defended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole council remained silent. If it was someone else, their head would be on a spike by now. But it was Sabrina, one enchantment and you are gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand, but I have been busy with more pressing matters,&#34; I defend myself. I would not let her get what she wants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods as if she understands whatever I just said. &#34;Busy with your wife, stabbing, or your cousin,&#34; she replies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curl my hand into a fist. &#34;Tell me, what are you so busy with that you don&#39;t know about the bloodthirsty hybrid who feeds on our wolves, inflicting them with injuries?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? There has been a hybrid lurking around. I thought Enzo was pulling my legs when he told me, and now the best is inflicting injuries on people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit upright and stare at the people waiting for my decision. I have no experience with hybrids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We would find a hunter, and also, I would send troops to surround the pack. They would catch him&#34; I assure them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send strong men. I have heard that once he senses the blood of werewolves, he makes sure he sucks them dry,&#34; Ares explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or we could ask Sabrina to track him down. He has his blood everywhere in the park. That was the reason we invited you, Sabrina. To help us,&#34; Ares says,s, his voice soft with a plead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped Sabrina&#39;s lips. &#34;What would I get in return?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A seat at the council&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waves her hand in the air. &#34;That would pass. Not attractive enough. Only if you allow my people in,&#34; she demands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; Ares replies immediately but keeps quiet when he sees my glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bows his head &#34;Sorry my Alpha. Is .. Is just that the people are scared. Twenty of us have been injured and seven of us died before we could do anything about it. If we let Sabrina in she would help us&#34; he explained trying to make me see reasons with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head. I can&#39;t. The witches had disloyalty in their blood they might turn against us. I can&#39;t be inviting my enemy in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Sabrina, who has a smile on her face. &#34;A seat on the council or nothing,&#34; I tell her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods with a smile &#34;If Luca was offering me this position I would take it. Do you know why? Because he would make a better Alpha than you but if not. It&#39;s time I take my leave&#34; she says as she stands io and leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury burns within me. Did she just imply that I am not good, Alpha?</p>
