                <p>Luca&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I was done immediately. I set my eyes on Lia in the bar where she worked. She didn&#39;t know I existed back then. Nobody knew I was around, not even my uncle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After being sent away for five years I had managed to come back with my full power. To everybody, I was a rogue because when everyone was getting their wolf I was still weak. Like really weak, but with the help of Sabrina I was able to awaken my wolf. Turns out that I am a hybrid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother left me immediately after she gave birth to me because somebody had already found out that she was a vampire. She and my dad did not want another person to discover my secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got to know about this through Sabrina. Then I discovered that Jenny was my mate. She loved me regardless of who I was or my kind. She was the only one who took me for who I was. Then I woke up one morning to discover that she had been killed by one of our bodyguards. When I asked whose orders he said it was Dean</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh!  I  wanted to murder him right there but I could not. He was the crown prince and my uncle would not allow me. So when I heard that the bloodlust park had a rivalry with us, I helped them kill his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Call me fucking wicked but I wanted vengeance. Ever since then my life has been a mess especially when I was sent out of the park. I just wandered around till I met Sabrina who helped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I came back I promised myself to end Dean&#39;s miserable life then I found out about Lia and Merlin who was his son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The obsession to have her crept slowly into my skin and I made up my mind that I was going to have her irrespective of who she was. Be it Dean&#39;s Luna or Finn&#39;s mate,  they could all go to hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if I am being serious I would have fucked her right this instant or called her back to me as I watched her go away but I did not. I had things to attend to. I needed to make sure that Dean remained where he was and most importantly I needed to visit Sabrina or instead send for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curl my hands into a fist as I storm out of his room. I have never been this humiliated. What the hell was his problem? I ask as I bang the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pace around the room wondering what I did round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rings. I look at the caller ID. It&#39;s Lexie. My heart skips a bit as I pick up the call and hope everything is alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pick up the call &#34;Hello Lexie&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone is silent for a while before she picks up. &#34;How are you lia?&#34; She asks me if her voice sounds low or maybe it&#39;s the fear in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am fine. How is Merlin? Is he fine?&#34; I ask her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. But he has a little headache. When will you be coming to see him? He has been asking after you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart dropped at the thought of him asking for him. My mother was not present with me when I was growing up because she was dead but I am alive. My son&#39;s health is meant to come before anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can come and see him today, or now. If he is awake&#34; I reply to her without thinking. All that matters is that my son needs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; She asks me her voice laced with doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. He will be waiting&#34; she says and hangs up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take my bath as I try to wash Luca&#39;s hands or scent from me. I put on my clothes, do a little makeup, and close the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I pass through the gates I am tempted to tell Luca that I am going to see Merlin but after what happened today. I refuse. After all, he does not care about me. What good will it do if I tell him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I make my way toward the car I was gifted at my remating ceremony with Dean. The palace guard don&#39;t even bother stopping me, instead, they bow their heads and leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within thirty minutes I arrive at Lexie&#39;s house. I knock for a while before Lexie opens the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy!&#34; Merlin shouts as he runs to hug me. I squat to his night and engulf him in a tight hug rubbing his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you,&#34; he said in a low voice as he clung to me tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you too&#34; I whispered back to him. We stayed in that position for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spend a lot of time with Lexie and Merlin. Merlin soon fell asleep leaving me and Lexie to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, I bade her goodbye, kissed Merlin on the forehead, and got into my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I entered the car, my muscles stiffened. I felt something was wrong. The car smelt different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A large masculine hand covered my mouth with a handkerchief. I fought hard to remove it but to no avail. Slowly my eyelid became heavy and I closed my eyes. Welcoming myself to darkness once more.</p>
