                <p>Luca placed me carefully on his bed. He stared at me for a while, my heartbeat increased as his dark blue eyes bored into my soul. His eyes dropped to my lips as his eyes darkened. I licked my dry lips. His shoulder tended at my gesture. I prayed within me that he would just put everything behind me and kiss me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck!&#34; He cursed under his breath as his eyes drew from mine. He dropped his head in the crook of my neck. His hot breath fanned my neck, sending shivers down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he touch you?&#34; He asked his head still on my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me lia&#34; he pleaded quietly and planted a soft kiss on my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head carefully, afraid of what he might snap out of this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Words lia, words&#34; he growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but he almost did. &#39;&#39; I answered quietly. He remained quiet, taking in my scent. My body grew warm with anticipation. He started planting kisses from my neck back to my lips. He stopped at the corner of my lips and raised his head a little bit. The space between us was so small that if I raised my head just a little bit his lips would meet with mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our gaze locked with each other screaming a strange feeling of lust, desire, and love. No, not love. We have not even gotten there. He was still angry with me; he was just acting on his impulse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did not want me, he only wanted someone to be his bed even though a feeling within me knew whatever he said was not true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips touched mine as warmth spread through my body. I shivered at how soft his lips felt on mine. How could I get over these soft lips? His tongue lingered around my lips for a while begging for entrance. I parted my lips slightly and he rushed inside roughly filled with a mixture of lust and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrapped my arms around his neck and snaked my hands around his hair, he groaned as my hands grappled his air. Then he stopped, and I could feel the tension rising. His breathing reduced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he stood up immediately, a cold laced my body replacing the warmth that I had felt earlier on. I groaned in frustration as I sat up. He stared at me intensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hurt?&#34; He asked with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am fine,&#34; I replied curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An awkward silence existed between us. He just sat on his table, his eyes fixed on me. I just looked at him with expectation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his words started repeating himself before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would risk my life for a maid as long as I could get her on my bed anytime I wanted. Gentlemen are normally kind to people, put that at the back of your mind the next time you decide to mistake kindness for love or lust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just being kind. I repeated in my mind. I searched around in case I had forgotten something. I had to go before he would shamelessly order me to get out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him once more &#34;Thank you&#34; I mumbled and stood up to leave his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you think you are going to go?&#34; He asked stopping me on my track. What was he expecting? For me to wait till he rubbed it off on my face that I was an whore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am going before you ask me to get out. Just preserving my little dignity&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard before his eyes landed on mine. His eyes softened with remorse &#34;I was angry and you know it&#34; he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged &#34;Oh really. It seems the men in the Attics family always spilled out things when they were angry. Whether it be his cousin or the Alpha himself&#34; he glared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I had annoyed him with whatever I just said but I was tired of being tossed around and each cousin calling me a whore. The only difference was that Dean outrightly called me a whore, while Luca indirectly called me a whore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t ever compare me to Dean because we are not the same,&#34; he warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I maintained eye contact with him. &#34;Oh really, because the last time I checked. He directly called me a whore while you indirectly called me one. The bottom line is that the both of you don&#39;t respect me, you just see me as a tool to use against your cousin while he sees me as a common piece that he can easily rape!&#34; I shouted at his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have had you a long time ago if I was Dean, trust me&#34; he replied with some sort of pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger mixed with frustration welled up within me. &#34;Then what is stopping you? I asked with a daring tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I seriously did not know what I was doing, one minute I was angry and the next minute I was daring him to bed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up making me stare at him, he pointed at my chest with his middle finger and for some reason, just the idea of his middle finger trapped in between my chest warmed me up. &#34;You, lia. You. Until you choose me I am not going to lay my hands on you no matter how hard I want to&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped backward to take in his words. There was no time hiding it or thinking about it &#34;I chose you&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of joy passed through his eyes before he replaced it with a frown &#34;You are saying this because you are horny&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Luca. I mean every bit of what I just said. I have always wanted you&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I expected him to reply to me back or kiss me or take me to bed and fuck me till I lose my voice instead he asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head &#34;I mean what do you want to do with Dean who almost raped you?&#34; He explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrenaline rushed within me at the thought of what would have happened if he was not here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him back, this time my voice was filled with determination. &#34;I want his head&#34;</p>
