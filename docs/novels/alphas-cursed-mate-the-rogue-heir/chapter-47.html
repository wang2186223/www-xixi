                <p>Lia pov.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed to get home after Luca and I disagreed. I have never seen him this angry. The fact that he left me on the road explained how angry he was at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I opened my room door I pulled my clothes off and fell on the bed. My thoughts wandered back to what would have happened if Benedicta had not come in to save Merlin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes to part for Lexie&#39;s safety. She is a very sweet girl and does not deserve any of the stress I have put her through as a friend. Gosh! I need to get her out of Lorenzo&#39;s mind. He might come back for her later when I am not around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when I was about to sleep a knock came. Knock! Knock! Knock!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned as I raised my tired body to open the door. Maybe it was Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my door to reveal my maid. She stood at the front of the door carrying some clothes with her head bowed &#34;My lady may I come in&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I seriously wanted to close the door and sleep but then again it was not her fault. I stepped aside and watched her drop the clothes on my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just clothes but royal decorative material with brackets and other royal things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the occasion?&#34; I asked her as she separated the items on my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, Luna,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who sent you?&#34; I asked with a stern voice. How would she say she did not know about the event? The maids were the first to get wind of any gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards her calmly trying to detect if she was lying through her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Alpha asked the cooks to cook for a feast but we do not know what it&#39;s for. He has invited the whole park and he seems to be in a happy mood. That&#39;s all I know ma&#34;  she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a good look at her, from her toes which were decorated with scandals to her hair which was packed in a bun. She bent her head down shyly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go,&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and hastily left. I walked towards my bed. I picked up the purple velvet gown that he bought for me. It had red embroidery around the edges. It came with a gold crown and a black shoe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe if I asked Luca he would have an answer even though I knew that the probability of knowing was little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe I  just wanted to talk to him. To see if he was still angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on his door twice before he opened. Immediately he saw that I was the one his face changed into a frown and my heart dropped immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; He asked so loudly that I grew cold feet. Was he this angry? He surely cannot blame me at all times when whenever I started getting close to him he would drop my hopes immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to see you, &#39;&#39;I replied quietly. He glared at me for a while before letting me in. I gasped at the sight of his room. Clothes were scattered everywhere, drawers flung open and luggage on top of his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you packing?&#34; I asked. My voice sounded almost like a whisper. Was he leaving me? Just like that? That means if I had not come to his room he would have gone without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it look like I am doing?&#34; He asked as he folded more of his clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you did not bother telling me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rolled his eyes, one of his hands rested on his waist while the other rubbed his head. Irritation filled his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why should I tell you? Are you my wife or my lover?&#34; He asked, shattering my heart once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would have stayed in my room and just wallowed in self-pity till sleep took over me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, I came here expecting him to do what? Beg me? Because he gave me some heads and kissed me a few times or told me he loved me even though I was his cousin&#39;s wife. Someone he despised so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears filled my eyes. I took in a deep shaky breath as I tried to stop the tears from falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me and his eyes softened for a while before they retook the dark eyes &#34;If you came here to cry please. leave &#34; he ordered with a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gathered whatever dignity I had left and walked towards the door. Just as I was about to open the door he called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lia,&#34; he called softly. I paused for a while, and my heartbeat quickened. I could feel his eyes boring into the back of my neck as he made his way towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goosebumps filled my skin as warmth crept within me. What was he going to do? What was he going to say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Turn around&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was meant to be angry and stand my ground. You can&#39;t just treat me like trash and expect me to fall at his feet whenever he needs someone to warm his bed. But I foolishly turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned towards me and pressed my body against it till there was no space left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me with warm blue eyes, and my heartbeat fastened. His masculine Cologne filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be gone for a few days. Just make sure you are safe&#34; he said quietly and pecked me on my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me for a while before he stepped backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have this whole time to make up your mind,&#34; he said in a more pleading voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. I opened my mouth to say something. Say I would willing to choose him over everything but I closed it and left</p>
