                <p>Lia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hate working in restaurants. Male wolves hungry to defile anyone weak usually filled it. My case was worse. I had no wolf. It meant I could not even fight them whenever they tried to take advantage of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to Lexie and Adrian, they were always there to protect me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lexie and I arrived, we found the restaurant already filled with customers. We passed through the back door to avoid questions from our boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are late,&#34; Adrian whispered, standing between the both of us as we dished out orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We know but we are here now, so can you go back to your work while we mind our work?&#34; Lexie asked with a stern voice. She hated Adrian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, he was just another wolf waiting for the right time to have his way with me and she had to protect me since I had a soft heart. What she did not know was that Adrian had a crush on her, but he kept it to himself, afraid of her rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was harsh,&#34; I whispered to her immediately after he left. She heaved a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was not a harsh lie. He always is. around can&#39;t you see that he is no different from others? He wants to take advantage of you,&#34; she said, her voice laced with concern. I picked up the plate that contained a customer&#39;s order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has it ever occurred to you that he might want you and not me?&#34; I said and walked past without waiting for another word. I looked at the order number and the people who sat at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my grip on the tray as I approached Dimitri and his friend. Dimitri raised his head and watched me coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, here she comes,&#34; he told his friends. They followed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my grip the more my knuckles were already white from nervousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a wolf-less girl on the bed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dimitri asked his friend as I set the plate down carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, imagine the pleasure you would get from fucking a girl without a wolf?&#34; he added with a dirty smirk. They all laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my head to see Lexie staring at them with anger. I shook my head negatively, I could protect myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damien watched me as I saw them. He sipped his wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you are mistaken. It&#39;s fucking a human. Sometimes I wonder why the moon goddess would decide to make someone without a wolf. It&#39;s a waste of time and space,&#34; Damien said with a hint of sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are created to satisfy us,&#34; Damien answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think, lia?&#34; I halted, trying to control whatever anger I was feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Satisfy us in bed. It would be a mark that you are not as useless as you seem,&#34; he said, and they started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard and poured the last wine into a glass, without thinking I poured the wine on its face, I took the remaining bottle and poured the whole content on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sick bastard!&#34; I muttered before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They watched me surprised that I stood up for myself for the first time. &#34;You did a great job, lia. I&#39;m proud&#34; Lexie said as she rushed to my side after dropping the empty tray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think the boss would fire me? I disgraced a customer in front of the others&#39;&#39; The boss already hated me for refusing to sleep with him. Imagine how he would feel if he found out that I did such a disgraceful thing&#34; I added amidst tiny sobs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey look at me&#34; she commanded softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have a wolf, it doesn&#39;t mean you are weak or you deserve all that they are doing to you. You should be proud of yourself. You stood up for yourself&#34; she said as she rubbed my shoulders. With time the sniffing stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyways have you heard?&#34; she asked me with excitement, her face laced with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heard what?&#34; &#34;The king is looking for his son&#39;s mate. Alpha Dean. He wants all the Mateless wolf to come to his place this Saturday&#34; she said and watched my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And?&#34;I asked, knowing she was not done with her announcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I want you to come with me.&#34; I shook my head negatively. I raised my brows with a sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have a wolf Lia, I am wolf-less. What makes you think the moon goddess would bless the Alpha with a curse like me?&#39;&#39;I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please, the moon goddess can decide to give you an Alpha since she took your wolf and besides you can come because of me there would be fun,&#34; she said softly giving me puppy eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There would be games and wine, you know. We could get drunk and besides I can&#39;t leave you alone with them,&#34; she said referring to Dimitri and his friend and the other men who wanted to take advantage of me. I was touched by her concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to go but It was a weekend and I was meant to spend it with Merlin , my son. And I could not tell her that I had a son. It was meant to remain a secret between me and the witches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t,&#34; I whispered slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, for my sake,&#34; she added. I rolled my eyes and heaved a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay fine. I would come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you!&#34; She said, giving me a hug. I hugged her back and left. I walked towards the toilet and closed the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything this week was just so complicated, I promised my son that I would spend more time with him, I promised Lexie that I would go to one Alpha mating event with her and I was quite sure that I would lose my job immediately the boss found out what I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used the restroom and stood over the sink splashing water on my face. I looked in the mirror to see Dimitri standing behind me with a scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I asked turning to look at him. I tightened my hands around my trousers. Within a split second, my body was slammed flat against the wall, his hands tightened around my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dim..itri leave me alone,&#34; I said amidst breath. Contrary to my request his hands tightened around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, let me make this clear. You are only alive because it is forbidden for a wolf to kill a fellow wolf and know this. You are weak. Useless. &#34; He growled his eyes already turning gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t tell me I will be killed by Dimitri in the toilet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The next time you try what you did. I will make you and whoever you love pay for it&#34; he said and leaned closer as he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And contrary to what everyone thinks. I am sure you have a deep dark secret.&#34; My heart sank as my son&#39;s innocent face flashed before me. He drifted back and released me from his grip. I exhaled loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone has a secret,&#34; he said with a smirk and left. It took a while for me to stabilize my breath. I rearranged my clothes and went back to the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I entered and my gaze fell on Dave, my boss. &#34;Lia, you are fired immediately. Go home!&#34; He ordered in a dismissive tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes met with Damien and I glared at him. He returned it with a smirk. These people were going to pay dearly for this.</p>
