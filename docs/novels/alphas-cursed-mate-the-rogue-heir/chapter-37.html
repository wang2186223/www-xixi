                <p>Dean&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced around the room trying to unveil whatever she was hiding and who could be a hybrid. Hybrids are more powerful than wolves and they sometimes turn into tyrants and decide to challenge the throne. The fact that she has decided to wipe Lorenzo&#39;s memory means that the person can be of harm to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if I don&#39;t get her on my side it will be worse and I will never get to know about her plans or who the hybrid is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner than later I settle down to face more pressing problems such as the administration of the pack and how I am going to have a second chance mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock came on my door interrupting my work. I am sure it is Lorenzo. I had sent someone to knock on his door but he had refused to reply, meaning he wanted to be left alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in&#34; I shouted, my attention still fixed on the paper in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My lord, Sabrina is here&#34; he informs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrow my eyebrows, what the hell is she doing here? I had not sent for her. I shrug, let me hear whatever she wants to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her in&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard nods his head and leaves. A few minutes later Sabrina walks in with a smile on her face, an expression I am beginning to find annoying. How can you be evil and keep on smiling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She takes a seat without me asking her to sit. My face turns into a frown as I stare at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, Sabrina?&#34; I ask. &#34;I don&#39;t remember sending for you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugs and picks up a pen on my desk &#34;Well I did not think that there would be a need to inform my ally that I am coming to see him&#34; she says</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are not yet allies, Sabrina and I don&#39;t think we will ever be&#34; I warn her,   her over-familiarity is beginning to itch my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile washes away immediately and it is replaced with a frown. &#34;What do you mean?&#34; She asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard me Sabrina, I said I would think about your proposal&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swallowed whatever lump was in her throat and sat upright, her hands placed on my table and I resisted the urge to remove her hands. &#34;What do you say about my proposal?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pack up all the paper, close my laptop, and walk toward her side. I sit on the edge of the table beside her. &#34;I will only agree on one condition&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You tell me who is the hybrid who bit Lorenzo&#34; I reply with a deep note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She furrowed her eyebrows ``And how am I meant to know who that is?&#34; She asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My muscles tighten as I try to control the anger that is growing within me. How can she look me in the eyes and play dumb?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lorenzo can&#39;t remember the person who bit him and according to him he said its memory faded when you looked at him&#34;  I explained to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stares at me keenly for a long period and it is becoming creepy. My frown deepened &#34;Why are you staring at me?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugs and leans against the chair &#34;Do you remember what we last discussed?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, nothing. I was just wondering how my eyes remove someone&#39;s memory. I mean that question should be directed at you supernaturals. Wolves and vampires are the ones who can erase memory. Not a witch like me.  Witches walk with charms and most of the time the charms can&#39;t work if I don&#39;t do some incarnation. Did you see me doing any incarnation?&#34; She asks with a raised eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth immediately ran dry. I opened my mouth to reply but closed it back. I know she is trying to deceive me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lorenzo can&#39;t lie&#34; I reply with a firm voice depicting my trust in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled a little bit. &#34;Is this a way to refuse my alliance?&#34;  she asks with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door burst open. Lorenzo entered inside. Immediately he sees Sabrina, his face turning into a frown as he glares at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sabrina turned to him with a smile &#34;Oh Lorenzo, I heard you claimed I removed your memory&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo looks at me with the thought that it was meant to be between us. I shrugged, I mean what did he expect me to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. You wiped my memory about the hybrid&#34; he replied, shooting me with a death glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh, how are you sure that it was a hybrid that bit you? Why do you think I would want to erase a memory of a hybrid?&#34; She asks with a calculated calmness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. You always have personal ambition Sabrina and even if you can deceive Dean you can&#39;t deceive me&#34; he replied the last part with a deep warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flashes through her eyes &#34;I saved your friend and for some reason, you think I want your downfall&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo rolled his eyes as he tried to control whatever anger he was feeling. &#34;Sabrina, an alliance with you is impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turns to me &#34; Are you going to let your beta make decisions for you?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Lorenzo who is staring at me with a dare-devil eye. I walk back to my chair and stare at the two options before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An alliance with Sabrina would have been a good option but witches can&#39;t be trusted and for all I know it could be the hybrid who sent her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are not going to become your ally, Sabrina. My father ruled the kingdom without witches and it was -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; It was a failed reign. Your mother died even when he knew magic could cure her. People were sacrificed for no reason because they were sorcerers, something he knew they were born with. Is that how you want to rule?  As a tyrant?&#34; she asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clear my throat &#34;Well I would rather be feared than have anything to do with witches&#34; I reply to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An eerie smile creeps into her lip. &#34; You are as pathetic as your father &#34;she replied and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; You will regret this?&#34; she replied, glaring at me and Lorenzo and banging the door at us.</p>
