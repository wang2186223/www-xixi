                <p>Luca pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a message for you,&#34; Sabrina said smiling at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Dean and Lorenzo. They both had raised eyebrows on their faces as they scanned Sabrina&#39;s face, trying to detect what was wrong. Why would she be here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat up, facing her. &#34;Go on,&#34; I said with a tone of nonchalance. Trying my best to convey to her that she could say anything before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at them and then at the office. She walked around the office, her heels making a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;serious?&#34; She asked with a raised eyebrow, her voice deepened with anger as she glared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. She plastered a smile on her face and continued walking around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice decor,&#34; she said in an overly bored tone. I rolled my eyes in return. She has been to the place before. Why would she be saying that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh &#34;sigh. Sabrina, you have been here before. Don&#39;t you think that is an unnecessary compliment?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped and smiled at me, then used her fingers to caress the shelves. And don&#39;t you think it is foolish of you to join hands with your enemy?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean&#39;s nostrils flared. He had never liked Sabrina right from time. &#34;We are one now,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle escaped her lips. &#34;Why?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean opened his mouth to talk but she shunned him &#34;Oh, I know the reason. Jenny is back, so everyone is back to being friends. Right?&#34; She asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean curled his hands into a fist on the table. This was the reason he hated witches. If it was a wolf talking to him like that, the wolf would have been dead before saying the next word. But Sabrina was a witch. The highest witch in the pack. She can never be tamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get. Out&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at him and turned to me. &#34;Come with me,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at them and at her. Lorenzo nodded his head in acceptance and I left with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She strolled towards my room and closed the door behind her as soon as I entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the meaning of that?&#34; I asked, feigning ignorance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the meaning of what you just portrayed in the Dean&#39;s office? How did Dean form an alliance with you?&#34; She asked, her voice deep with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved from the door I was leaning on to my bed. &#34;Jenny is back. It means that there is no need to hold Dean responsible for her death. So I decided it&#39;s time we go back to the way we were before Jenny came,&#34; I replied. I knew she would be angry with me for becoming friends with Dean after what he did to me, but I also wronged him. I also tried to kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved towards me, her veins throbbing by her neck as she tried to curtail her anger. She bent towards me, glaring at me for a while before taking a calm breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me remind you about your life before Jenny came. You were a rogue and were occasionally mocked by Dean and Lorenzo. In fact, they insulted you in front of the entire pack. While you took it as a joke, they gradually mocked you before everyone&#39;s eyes. Everyone knew you as a weak rogue and when you found your mate, he became jealous. He mocked your affair and advised you to leave her whenever you and Jenny quarreled only for him to jump back to her bed the moment you were gone and when you tried to attack him. Lorenzo told you to loosen up and that she was just a girl while you and I know that if anything were to happen to his mate. When the time came to choose sides, he chose Dean&#39;s side not because he likes Dean more but because it is safer. Dean tried killing you so many times, all in the name of Lia and you, and I know that he doesn&#39;t love her that much, and let&#39;s not forget that Lorenzo attacked you when you tried to save Lia. I was the one who rescued you. Now that Jenny is back, do you think she is back because she missed you?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think she would choose you over the opportunity of becoming a  Luna? choose You are a hybrid! Luca! a hybrid! But they have looked down on you for so long, calling you a rogue. You are a hybrid! Be a hybrid and not a rogue! Be as cunning as Jenny and Dean and as wise as Lorenzo. Don&#39;t ever make the mistake of trusting them and I thought you loved Lia? She asked in a hoarse voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard. &#34;I do,&#34; I replied in a deep voice. With Jenny around I have not thought about Lia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. &#34;No, you don&#39;t,&#34; she said, her voice filled with disappointment and blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do! You know I love her, but she left me! She left me for Finn. She just walked away even though I told her to stay,&#34; I retorted. I can&#39;t believe she is the one blaming me. I sacrificed a lot for Lia. Gave up my identity for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay? Stay with a man who has a mate. A man who hugged his mate passionately?&#34; She asked in a sarcastic tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nostrils flared as I curled my hand. &#34;You were not there&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, I was. I saw it. What is the use of my magic if not to use it for my advantage&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled sharply. So she knew. Why was she blaming me? I pinched the bridge of my nose.,&#34; &#34;Sabrina, okay, fine. You have blamed me for all you want. What do I do? And since you are omniscient, why is Jenny here?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile of satisfaction tugged her lips. Of course, she loved being acknowledged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Firstly, always put lia first. And Jenny, never trust her. She does not seem pure. Make sure no one knows about your ability,&#34; she warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded even though I was disappointed because she did not know what Jenny wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to say something but shut it when a knock interrupted our conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you expecting someone?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged &#34;I am a Royal. I am always needed&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face changed into a frown as she pointed at me. &#34;Be careful,&#34; she warned and walked towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed her back to see who was at the door. My face turned into a frown when I saw Jenny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously? Can I be left alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sabrina looked at me with a warning gaze and left me to my ex-mate.</p>
