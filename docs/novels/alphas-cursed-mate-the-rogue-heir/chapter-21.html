                <p>Lia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Dean stabbed Luca with the white oak, being the Alpha he was the only one who could drag the oak away. It therefore means that Luca will not be away for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks at me with an evil grin &#34;Now no one can rescue you&#34; It seems as if he has evil plans against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he going to do?  Ask me if I was Finn&#39;s mate. Of course, I am going to deny it. I looked at Sasha who had a grin on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blood boils with anger, and I clench my fist to restrain myself from what I am going to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take her,&#34; he orders me. My eyes meet Lorenzo and his usual blank look. God help them if they do something stupid. I would tell them how I feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards grab my hands and take me out of the room. They throw me into a dark stinky room and chain my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately know that I am going to go through hell.  They did not bring me before the court which means they are not going to kill me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit on the ground for a while, and my mind travels back to Merlin my child, he must have missed me. I can&#39;t imagine that I have not been in this palace for up to a month and I am already passing through hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gate opened, and a familiar smell hit my nose. It&#39;s Dean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the guards turned on the light and brought a chair for him and his beta Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glare at them, and they return it with blank faces. I wonder why he went in with the coronation after he knew I was not his mate. I just pray Merlin does not have his characters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clears his throat. A maid enters inside with a bowl of pepper, and a whip soaked into it. Fear grips me at the thought of what they are about to do to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t tell me they are going to use that whip on me. I close my eyes as tears fall. If Luca was here he would not let this happen. I am suddenly happy that Merlin was not brought to the palace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would keep his birth a secret till I die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the tears? Are you already imagining what we are going to do to you?  he asks with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raise my face to look at him, my hands still chained to the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I ask him, my eyes bloodshot from tears and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to know why you decided to keep my father&#39;s killer within the pack?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not see Finn. I do not know Finn&#34; I answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He signals to the guard. He takes the pepper-soaked whip and whips my back once. I close my eyes as my back explodes in pain. The pain is so raw, it gets into my brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well if you must know Finn is your mate. The one you let into your bedroom&#34; he answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wish I had told  Finn to take me with him, this nonsense would have not happened but then I would have not been able to see my son or tell Luca or Benedicta goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only person that came to my room was Luca&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo chuckled &#34;So you have finally accepted that you are offering your body to your husband&#39;s cousin&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger mixed with pain rushed within me.  He was always walking at the back of Dean like a slave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes as I suck in all the pain &#34;One, I  did not offer my body to Luca. He is my friend, it is not my fault that he has a heart that you don&#39;t have. And as for people who sleep around, why don&#39;t you ask your friend? Or-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I complete the sentence a loud thud sounds across the room. Dean had just slapped me.  I taste metal on my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No man has ever slapped me. In that instance,  I vow to never be quiet or succumb to their laws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; The next time you call me a name like that I will give your body to the lions to feed on&#34; he warns me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curse him under my breath, and another whip lands on my back this time it is twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah,h I scream in pain. One thing I know for sure is that I have a long way to go and it is not like they are going to release me anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body starts becoming weak as my wolf growls slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Finn your mate or not?&#34; He asks me as he sits down back in his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the dog your mate or not?&#34; I retorted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He furrowed his eyebrow as he narrowed his eyes ``Did you just ask me if I have a dog as a mate?&#34; He asks as he lowers his height to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am weak,  really weak but I would not let him see my weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know because you rejected your first mate and the moon goddess has refused to remate you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He curls his hands into a fist and drives it into my face. I groan in pain. The worst thing is that I cannot do anything because I am chained,  not like I have the strength though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know what your mate did? He killed my father. He killed the Alpha of your pack. I could banish you for harboring an enemy in your room&#34; he asks, his voice cold like steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then banish me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled and shook his head. &#34;That will be too easy. I will.make.you. pay&#34;  he says pointing towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stands up and so does Lorenzo. &#34;Give her twelve strokes,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard nodes and bows his head as he leaves. They start whipping me with the pain gushing through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept on counting until it got to twelve. I writhe in pain, as fresh wounds open up and the pain worsens with the pepper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They release my hands and legs. I am grateful that they would leave me alone to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then they lift me, taking me to where I do not know.</p>
