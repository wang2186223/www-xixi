                <p>&#34;your father just died and besides the doctor said I need bed rest. Right?&#34; I ask the doctor. The last thing I want to do is to go to that hell hole.</p>

                <p>&#34;you have been unconscious for three days&#39; &#39;he informs me with a disgusted face. &#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; he says. I walk down slowly. When he discovers that I don&#39;t have enough strength he carries me over his shoulder as pain grips me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately we get to the car he throws me into the seat and slams the door against me. My skin is still red from the pepper that was rubbed on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He enters the car through the other door and slams it against himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roll my eyes. Does he always have to be this grumpy? Maybe if he showed me a little mercy, I would not fulfill the moon goddess&#39; wish but how did she expect me to end his reign?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are having my father&#39;s burial ceremony this evening. So get dressed. Put on something appropriate &#34;he ordered me. His attention is on his iPad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head in understanding when he says something appropriate it means something that will cover my body marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We soon reached the palace. Immediately the car stopped at the palace and my face turned white. My lips start trembling. I press it tight to keep it from trembling. The Alpha would not see me fall apart. Never!.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the dreadful memories associated with this night rush back to my head. From the day I made my mistake by entering into the palace. To my rejection, every time I was humiliated and dejected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I searched around for Luca. If they are going to bury his uncle he should have released him by now. Dean would surely know how dear his father was to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if Dean read my mind he says&#34;If you are looking for your lover, he is not here&#34; Dean says with a mocking tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glare at him. He smiles and looks forward &#34;Glare at me all you want but he will remain there for a very long time. After all you don&#39;t even know where he is kept,&#34; he says with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my mouth to ask him why but instead &#34;It&#39;s no use talking to you&#34; I murmur enough for him to hear me and walk away. I can feel his glare at the back of my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk into my room and slam the door against me. My nostrils flare with anger. I quickly take my bath and put on new clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes as I think of ways to escape from the palace to see my son without the guards following me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I ponder on my way out, sleep eludes me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door interrupted my sleep. I roll over to the other side of the bed and check the time. It is already five o&#39;clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in&#34; I shouted as I sat upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sasha enters with a smile, my face grows red with anger as I see her. What is she doing here? She dared to show herself after what she did to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled as she closed the door. &#34;Oh my Luna I came to get you ready for the party&#34; she answered in a mocking tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stare at her face as I think about a thousand ways to kill her without anyone noticing. I still had the gun that Finn gave me under my pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could just bring it out and waste her disdainful life but that would make Dean punish me again. And I have to be around to be able to plan his downfall. However, I make it a note that as he is dying she will die with him and so will that twat called Lorenzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drop it so I can dress up by myself&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied with a smile &#34;Of course my Luna you can dress up by yourself. No one is going to dress you up but the king has particularly instructed me to make sure you dress up and put on the best makeup&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hiss and stand up and I look at the mirror &#34;Best makeup indeed. Why don&#39;t you just leave me and go and fuck him&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled shyly, a blush appearing on her face &#34;Oh, that is only done at night. But I am not sure you know after all he has never touched you&#34; and paused for a while &#34;.He is very good in bed&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile &#34;of course. I have been there before you came&#34; I told her with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one knows that I have slept with Dean or had a child for him except for Luca. And Luca has promised me his secrecy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit down on the chair &#34;Come and give me makeup meant for a Luna and not for a prostitute&#34; I say and turn to her and watch as her face turns red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of silence exists between both of us for a while and I am grateful for that. Until she opens her mouth to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Luna. You should not be deceived by the title. You might be Luna but I hold his heart. Just imagine all the pain you passed through because I testified against you.&#34; She whispers into my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger rushed through me but I replaced it with a smile. I stay silent and watch as she finishes my makeup with a triumphant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stands up and walks toward the door when I stop her &#34;You should not be so assured about his intention. You are a whore to him. If you should learn something from me, you should learn that Dean does not care about anyone. Now get out &#34;I ordered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face turns red as she opens her mouth to talk &#34; I said get.out.&#34; she curls her hand into a fist and slams the door on me.</p>
