                <p>Luca POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I kicked Jenny out of my room. Satisfaction filled my body. I could do as I please now. Sleep and think of Lia. I seriously wanted to message her or call her to check how she was coping without me, but because she was with her mate, so I let it be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay on my bed staring at the ceiling. Everything reminded me of her from my pillow scent that intoxicated my nostrils with her scent to how she had arranged my room last night. After shouting at me for being careless. My eyes scanned my room. I looked like a mess without her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened revealing one of our palace maids. I furrowed my eyebrow and she entered inside, bowing her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked in a sharp tone. I seriously wanted to be left alone for just a minute or two without being called or the witches visiting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately knelt crying, an action that surprised me. &#34;Why are you on your knees? What happened&#34; I asked with a concerned voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her palms together to look at me. Tears rolling down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t punish me; my mother was sick, and that was why I could not clean the room this morning.&#34; She pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh of relief. I nodded, no wonder the room looked dirty. Although it reminded me of the way things were before she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem. You can come back tomorrow&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you please, I would love to clean the room today. The Luna asked me to clean the room before she came back&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of the luna, my heart melted. She still managed to order people to take care of me even in her absence. If that&#39;s what she wanted then it was okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the key to Lia&#39;s room and left the room. &#34;Once you are done, knock in the room next to mine&#34; I instructed. She nodded and I closed the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entered Lia&#39;s room and closed my eyes for a moment to allow her scent to caress me. Pain bottled up in my chest with the thought of her being with another man. Jealousy filled me; I did not want her to be with someone else and talk more about Finn. If I had my way she would be with me and me alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t imagine life without her. I can&#39;t imagine someone taking that beautiful body or claiming her strawberry-scented lip. The reality did not just make sense to me. For a moment, just a moment I allowed myself to be mad. I allowed her laughter to smooth my skin, and sooner than later, the laughter became almost real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raked my hand on my hair as a curse escaped my lips. I can&#39;t believe the fact that I could feel for someone like this. I was in pain when Jenny left but the pain I felt now could not be compared to the one I felt when Jenny left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jenny left, I sought comfort by sleeping outside and having a buckthorn, but I could not imagine any other girl taking my dick as she did. Could not imagine myself fitting into a hole that did not belong to her. It was as If she was made for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything seemed destroyed: my evening rituals, my sex life, everything. I would go back to my normal routine or perhaps my new routine would be to visit Merlin and Benedicta. He saw me as a father and I have grown a bond with him. Sometimes I forget that he was not my child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid knocked on the door drawing me back from my thoughts. Immediately she told me that she was done. I immediately walked past my room to play her Lana del Rey song. Can&#39;t imagine I am seeking solace in something I once hated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entered the room and searched for my phone to play her favorite music. Anything to remind me of her. I checked my pocket for my phone but I could not find it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was strange because my phone was always in my pocket. I searched around for my phone but I could not find it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where could my phone be? But I saw it a minute before I left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or was it in Lia&#39;s room? No, I went with nothing. I scattered the neatly arranged room irritation and frustration itching my skin and every part of my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it struck me that the only person who entered my room aside from me was the maid. Could she have stolen the phone? But why would she still have the phone if she had no use for it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it dawned on me. Those twats were the ones who sent her. They had to be the one. So after the offer they still had ulterior motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I marched towards their office and opened the door without knocking. Courtesy be damned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I opened the door. Dean&#39;s eyes widened with fear confirming my suspicion. I scanned the room with my eyes searching for my phone. My eyes landed on Lorenzo&#39;s hands. His breathing seized immediately when he saw me. He was with my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bloody twat had tried to steal for me. He murmured something that sounded distant to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the phone from him and turned to Dean, furry blinded my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is either you tell me who sent this, or I turn my back against the both of you, and trust me, it would not be fun,&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean swallowed hard. &#34;Luca.. We need to talk. We wanted to..&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We wanted to do what!?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wanted to talk to Lia&#39;s through you?&#34; Lorenzo revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrow. &#34;What do you want with Lia?&#34; I directed the question at Dean.</p>
