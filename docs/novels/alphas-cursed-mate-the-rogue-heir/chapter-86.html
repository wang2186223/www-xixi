                <p>Luca POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell! I muttered. How did the hybrid get to their house? Hope he did not harm Merlin in any way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the time. It was already ten O&#39;clock. I can&#39;t be outside by this time, but I needed to know if Merlin was okay. I had made a vow to Lia that I was going to protect her son and I had to protect him. He looked up at me as a dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately after I closed the door, I dialed Benedicta&#39;s number. It rang twice before she picked it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca&#34; she called in a whisper. Her voice shook with great fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; I asked. If the hybrid was still lurking around them, I would be there in a minute. My conscience would hurt me forever if anything happened to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. He almost took Merlin, but Luca, I did a spell that prevented him from entering. He has been attacking another household&#34; she said in a low, fearful voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear gripped my heart at the thought of Merlin. How would he feel hearing people&#39;s bone cracking? It would be a great nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran my hand around my hair and pinched the bridge of her nose. &#34;I am so scared,&#34; she whispered in a trembling voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! I muttered. Benedicta was a great witch, almost as great as Sabrina. If she was scared, that meant it was horrific.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that mummy?&#34; Merlin&#39;s little voice asked from afar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s Luca,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy?&#34; He munched, something I could not make out of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart beat fastened at the thought of how he had named me his dad even though Lia kept telling him I was not his dad. This was why I would never get over Lia. She left her presence around me. If it was not her scent on my pillow, it was her Lana del Rey song that she downloaded on my phone, and if it was not that, it was Merlin and the times we spent together like a family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Benedicta answered. &#34;Should I give him the phone?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I answered without hesitation. A minute later, Merlin pressed the phone against his ear as he complained to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, there is a man here. He is sort of scary. He has Golden&#39;s eyes and is lurking around. Everyone is screaming. He tried touching me, but I screamed and she saved me. I was calling my mother, but there was no answer. Do you know where she is?&#34; He inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain was bottled around my chest. A child-like Merlin should not be made to suffer this much. Lia was meant to be with him or at least take him with her. Give some silly excuse. Anything because he wanted closure. He seemed the closure of his Mother more than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was I going to tell him that his mother was far away in another pack doing god knows what with her new mate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wiped my face with my hand. &#34;Mummy is not well, and she is sleeping, but she will talk with you tomorrow morning, okay? Don&#39;t be too angry at her. When it is dawn, I will visit you,&#34; I promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Goodnight&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight,&#34; I answered back as the line switched off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fell on my bed, my eyes staring at the ceiling. How did my life become this messy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning came quicker than expected, maybe because my night was filled with wet dreams of Lia. As a result, I woke up with a boner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was not what woke me up. It was the wailing and screaming of people from afar that woke me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned as I rolled out of bed to meet them. What the hell was wrong with them? what had happened again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone knocked on the door and I opened it, only to see Jenny standing before me. Ordinarily, I would have shouted at her or even insulted her, but she was trembling, her skin pale with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jenny, what is wrong?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately engulfed me in a hug. Okay, that is kind of strange and uncalled for. But I did not say anything, instead I circled my arm around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jenny, what is wrong?&#34; I asked in a little sharp tone. My body was already getting irritated at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are so scary,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows backed myself from the hug and looked at her. &#34;What is so scary?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The bodies, the hybrid. They are all scary&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank at the mention of the hybrid, and my mind flashed back to my call with Merlin yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodies. The hybrid! That means he killed a lot of people. What the hell did he want? Who could this hybrid be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What bodies?&#34; I asked, feigning ignorance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They brought different bodies. Bodies of children and men. Some were injured and others were dead. I heard their scream from the guest room yesterday. I was really scared,&#34; she murmured, her body still trembling. This is the first time I have seen Jenny scared since she got back. She had been fearless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They brought some to the palace,&#34; she informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jenny is okay. He is not going to hurt you?&#34; I promised, and I removed myself from her embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked back into my room picked a shirt and walked towards the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped as I stared at the bodies. The hall was filled with people crying and weeping. What the fuck! I muttered as I stared at the bodies and blood oozing from their body. soaking the thick carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes moved to Dean and Lorenzo. Dean was sitting on his chair with Lorenzo by his side wearing a scared expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman screamed from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father&#39;s reign was not like this; he managed to kill every blood of thirty hybrids. It is either you find a solution or you leave&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know you are committing treason by threatening the Alpha?&#34;. Lorenzo asked. His voice was laced with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two of my kids are dead, one is badly injured. Is death worse than this?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He killed throughout the night. He would attack and when you think he is gone, he would come back,&#34; one shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes moved around the bodies lying on the ground. Then, my eyes caught a bracket, the same one I had given to Merlin. It laid on the hand of one of them.</p>
