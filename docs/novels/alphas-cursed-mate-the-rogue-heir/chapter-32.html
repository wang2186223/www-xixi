                <p>What the hell does she mean by &#34;that serves her right&#34;? They took her so that they could get me. Who could have done that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at my phone and click on the sender&#39;s contact. It&#39;s Lorenzo. Anger brewed within me as I clenched my fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I knew the cunning bastard would do anything to make me release Dean. And I thought Lia was in her room. How come I never noticed that she went out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse still is how she went out without telling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! I screamed. What was I going to do? If I bring Dean back because of Lia ,Sabrina would not be on my side again because she has already told me to see her as collateral damage. A means to an end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sabrina&#39;s voice brings me back from my thoughts &#34;Don&#39;t tell me you are thinking of saving her?&#39;&#39; she asks, glaring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squirm in the chair as I try to roll off the agitation on my shoulder. An effort I am sure I am failing miserably at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to save her&#34; I reply to her with a low yet strong voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I expect her to insult me for trying to save her. After all, she is a witch. She might just use her powers to trap me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind goes back to the picture they sent to me. Her hands tied, her eyes tied, her eyes filled with dry tears. I shook my head. I have to save her. I can&#39;t let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34; She asks with a sharp tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lorenzo,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you are still thinking of going to save her? He will make sure you remove the white oak from Dean&#39;s body before he releases her!&#34; She shouted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. You think I don&#39;t know about the risk involved but I can&#39;t just let them hurt her&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cocked her head to the side and folded her arms. Her eyes came back to me holding a dark note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what do you want to do?&#34; she asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand up and walk towards her as I explain&#34;I will try to save her myself. Only I can remove the oak. If I can outsmart them I can release her and come back&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corner of her lips lifted &#34;And how do you intend to do that?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled &#34;I am a hybrid, Sabrina. Or have you forgotten? I can take them on my own&#34; I reassured her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a step closer to me and I immediately knew that she was going to say something spiteful. Her middle finger poked my chest as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s what you do not know, you dump fool. If you go there they will leave Lia at gunpoint till you release her and if you don&#39;t they will kill her. I will be happy if it is executed because you seem to have a delicate part for her &#34;She took a step away from me and took her glass of juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever she said was true. If I didn&#39;t do it that way, they could kill her and I would not be able to do anything. I ran my hands through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was I going to do? I turned to Sabrina as my eyes softened. &#34;You have to help me,&#34; I pleaded with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She choked on the juice and then coughed then smacked her chest. &#34;What?&#34; she asked with raised eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am sure she must have insulted me or called me names in her mind. Worse still she would be regretting why she even tried to ally with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sabrina please&#34; I pleaded. I can&#39;t imagine pleading with someone over a girl I pushed out of my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything boils down to me. If I had not pushed her away she would be here or be on my bed and not in the hands of cruel Enzo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drank in her remaining juice ensuring to make a throat sound. She looked at me &#34;You are pathetic&#34; she said and dropped the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at me once more from my head to my toe and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved an exasperated breath as she left. Frustration brewed through me as I watched her leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To hell with her and her opinion. I am going to save her and there is nothing she can do about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another message notification popped up on my phone. Another video from Lorenzo. They placed Lia inside a bath filled with ice. Her skin had turned pale but that did not annoy me. What annoyed me was the fact that she was naked. He had stripped her naked. They poured another bucket of ice on her and she flinched a little bit. It was obvious that her body was getting cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my bottom lip till it drew blood. I had to save her but I did not know Sabrina&#39;s mind. She could decide to help Dean when I am gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head and rushed towards my room and picked up my car keys and my gun. I rushed down to meet a maid waiting for me at the end of the stairrail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bent her head &#34;Alpha you have a letter&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my eyebrows. Who on earth sent letters wrapped in envelopes when there was a phone to send anything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed it from her hand and opened it. Maybe it was from Lorenzo. Did the twat not get tired of sending photos and videos?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped as I opened the photo. It was Sabrina, her hands were about Dean&#39;s chest as if she was doing an incantation to release him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to the back to see the note she left &#34;The moment you step outside I will release him and I will turn against you&#34; she warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What.the.hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dashed upstairs,  towards the room where I kept Dean. I barged into the room. She stood there saying some incarnation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; I shouted at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged her lips as she dropped her hands.</p>
