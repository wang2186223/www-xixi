                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you have a scent?&#34; he asked, his voice filled with contempt and disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained silent, I knew I had never been lucky but why on earth would the moon goddess mate me to an Alpha?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha&#39;s brides are meant to be innocent, clean, and untouched. I was the opposite of the expectations for Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have been touched and I had a child for a man who I did not know. Although he seemed to be bearing a similar tattoo to the father of my child it did not change anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped as he grabbed me by my jaw &#34;Answer me!&#34; He shouts and I feel everyone around me flinching. His eyes sparkled with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have a wolf?&#34; I replied. He let go of my jaw with force. I glue my eyes to the ground to avoid everybody&#39;s eyes, particularly Lexie&#39;s own. I don&#39;t even know what her reaction will be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed, &#34;Can the moon goddess be more cruel?&#34; He asks no one in particular to walk around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dean! She is your mate!&#34; His father shouted from his seat, his voice sounding croaked because of his age and I heard he had been sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growled &#34;Oh please. I told you I did not need a mate and you forced me to find one only for me to discover that she decided to curse me with a woofless girl.&#34; he put his voice filled with venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He curses under his breath &#34;She doesn&#39;t even have a scent. Father. She has nothing. What&#39;s the use of mating me to someone close to a human? I am an Alpha, I can&#39;t and I will not accept her as my mate!&#34; He shouts pointing at me, his hands shaking with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do not question the moon goddess. She gave her to you to protect her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if I need to protect someone it should be someone who needs help not someone who is useless,&#34; he shouted, his voice cutting into my soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was going to reject me. It wasn&#39;t new, I knew no one would want me but deep down within me I wanted my mate to accept me. To give me that comfortable warmth that is needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned back to me, his eyes glowing yellow. I closed my eyes trying as much as I could to numb the pain that would come from the rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I, Alpha Dean, reject you as my-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cannot reject her and you will not reject her.&#39;&#39; A sharp feminine voice came from behind us. I turned around to look at her. She was in her fifties and wore a black gown with her hair painted black and white. She wore a long necklace that reached below her breast made with coral beads, beads that were similar to my bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Dean furrowed his eyebrow, his eyes reduced to a split as he looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has a wolf. It&#39;s just locked within,&#39;&#39; she added, maintaining Alpha Dean&#39;s glare with square shoulders that screamed confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a witch and she was confident about it. Witches were not allowed in this city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean Sabrina?&#34; Alpha Dean asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has a wolf and it has been locked. Accept her and we will be able to break the curse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at her for a while and then he had a smirk on his face before he burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this a ploy from my father to lure me into accepting her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe me she-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Believe you? You are a witch, your people hate wolves. You are alive today because my father spared you from them using you as a harvest and you think I should believe you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sabrina opened her mouth to explain but was cut short by Alpha Dean, &#34;Guard! Take her away!&#34; he shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two of his guards came to seize her. She put her hands in the air and walked up to me, leaning into my ears she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell Benedicta I said be careful,&#34; she said and took a step backward, petting my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember you are our own,&#34; she said and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Dean&#39;s voice drew me back from thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I, Alpha Dean, reject you as my mate,&#34; he said, finally uttering the words he had been waiting to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled sharply and looked at him. If I was to accept his rejection I should do it boldly after all he had not only rejected me but insulted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I, Lia Pierce, accept your rejection,&#34; I replied, my voice sharp with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting much time, I walked towards the door and left without waiting for Lexie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I was out of his mansion, I broke into tears. His rejection hurt me more than I expected, it was as if a part of me was being taken away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I boarded a cab and went straight to Benedict&#39;s house to meet my son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was unusually quiet. Tristian was meant to be around playing somewhere or maybe he was asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fastened my pace to his room and opened the door silently. He fell asleep on his bed. I heaved a sigh of relief. Thanks to the moon goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entered the room to caress his innocent face. Immediately the air at the back of my neck stood, I could feel someone&#39;s piercing gaze or should I say glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Having an illegitimate royalty is a big threat, you know. You could be killed&#34; A lethal voice spoke from the edge of the room where my back was facing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around and my eyes met with the burning red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34;I asked, trying to hide the fear that was seething up my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waved his hands in the air, &#34;Don&#39;t play dumb. I know this is Dean&#39;s child!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I, as his mother, is telling you that this is not Dean&#39;s child. His father is from Miami!&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saw the tattoo Ava, don&#39;t lie. You know within you that that is Dean&#39;s child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, did Dean send you?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I came on my own to offer you freedom. I would help you break your curse and in turn, you will go back to him or he will come looking for you and once you are inside you would destroy him for me,&#34; he replied with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34;I asked, my voice laced with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned wilder, &#34;That&#39;s for me to know and for you to dot.dot.dot,&#34; he said walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about it, the power of eventually becoming a Luna, which you will be given the fact that you are the mother to the heir.&#34; He said this time with a lethal voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And note, I don&#39;t take no for an answer,&#34; he said and left.</p>
