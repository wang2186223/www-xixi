                <p>Lia pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Lorenzo left they switched off the light and locked the door, darkness welcomed me in again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this the plan the moon goddess had? To make me a sacrificial lamb for my kind to live. Because I knew one thing for sure and that is Luca would not give up Dean for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked me out of his room,  he was just using me as a pawn just like Dean said. And the foolish me ended up having feelings for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gosh! I can believe how foolish I was to ever imagine that he was going to love me. For crying out loud I was not even his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something moves in the darkness drawing my attention. Fear gripped me as my feet became colder. What the hell was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did it come again? This time closer than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>! My heart sank into the depths of my chest. Don&#39;t tell me it was a snake. Then it came crawling towards my leg around my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help!&#34; I screamed. &#34;Somebody help me!&#34; I screamed again as fear gripped me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t die like this. I can&#39;t leave Merlin alone in this world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something sharp pressed through my arm &#34;!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It removed his teeth and slowly left my body. My eyelids become heavy. I tried to stay awake but I could not. I gradually closed my eyes and welcomed myself to a more comforting darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold liquid touched me. I opened my eyes slowly. My eyelids feel heavy. I shook my head as I tried to remember everything that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around me, my hands and legs were untied. I was in a bathtub not just in the bathtub I was naked. Like completely naked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who the hell put me in here? The door opened as Lorenzo and the two other guys entered. They carried a bucket filled with ice. What were they about to do to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo stood by the side of the tomb, his right hand tucked into his pocket. &#34;Your lover refused to pick up my calls or answer me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. It was not a new thing. Although a small part of me hoped that he would come for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you, he does not care about anyone&#34; I replied nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded with a smile &#34;Yes, I know. That is why I am going to make you suffer as my friend is suffering right now&#34; he replied, his voice laced with disdain. He poured the remaining drink on my breast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nipples tightened with fear. Shame breeds within me. The fact that he had stripped me naked before the three of them. Different thoughts ran through my mind. Was he going to rape me, or kill m?? Was it going to be a gang rape?.  For crying out loud, why should I suffer for the aims of others?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lorenzo, please. You can&#39;t just keep me here&#34; I pleaded, my voice shaking with fear</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded &#34;Of course I can and I will keep you here,&#34; he said and turned to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure you torture her till she passes out,&#34; he told them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes boss&#34; They nodded and he walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white-haired one carried a bucket of ice and poured it into the bathtub. The other one joined him. Soon the whole bathtub was filled with ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew what they were trying to do. They were trying to make me freeze till death like those in the Titanic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously I wished I was in there rather than being here. At least they were allowed to run. They sat before me watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them brought out a cigarette. Oh no! How the hell was I going to tell them that I was asthmatic? I am sure they knew, that was why they did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought out his lighter and turned it on. Soon the smoke filled the air. At first, I seized my breath, then I released it. Seizing my breath was another way to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled at me. My nostrils started blocking. I found it hard to breathe as I gasped for breath. The ice on my body made it worse. It seemed as if my blood had stopped flowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My skin turned pale. I took in a shaky breath as my chest hurt the more &#34;Please, can you take it outside&#34; I pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stooped for a while and raised his eyebrows. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am..am asthmatic&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at me and turned away. He took in a Long deep breath and exhaled. I watched as the plume of smoke came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gasping increased. I tried to stand up but he pointed a gun at me. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare take a step?&#34; He warned sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other tapped him, and they communicated through their eyes. He stood up and left me there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh of relief as he left although the smell was still there. The other one opened the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I said with gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened as he replied to me &#34;Don&#39;t be&#34; he said and sat down back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By this time my feet had become numb.    I could not feel my feet again. The cold came with pain and when I mean pain I mean a great deal of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My skin had already turned white. The other guard came inside but he was not with a cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat down facing me. His eyes were hollow and emotionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stand up&#34; he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally! I mustered. I tried to stand up but fell back into the bathtub. My body was stiff. I could not move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up and carried me from the tub and placed me on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay there naked and cold.</p>
