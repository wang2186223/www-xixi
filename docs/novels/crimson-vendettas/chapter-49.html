                <p>&#34;Oh, Alessandra.&#34; He chuckled darkly. &#34;I&#39;ve fucked many.&#34; Massimo pressed his thumb harder between my bud. &#34;But I fucked you hard until bloody.&#34; His fingers slid easily down my opening. &#34;No whore does that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers plunged deep inside, and I screamed in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was wrong. I couldn&#39;t take more of his brutal touch, his cruel fucking for a second round. Not so soon. My own body angrily yelled for the pain to stop. The burning that wouldn&#39;t subside as his fingers showed no mercy. The torment caused by his fist connecting to my tender entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit back the tears and the following screams, not once backing out of what I&#39;d walked into. Because when my eyes met his demented browns, satisfied by my struggle to not push him away from his brutality, I knew nothing I could do would make him take or give gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was either this or nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to take the pain to get his passion. Take his savage demon to get near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Massimo!&#34; I cried out, dropping my head to his chest. Ready to give up for once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so fucking close to losing to his vicious touch that defeat hurt deeper than his sadism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I felt his smile against me, the stretch of his jaw pulling apart and the slight bounce in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pain made him smile!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I refused to lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head lifted, and my lips brushed against his skin, tongue running up his neck, licking his inked veins and leftover creeping water. Massimo&#39;s head fell further. His neck stretched, welcoming my gentle assault, and his fingers faltered inside me. Sluggish movements that brought back a pang of pleasure after I found the skin below his ear. I took a chance and tiptoed up to him as his body straightened, our flesh flushed against another seeking warmth. My nipples rubbed his chest as my tongue and lips played with his skin. The burn eased, and the pain danced with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved my hips above his hand and hummed in delirium.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did it again, and my teeth clamped lightly on his shoulder. &#34;Ahh&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t so lucky for a third time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo removed his hand and gripped my hips tightly, pushing me back and away from his skin. The brittle cold tile shook a splintering wave down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t.&#34; His labored whisper was loud against my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo backed away, but his hands remained firm as his fingertips dug into my flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So choose wisely, as I&#39;m trying to give you the chance to rest tonight, because tomorrow I will fuck you. You are just deciding how sore you wish to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I peered up at his hungry eyes. His chest vibrated with the control it&#39;d taken him to say those words, and when I glanced down at his heavy dick, I imagined the agony of containing his release. The eagerness to set free the build up as I, too, felt the power of the game I&#39;d created.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo&#39;s hands fisted on my skin, drawing out my answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were slit with measure. He wanted a direct answer, so I gave it. I held his dick in my palm, and Massimo&#39;s eyes, face, and body lost their composure by my touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo cut the water off and snatched me up so fast that I wrapped my body tightly to his to prevent being in the way of his wild wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my legs around his middle and my arms holding onto his neck, I turned to view our path out of the bathroom but came up short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know the fucking way.&#34; His hand shot out, clasping my jaw and unwinding his mad lips on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between erratic breaths of need, I kissed him back until I was robbed of his lips and cold air hit my skin by the loss of his. In a quick reaction, my arms spread out aimlessly as my body fled in the air from his toss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ass hit the bed first, and I gripped the covers to watch him move like the predator he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was no prey, and as he crawled over my body and onto the bed, I fought for what I wanted, even if I knew it wasn&#39;t possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo&#39;s frame hovered above me, and when his dick pressed down on my abdomen, the thirst for control swaddled me whole. I pushed my leg down and pushed myself up to turn our bodies. A challenging move to accomplish because of his weight, but surprise was my ally, and momentum was a favor from above. My damp hair draped down my breasts as I looked down at Massimo&#39;s vigorous glare. The room had grown quiet from our stillness, but chaos threatened nearby as his gaze took in my position above his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught by his eyes, hesitation stirred, and I didn&#39;t dare move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, and in a blur, Massimo shackled my neck with his hand. He rolled my body off his until his weight trapped me on the bed. I bucked, but underneath him, I barely stirred. I did it again and again, and each time, I lost to his possessive hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hair twisted in all directions from my jerks, and breathing became a struggle. Panic rose from the constricting feeling of captivity and helplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo never eased with each thrash. Instead, his cruelty lingered, drawing out the fight and enjoying its pull. I waited for the fright to come while his hand gripped my neck and the other held onto my wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But fear didn&#39;t show because I was sick. I had to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped fighting, stopped thrashing, and peered through the strands of hair over my face, searching for his deep bourbon gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you done fighting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cruel smile formed on his full lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why stop?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realized I enjoyed how easily you overpowered me. How I was bare and vulnerable beneath you with no escape and craved it. Because now I know I want to be under your mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fucking sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you done?&#34; I asked instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, it was he who shook his head no, with a hunting smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo positioned his legs between mine until they were spread open for him. His eyes calculated me as he slowly removed most of his weight from me. When he felt it was safe, Massimo freed my wrist from his grip. Then his lips crashed onto mine, and my fiery body clung on for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His teeth bit, pulled, and stung my lips raw while his hands mirrored his desire for my body. When he pulled away, I pushed back for more, wanting his lips back and his touch claiming my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo only allowed it briefly because he was the one who could claim, not the one to be claimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping my leg, he spun our bodies until we rolled. His strength shuffled me with ease, and I gasped, staring down at him in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo may have been below me, but I had no power as he quickly grabbed my ass, lifting it up and jerking it near his face. He pulled my bottom down, and I lost my balance when my pussy met his eager mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Massimo!&#34; I gasped, arms out and fingertips clutching onto the headrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so sensitive, and his tongue had no pity for its assault. Untamed, Massimo devoured me as if he hadn&#39;t had enough the first time. There was no room for pain, only pleasure, as he dictated the speed of my hips by his hands and the force of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My attempts to keep up with the pace became a punishment that I could not endure. With my eyes closed and my head back, I cried out, shaking from the pressure I couldn&#39;t control. I couldn&#39;t take it anymore. It was too much, and yet he seemed to have just started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Massimo, please,&#34; I begged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My plea was answered with a muffled chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Massimo, I can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d tried again believing my words, attempting to move away. Instead, he managed to gain a stronger grip and long laps with his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for his head and hair and pulled back. Annoyed eyes shot up at mine. Massimo ran tongue over his wet and parted lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That will cost you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t.&#34; I shook my head between my pants and ran my nails slowly over his scalp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed his eyes briefly, enjoying the feeling. I did it again, but his eyes shot open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo slipped from my hands, and his tongue connected to my bud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; I gripped his hair and pulled his head back again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger rushed through his eyes in warning, and then all of a sudden, the air vanished. I gasped, but my windpipe burned. I clutched onto his gripping hold on my neck as his other hand prevented my hips from moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are too sore to come with me inside you. But you can and will over my face so I can fuck and load you with my cum.&#34; Massimo&#39;s lip curled. &#34;Do you understand, Alessandra?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My god, what has he done to me? I was panting over the loss of air he&#39;d created. I could practically feel my own wetness slithering between my legs as my nipples tightened by just his words. His promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Use your words, Alessandra.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, now you sit on my face and let me taste you until there&#39;s nothing left,&#34; he huskily ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved too slow to his demand, and he applied pressure to my neck. My back straightened, and my hips bucked straight into his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo took over quickly, and pleasure returned instantly. With his strong hand keeping me from breathing freely and the other using my own body against me, it all became too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moaned loudly and panted with each kiss, lick, and slurp until no sound could escape. Only heaving breaths managed to escape my lips as the tighter his choking grip grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was near losing consciousness. High from the loss of air, its pain, and the torturous pleasure his mouth gave, but it all combined into a powerful bliss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body shook with heavy spasms, letting go over his face. When his hand loosened, my head fell forward only to be recaptured by it. Massimo entangled his fingers in my hair, holding and pulling it back as he licked me through my quivers until nothing was left as he&#39;d promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still so high from my release that when my hips were removed from his face, I lowered my hands to his hair and tugged-hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh!&#34; I cried out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo pushed his dick deeply into my sensitive and sore pussy. The burning and pain wasn&#39;t compared to how it felt the first time he&#39;d taken me. And as I tried to pull, push and thrash for a better angle, all my effort had managed was to take him deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With wide eyes, I watched him enjoy my pain through the small smile that mocked along the corner of the lips that had once brought me pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo didn&#39;t give me a minute or two to adjust to his length. He gave me seconds. His hands found my hips, and he used my body for his own purposes, thrusting deep and hard inside me, bouncing my hips up and down with force. Fucking me wildly while hitting the spot that caused my breathing to be erratic, wild, even if it felt like he was splitting me by the raging pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Massimo,&#34; I pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You. Never. Listen,&#34; Massimo&#39;s dark voice said between thrusts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t.</p>
