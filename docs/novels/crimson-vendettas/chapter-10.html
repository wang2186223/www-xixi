                <p>Opening my left fist, I fought its trembling, and I hated every second of it. It showed weakness, but I couldn&#39;t stop it. My body acted on its own, failing to heed my commands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo stood unbothered as he grasped my cold hand, gliding the gold band securely onto my finger. I dared to look up. His eyes swarmed in sadistic triumph as he memorized my ringed hand. His.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should change into warm clothes before we leave.&#34; His offer caught me off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dress in this weather wasn&#39;t my first choice, but it was the easiest to conceal and retrieve my push dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your body&#39;s temperature says otherwise.&#34; Massimo squeezed my fingers. The tell of my lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled my hand away. &#34;Do you care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled. It was the first time I&#39;d seen it, and while it reached his eyes, I didn&#39;t trust it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I care to leave the city before the storm arrives.&#34; He waved his hands. &#34;So, if you need to get comfortable and warm, do so now. I won&#39;t be stuck in New York for longer than I need to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the longest Massimo had ever spoken to me, but it was clear he didn&#39;t care as he ignored my statement. There was no reason to say I, too, shared his hatred for New York. How I&#39;ve been waiting for the last night I would sleep under my father&#39;s roof. A house that haunted me to the point of fleeing thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He. Wouldn&#39;t. Care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll grab my coat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, and his hand startled me as it applied pressure to my arm. Massimo then twisted his hand, bringing me back to face him once more. I had promised I wouldn&#39;t cower under his stare, but his eyes sought violence. With his hand tightening and causing pain, my heart could almost weep at the life I would have as his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t expecting trust, respect, or love out of our marriage. I was no fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I had wished for a life without physical abuse. A life I never wanted to return to. Because I would always fight back, and it would only hurt more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo&#39;s free hand tipped my chin. Defiant, I searched for his eyes, but they weren&#39;t on mine. They were focused on the bruise my father had gifted me by my hairline. His gaze then scrutinized every inch of my face. My arm muscles ached, and I swung my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held both my face and my body tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go.&#34; I seethed, but my next words caught his attention. &#34;You are hurting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dropped his hands automatically, without an apology, as if he had lost his cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one word, he ordered an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you care?&#34; I asked again, but this time my tone had grown bitter. I could easily have said my father, but after the way he had hurt me himself, he had no right to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be bold, Alessandra. I torture answers with a smile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An icy chill settled over me. A whip of warning to stay quiet. A lash I didn&#39;t listen to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You would torture your future wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; His detached voice answered. My breath hitched as my mouth parted, and I wanted to scream out the trapping shackle on my finger. Massimo closed any space left between us. His hand trailed to my chin. &#34;I will have you begging.&#34; His thumb dragged my lip while his eyes trailed with the swipe of his thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick, labored breaths filled my lungs as I reeled in his words. With his hands on me, it was a difficult task to accomplish. I tore away his heavy fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, answer me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exasperated, I blurted, &#34;Franco Zanetti.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo didn&#39;t seem shocked to hear my father&#39;s name, but he turned away from my gaze. When I found his eyes again, they were empty and out of my reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not used to being gentle,&#34; he said quietly. &#34;But if I leave a mark on your arm, it will be the last.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you leave a mark, I&#39;ll be sure to leave you one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My emotions won over the years of practicing deception, but I wasn&#39;t mentally capable of fretting over my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humor shimmered through his eyes so quickly that it could have been an illusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the whispers of Massimo Lombardi. The youngest mob boss to have ever taken over a syndicate. The ruthless and cold killer. How quiet and yet lethal his mind worked to his gain. Most importantly, how he was a man of few words. That when he spoke, each word was deliberately thought-out and purposefully said. Perhaps I should have paid them more attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay cold then.&#34; I&#39;d forgotten where this conversation had started. &#34;After you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tired of mind games, I walked. While his steps were silent, his presence was loud behind me. Massimo&#39;s strong hand shot out in front of my body before I had the chance to open the door. Inked fingers gripped the copper doorknob, and I saw my brothers waiting as he pulled the door open. Both Aldo and Dante were far enough for privacy but close enough to hear a cry for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of Massimo&#39;s hand connected with my lower back as he stood beside me. A jolt of warmth and possessiveness followed his hand gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t the kind that would make your toes curl up from feeling wanted. It was the kind of possession that slowly suffocated. As he showed it in front of my blood, I knew that for men like Massimo, the word possessive was nowhere near the depth described in textbooks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dante&#39;s lips twisted, and for once, he kept his volatile actions restrained. When Massimo&#39;s hand pressed forward, I took a step with him in tow. Dante held on to a ledge so thin, with features flaring in displeasure. Meanwhile, Aldo&#39;s eyes watched me carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost laughed. A belly and ear-splitting laugh at the absurdity of the play before me.</p>
