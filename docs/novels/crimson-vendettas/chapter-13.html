                <p>Her eyes flamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Test me, the demon begged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra didn&#39;t utter another word, and for the first time, she looked out the window. The weather had changed so quickly in the sky as brightness filtered through, promising Miami&#39;s heat soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t offer the idea of her changing out of her form-fitting winter dress. The black color would attract the sun, and the long sleeves would soon stick over her arms once we landed. This time, I let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let Miami give her the warm welcome her eyes showed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Home. That was what the streets of Miami were to me. My brothers, the reason I bathed in blood and corruption. The Lombardi Crime, my claim to this city and empire I&#39;d rebuilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leonardo had given me the keys to the syndicate long before he&#39;d stepped down. As his health deteriorated, he became more of a background to business encounters. Entrusting me to step up to my birthright. He still operated as the boss in front of the famiglia. We couldn&#39;t look weak, even to our men. When it became evident the boss of Miami was terminally ill, moves had to be made. Shifts to be waived until the Ferretti name was taken and replaced by mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d built something unorthodox within our Outfit. A syndicate where trust and honor ran thicker than blood and made up by now four men who&#39;d once left Miami&#39;s Home for Boys. Each one is a crucial key to running Miami as I saw fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the last step off the plane and waited for Alessandra&#39;s descent. Her eyes squinted, looking ahead, and she let out a brash exhale against the humidity and high temperatures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Welcome home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a concealed smirk, I said, &#34;After you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such a gentleman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fucking mouth. Her will excited me and yet filled me with ire. With her, patience was not one of my strengths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift movement, I faced her with my hand wrapped around the back of her hairline. Shock glistened from her green gems as she tried to draw away. My face inched closer in wild darkness. There was no escape. My hand covered most of her neck as her hair entwined with my fingers. A small, delicious taste I wanted to explore further, but first, she needed a tug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen carefully. I will not repeat myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shimmer of fear flew past her features. Good. This game she wanted to play risked high stakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to make her understand, and this was the only way I could do it without causing her physical pain, even while my demon begged for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Miami, Alessandra. My city. Therefore, soon yours.&#34; Her eyes swayed, and I applied pressure to keep them on me. &#34;Inside the doors of my home and my bed, be my guest. Feed my twisted mind. But I won&#39;t allow your disrespect in public.&#34; Her hand gripped my forearm tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we clear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was, the igniting fire in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t treat me like a child.&#34; Her head tilted defiantly. &#34;Iwas born into this world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her weak jab didn&#39;t faze me. She didn&#39;t know who I was, or my past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then act like it.&#34; I released my grip and rolled my shoulders back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra&#39;s head tilted, her lips curled, and she gritted her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was aware we were too far to be heard. Even on the plane, my voice never reached your man.&#34; She spoke quickly, but now, it was she who wanted to make things clear. &#34;I won&#39;t cower to you, Massimo.&#34; It was the second time she&#39;d spoken my name. It fell from her lips just as alluringly as it had in front of her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know the rules of this world of ours and what it means to become your wife. Which is why I never spoke out loud. Whispers can become threats. If a boss&#39;s mere wife can disrespect him, what will keep others from doing so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look surprised. I&#39;m a woman, not an imbecile. After all, I am here because others could not have done what I could.&#34; I pushed her to continue. &#34;A treaty between families.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your brother did that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s me who is marrying you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smirk, I said, &#34;Good, then we are clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra walked past me, and I watched her go straight to the waiting car. Her hand gently touched her neck, rubbing the back of her neck gently. A gesture that could have been taken due to the discomfort I&#39;d caused, and I couldn&#39;t remove my eyes away from her. The confidence she displayed even with her back facing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was right. Alessandra posed a threat. She knew more than I had given her credit for. That was my mistake, underestimating her. But she&#39;d overshared, and glimpses of this deceitful creature were revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gesture was nothing more than a clever line to lure me into her cunning agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I followed behind her, I thought of our brief conversations, and the brief glimpse of fear she&#39;d shown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had been real, and what had been a game?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ALESSANDRA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was losing control. A feeling that left me desperate and reckless. Placing blame on the drastic changes in my life would have been easier than the thought that he was the reason for my outbursts, but I knew the truth. It was him.</p>
