                <p>This jewelry store in particular had over-the-top security, and I didn&#39;t think it was due solely to its large equity figure. Lo Splendore wasn&#39;t a small business run by an Italian in the corner of a city. It was a store that viewed the crystal-blue beach. It dripped with brilliant elegance in dim lighting and shining chandeliers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nate and I waited to be let in as two of Massimo&#39;s men stood outside. Vadim and Davina decided to stay behind, and I was thankful. As much as I enjoyed their banter, I wanted a moment alone. Even if that meant with Nate close by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nate looked at his watch again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d done it once in the wedding boutique. Three times in the car, and it seemed he wasn&#39;t done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something I should be aware of, Nate?&#34; I asked, staring straight ahead at the man who was nearing in an all-black suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have to be somewhere else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why are you continuously looking at the time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;You sound like him, you know.&#34; My eyes slid to him, and he finally answered in a loud exhale. &#34;I have alerts set for when we are out in the open. I keep looking at my watch because I want to make sure nothing has changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man offered his hand and said kindly, &#34;Mrs. Lombardi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook it and returned my hand to my small clutch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zanetti,&#34; I corrected him. &#34;Soon to be Lombardi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course!&#34; His chin dipped. &#34;Congratulations on such a joyful time for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My smile tightened, but to him it only showed cheer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right this way, I have the room set up for you.&#34; He motioned for us to follow him and added, &#34;Mr. Lombardi prefers privacy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nate stepped closer to my side as I followed the man at a distance, and he murmured, &#34;Why do you do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what, exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked past the empty sales floor. By the looks of it, Nate&#39;s call wasn&#39;t just to expect us, but to cater solely to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Correct him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I am a Zanetti, and I don&#39;t bear his nameyet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was simple. I was unwed, and that title came only after we both said I do. Until then, I was just another sick Zanetti.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nate&#39;s hand gently touched my upper back, and he uttered, &#34;I walk in first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone changed at the sight of the newly opened door, and his easy smile and demeanor shifted to cold and stone-like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nate&#39;s craft wasn&#39;t just reading people, it was transforming into another persona in seconds. A smart and ruthless skill when played by him. He was the chameDanten of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited a few seconds by the seamless door casing. I was alert with one hand near the edge of my skirt while paying attention to Nate and my surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you coming?&#34; he quipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes narrowed, and he shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suppressed my chuckle and walked into the room. The man who had provided his name as Joseph explained the sections of rings he&#39;d placed on a large glass casing. And while he spoke with no end, I stopped listening after he&#39;d said they were all Massimo&#39;s ring size. I studied the tall ceiling and their structural beams that could sustain its shape and heavy mounted stones. I trailed the lines and angles, playing them in my head until I ran out of walls and molds to look at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And on this-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Joseph, for your time,&#34; I cut him off. &#34;I&#39;ll take it from here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled and left with a curt nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What took you so long?&#34; Nate chimed as the door closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked closer to the large collection of wedding bands. &#34;Are you telling me you are not interested in the grade, materials, and metal of each one of these?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got jokes, huh?&#34; He glanced over at the casing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guess I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The selection was too broad, and as I stared at the case filled with diamonds, I avoided choosing one of them. Massimo&#39;s taste was too refined and strict to wear something flashy against his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The guy mentioned how Massimo preferred privacy, as if he spent many hours here. He must come often.&#34; I leaned my hip over the glass and faced Nate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled knowingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you must know, Alessandra. No, he doesn&#39;t. I know my brother. If he wanted something, it would be specific, and only a few items would be displayed similar to his request. My bet is, he comes in, takes a look, and walks out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if you are trying to find out what kind of thing she buys here.&#34; His brow lifted, and I waited. &#34;It would be a new watch.&#34; He paused and smiled crookedly. &#34;Cufflinks.&#34; His palms waved. &#34;Or custom-made brass knuckles. Nothing delicate, nothing feminine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smile on my lips, I returned to the rings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes roamed row by row, absorbing all the colors, from gold, silver, black, to gray. The forms and edges of each were unique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This would be more challenging than finding a dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are so many options, it&#39;s-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Diamonds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good choice,&#34; he replied and fired questions. &#34;Black or gray?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Silver?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about it for a second, but while our marriage was far from traditional, I wanted his band to match the ring he&#39;d given me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mother&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, that narrows it down some.&#34; Nate quickly rearranged the bands until only one casing remained. &#34;Now, the first four that you are drawn to.&#34; His hands ushered me forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now eliminate two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took each band and returned two to its padding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pick one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I traced each edge and detail, feeling its grooves and twists. Both bands were similar, and yet unique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I loved them both, and as I stared at them, I couldn&#39;t decide which would bear his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think he will wear it?&#34; I wondered, lost in gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you ever thought of marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; My head turned to face him, but his eyes were down on the various rings. &#34;But it&#39;s not something I see happening. Not with what I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nate shared, and a part of me thanked him for doing so because he didn&#39;t have too. As his thoughts pried him away into memories, I could see the sorrow of his admission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nate had someone special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not with what you do?&#34; I echoed his words. &#34;Massimo is getting married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As a boss, he has to, Alessandra. And you&#39;ve always been in harm&#39;s way by being born into this life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I knew this, his words stung. Because if it hadn&#39;t been me, another woman would be walking down the aisle for the same reason I was supposed to, duty. I was just offered before he sought out his future queen. In fact, we were never meant to meet. Never meant to coexist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I repeated his words in my head, and uttered, &#34;She&#39;s not affiliated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t have to reply, his tensed body answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish it was that simple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two knocks erupted throughout the room, and I was left with burning questions. Joseph stepped inside and waited near the opened door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you found anything that interests you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have,&#34; I replied, and drew my shoulders back as he walked closer. &#34;Which one of these is one of a kind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved closer, looking at them, and he quickly replied, &#34;The one on your left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great.&#34; I smiled at the gold band. &#34;This is it. I&#39;ll wait for the payment information so I can clear the wire transaction, and please add the sole right to its design.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph blinked, taken aback by my request but quickly regained his composure. &#34;There&#39;s no need, Miss. Zanetti. We already have an account on file.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the man, finally looking directly at him and his shiny slicked-back hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And per my request, you can disregard that account for this purchase. I will take care of it, and please don&#39;t forget to hand me the paperwork while you retrieve the information I asked for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Adam&#39;s apple bobbed, and without another word he did as told.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, I bet you drive him mad,&#34; Nate whispered nearby with glee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MASSIMO</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Texas</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neutral territory. That was what I requested when I had called out a council meeting and how I found myself on a private flight to Houston. But this city was far from corrupt. Texas was one of the main streams that traveled all across the States and into our cities. A gateway that we all benefited from, with resources and people we all used throughout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is as neutral as it gets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our rules were simple. Every boss must travel with only one man by their side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Council meetings were secretive for the safety of each syndicate. The exact location and time was only known to the bosses to rule out any leaks or threats. They were rare and requested when an issue needed to be discussed in person. An issue that could potentially harm La Cosa Nostra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to the rules already being broken, I didn&#39;t trust Giuliani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t trust this meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this was one way I could get him out of California to see the bastard. Even if it was surrounded by family members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not take him out now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to act as if you didn&#39;t speak, Elio.&#34; I glanced at my watch, fifteen minutes until landing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I faced him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elio sat on the opposite side of the cabin, but his seat faced the back of the jet. He repeatedly tugged the knot in his tie, uncomfortable to wear a full suit. While his clothing had changed since becoming my underboss, he still preferred his dark jeans and black tee on messy days. The others, he spent it in dress pants and a black tee. Never a tie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know the answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And yet, I&#39;m asking you.&#34; His light-brown eyes challenged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath. &#34;If he dies, or any of us don&#39;t return to our cities, the famiglia will crumble by mistrust.&#34; My eyes fell to my last drink for the day. &#34;If he dies,&#34; I repeated, &#34;they&#39;ll know it was me. Unless he steps in Miami, in the eyes of the council, he is not a direct threat to me. I need to assure you that our rules are still in place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leandro is in Miami,&#34; he spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have proof, Elio? A fucking picture, or someone alive that can confirm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We knew it, which meant the whispers would have eventually made it to the other bosses. But that was all they were. Whispers, rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why are we even here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For my next move. To look Giuliani in the eyes, knowing he was oblivious to what I had planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To cause chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra. Alessandra. Alessandra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every thought and every step I made across the street was with her in my mind. The promise of keeping her safe was my top priority. I wouldn&#39;t have believed it if it wasn&#39;t for the weight that dragged inside of my chest, the constricting pressure to eliminate all threats to what was mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miami.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ALESSANDRA.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rana sent me a text,&#34; Elio whispered as we neared the side entrance of Calabria&#39;s. &#34;Looks like they finally made it. Were you aware of Alessandra needing to run an errand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped under the shade of the overhang of the roof and turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, I wasn&#39;t aware, but what bothered me was Nate and Vadim not mentioning it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elio faced the wooded line behind the establishment, eyes scanning the few acres of the secluded land in which the winery stood. A few couples walked the manicured and shaded grounds, enjoying the gentle breeze against the Texas heat.</p>
