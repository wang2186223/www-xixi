                <p>&#34;And he&#39;s part of it.&#34; He nudged toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer, and his head bobbed, putting the blurry pieces together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before you answer, I must tell you, if you choose this path, it means you&#39;ll be with those who had a part of what happened to your parents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could give two shits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been wrong. These two years had done more than physical changes. They&#39;d buried the boy I&#39;d left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are my family now. And you are wrong. I owe you my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, and after a curt dip of my chin, I walked up to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elio didn&#39;t follow until I said, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll return for them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t finish my sentence. I couldn&#39;t, and I wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Elio stepped away, and as I walked away, he briefed me quickly. &#34;Security will be increased, and Nate will have eyes on you both at all times. And you will have two tails as you drive. I will be inside the building, and six are infiltrating the catering crew. The others will be around the premises on standby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There he was. With a dark smile, I twisted the knob. &#34;Now don&#39;t go making my dick soft.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck off, Massimo. Don&#39;t question me either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never did, fratello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I drove, all I desired was to find her emeralds, vibrant with life. Instead, I sat inside my car for far too long, moving pieces, strategizing, and following each trail and response. All flawed with blurry outcomes. One thing they all had in common was how clear they became once Aldo would take his father&#39;s seat. I didn&#39;t trust Franco&#39;s support at a council meeting. It was obvious he didn&#39;t care what could happen to Alessandra. However, I needed to find out the extent of their broken ties. I needed to request a council meeting before the wedding. With such a short timeline, and the publicity, I had to move quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ALESSANDRA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d lost control of my mind and goals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruled by greed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wanting too much. Wanting what I thought I deserved. As if I knew the things I desperately craved. Respect, appreciation, want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was I kidding? Massimo was immune to them all. Immune to my games and deceit. They had earned me nothing but a fickle heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I stood over my knife casing, waiting for him, dressed as the principessa I was, waiting for a man, I knew nothing had changed. The never-ending circle that continuously repeated in my life was only different by yet another timeframe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only this time, I was a bride-to-be. A broken but spiteful-hearted woman whose demands have fallen into the hands of a beatless heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew this because today I&#39;d awoken to an empty bed. Like another fuck. Sore and bruised like a soldier who&#39;d complied with every order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as I knew this, felt this, I still leaned forward and listened closely to the sound of his car tires nearing. I was eager for a night away from this house and with him by my side. But once the car was parked, the sound of his exit or the door closing was non-existent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes passed with no Massimo in sight, just a running engine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed out the window, but the tint was too dark to see through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something wasn&#39;t right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling had loomed over the house for hours. Nate would usually wander throughout the house spontaneously, but today his demeanor had changed-alert and glued to his phone. And his easy smile had concealed information. He&#39;d checked on me more than usual, and I misunderstood it as worry from yesterday&#39;s turn of events. But at this moment, it made sense, and I should have listened to my instincts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, I had been left in the dark, and I was sick of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine turned off, and Massimo stepped out. I couldn&#39;t see him clearly, and I hated not confirming my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited and waited, but he never stepped into his study. Well, I was tired of waiting, so I walked toward the door and paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes caught the two moves made since I&#39;d last seen the unfinished chess game. And a crawling chill rolled over my body. I shook my head and left it behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was really growing mad inside this house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The closer I got to the door, the clearer the steps grew from the other side. I held the doorknob when the footfalls stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One. Two. Three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing. They just stood quietly on the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled the door open, revealing dark eyes and an even darker aura. It pulled and swirled over me, bathing me in sin&#39;s addictive promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you hesitate?&#34; I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t hesitate.&#34; He stared deeply into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I didn&#39;t back down from our standoff, his immoral eyes fell over my cherry-stained lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo shook his head, dropping his gaze down on my body. As if his attention on me was needed. His eyes traveled along my neck and over the skin my dark-green dress forgot to cover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mood quickly changed to need while his eyes followed my silhouette, tracing each curve and mold on my body and lingering over the long slit of my dress skirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A possessive demon lured behind his eyes when they returned to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You lookgood,&#34; he said carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo&#39;s hand lifted from his side, placing it on my bare back. A deep breath released from between his teeth at the feel of my skin. And with curled fingers and a dominating hold, he pulled me into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt all of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hold never eased, it only tightened, causing discomfort from the bruise near my ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grazie.&#34; I breathed. &#34;You look&#34; I thought of the right word, but like him, I didn&#39;t dare. I snickered and ran the tip of my tongue over my bottom lip. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo looked far from okay in a tuxedo, surrounded by vice and luring arrogance. Immoral, yet seductive. Sinful, but tempting. Brutal power and looks that matched his cold heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How sore are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled with composure, and he did too as his fingers pressed into my flesh. In pain, I parted my mouth and lowered my gaze. The truth was, every step I took ached, every breath I exhaled burned. And assuring my dress concealed my ill marks was difficult to accomplish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll give you a few more hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at him. He&#39;d meant for sex. Either way, I wasn&#39;t explaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted my hands to his chest and caught his chest and caught his cautious stare. Raising a brow, I took his untied bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See,&#34; my eyes spoke as I slid my fingers across the smooth fabric and tied the bowtie in knots and loops until I created the perfect bow under his white collar and tanned inked neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced back at his empty browns. They&#39;d never left. Not once had they stirred away from me. Not away from my face, body, or eyes. Always on me. And while they gave nothing, they told me enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The madness inside. The chaos they would soon release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Massimo,&#34; I urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you are ready, we should get moving, we are already running late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine. Let&#39;s keep playing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of agreeing with his request, I removed my gaze from him and walked deeper into the room, showcasing the low back dip in my dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to leave a note for Thalia to hand over to Nate.&#34; Innocently, I picked up a pen from his desk and looked for a clean notepad. &#34;To remind him to pick up the boys from-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandra, wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His warning was too late. I had the drawer open, and I saw a portion of myself captured on paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A picture of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a coffee shop. Far from here, and in a time where there was no arrangement of us. Unaware, and relaxed in a life I now mourn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My shoulders sank, and my fingers trapped the image unconsciously, clutching it tightly. I faced him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurt and confusion veiled over me in a rash beat, and just as quickly, accusation followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You lied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have time for this,&#34; he said indifferently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sa- You said.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I didn&#39;t lie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo closed the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart hammered, shattering the peace I believed I had across the sea. I&#39;d been so ignorant, thinking I had everything under control. How naive of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed down at the picture again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If not you, who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father didn&#39;t care enough for a picture, and if he had, all he had to do was speak to Nonno. And if I ruled Massimo out, there was just one man left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One that would be interested enough to look into my past. One that would have me followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Giuliani,&#34; I whispered in hatred. Disgusted. &#34;Why do you have it?&#34; I questioned. &#34;I swear to you, Massimo. I will find out for myself, and you will not appreciate how I will acquire information if you don&#39;t speak!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you threatening to look for trouble, Alessandra?&#34; he mocked. &#34;You are too smart for a foolish damsel.&#34; Massimo leaned against the door, locking his ankles together. &#34;You are past the immature and compulsive feelings that would lead you into real danger.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;Don&#39;t peg me for a fool. You&#39;re a ruthless and deceitful little creature that has mastered the art of survival.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Creasing the picture back into its folded mold, I tossed it onto the desk and faced him. Massimo stood taller the closer I got to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right. I&#39;m too fucking smart.&#34; I shrugged and continued, &#34;I know I&#39;m the leverage that holds not just my famiglia, but now yours too from drowning. The ones you&#39;ve actually fought to keep alive by trading another life without remorse for it.&#34; His gaze narrowed. &#34;So tell me, Massimo. How is keeping me unaware of the bloodbath of our union a benefit for you?&#34; My fingernails scraped his covered torso and swept up his shoulder. &#34;A stray bullet could take away your leverage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo&#39;s hand snapped, capturing my neck and paralyzing me in his strong and desperate grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t be a stray bullet, Alessandra.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips lowered, and the threat kissed my ear. &#34;You are the target.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Death hummed with a smile as she set her sights on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowledge was ice cold, paralyzing my fingers on his arms. Rigid muscles stiff from comprehension. And my heart trembled with confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Women in La Cosa Nostra weren&#39;t killed by their own. Tragedies happened due to accidents, stray bullets, and outsiders. Women and children weren&#39;t meant to be targets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed so hard that Massimo pried me away, wary of my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I guess since the rules don&#39;t apply to me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is not funny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it is not. All you had to do was treat me as an equal, so at least I had a chance.&#34; A thought came to mind. &#34;Am I in danger tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you weren&#39;t intending to tell me, were you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked out, numb. His honesty, too much for me to fight. I could&#39;ve lashed out, asked for more details, but the answer would have been the same. So, I headed straight out the front door, leaving him behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A full moon glared and radiated its light in the grim night. But its shine never touched me. It only bounced against the two running and blacked out SUVs behind Massimo&#39;s black Maserati. I breathed in deeply, filling my lungs with the peace offered by the salty air, and opened the car door. Inside the car, alone and masked by darkness, I screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I screamed with impotence at the men-ruled world around me.</p>
