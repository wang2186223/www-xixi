                <p>&#34;Do you think I missed your hand slipping behind you? I can only imagine what it carries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take your hands off me.&#34; Her sneer shook with the loss of air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra&#39;s eyes shimmered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand answered, slithering out in the open with fingers twirling her push dagger into position. Sweat glistened from her skin, and her small gasps held her tensed posture upright, pushing her thin sportswear against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room&#39;s low temperature caused the shiver that erupted from her dampened clothes, and the peaks of her chest tightened as her nipples hardened, rubbing against my dress shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra&#39;s grip was weak, her body was spent, and her eyes pleaded. A request I ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering my face, our breath mingled, and my lips flirted with the soft touch of hers. I needed to walk away. I&#39;d just been under gunfire. A bloody massacre in broad daylight, and my mind still held the adrenaline and souls I&#39;d taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, I faced Alessandra with no control. It was dangerous, the way wrath cracked in twisted desire because of her threat. It was sick, depraved, and yet I craved it. Needed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Needed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My demon raged to take and clip her spirit. But it was her spirit, her useless threats, and her belief in being equals that made my dick hard and drove me to desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I showed her how much her defiance affected me by pushing my painful bulge to her bare midsection. Alessandra&#39;s chin boldly lifted, and her bravado only unraveled my desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Releasing her throat to take her nape and jaw firmly, I pressed my scruff against her face, scraping it across her velvet skin to meet her ear. Heavily, she heaved large gulps of air, filling her chest with convulsing pants. The motion vibrated through me, and I groaned at its delicious feeling. I lifted the weight of my right hand, pressing my gun flat over her hair, holding them both in place while her thick locks entwined, leaving the gorgeous and morbid sight engraved into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra exhaled a faint whine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck, there was no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You drive me mad, Alessandra.&#34; My lips murmured against her ear as I took a deep breath of her cherry scent before my lips spread below, and my tongue sought her taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled back to stare at her vivid eyes and found her needy features calling for desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I warned you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted, and mine collided onto their lush and rich texture. Like a crazed bastard, I kissed her unkindly and deeply. Our bodies synced as we pushed against each other with strict orders to draw pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, I&#39;m going to fuck you raw,&#34; I vowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra moaned into my mouth, and her hands desperately clasped my hair. The point of her knife poked my nape, and a tremble coursed down my back. I could have come from its depravity, but instead, I let it fuel me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand rashly fell, tugging the skintight black material of her tights down until they reached her mid thighs. I couldn&#39;t wait to free the pants off her body. I spread her legs apart with my knee and cupped her fully with my palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wet, warm, and sensitive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers rolled and spread easily over her wet folds, causing her legs to buckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled darkly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you,&#34; she gritted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed two fingers up her walls, and she cried out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t given her time to adjust. I took and smiled at her pinched brows and the agony that brought her pleasure. Curling my fingers, I explored, stretched, and fucked her pain and delight while my thumb pressed brutally into her swollen bud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra&#39;s dagger clattered onto the floor as her hands ran furiously over my neck, chest, and arms, pulling and crumpling my suit jacket in tight fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, fuck me, the demon snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her, kissed her, and peered down at my hand that disappeared inside her. I repeated the same barbaric steps, needing to see her beautiful need in her features, to taste and trap her pants, and feel her heat sliding between my fingertips as wetness ran down my palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Massimo,&#34; Alessandra sobbed, begging for my torture to ease and her body to release the evil pressure. &#34;Please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First, I need to taste you, cara mia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled my fingers away. Alessandra breathed out a whine as her head fell back, exposing her neck. I took the offer and kissed its exquisite grooves eagerly while lifting and holding her close. She rocked against me, and I moaned at the excruciating pressure on my dick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my gun in my hand and the other on her ass, I drew away from the wall with her in tow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay her heaving body above the workout bench, removed her clothes, and took in the scattered welts on her flesh. Enraged, I spread her wide for my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our eyes met for a brief second before I dove my mouth into her pussy. She jerked, and the thin bench didn&#39;t allow her writhing. I placed one leg over my shoulder. I pushed her chest back by taking her nipple between my fingertips and held her hip with a bruising hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra was bare before me, a sight I couldn&#39;t have fathomed in this lifetime by such beauty and irresistible vision. All mine for the taking. To do as I please, as it begged for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mad with hunger and thirst, I unleashed my need by eating her out until my raving brought her to tears. Famished, I lapped, slurped, and dipped. Starved with no end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Massimo!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her piercing cry howled in despair for a release. As her walls tightened and her back arched, I pinched her bud between my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra came in heavy shudders, and before she could ride it over my face, I crawled up her body, rubbing her heat and capturing her hard nipple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her ass tried to finish her bliss by pushing her warmth deeper and frantically over my hand, but I wanted to leave her pussy glowing and aching for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slid her body sideways so that only a fraction of her back laid over the low bench cushion. Her eyes shot down at the sound of my buckle and zipper coming undone, and when I freed my dick, she swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thrust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My groan was short compared to her cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra&#39;s knuckles whitened as she held onto the edge while I drove deep and hard inside her. With each thrust of my hips, I punished her defiance, spirit, and gorgeous body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I punished her because, now that I&#39;ve taken her, I wanted no one else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t take her graceful and pleasurable-ridden face anymore. I pulled out, stood, and turned her body into a perfect down V. Her ass taunted me while I got rid of my jacket and loosened my tie in a rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no leverage when I plunged deep into her heat, and her face fell onto the cushion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mio Dio!&#34;My God, she screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Dio.&#34;Not God, I said between thrusts. &#34;Il tuo re.&#34; Your king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Agreeing, Alessandra met my violent strokes erratically. Needily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slaps of our flesh mixed with our feverish sounds, an erotic melody that ran over my body in ecstasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come, mia regina,&#34; I gritted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met my hips one last time. I took over, gripping her hair back and snaking my hand to her chest, bringing her curving back to my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Massimo!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her walls gripped me inside, taking me even deeper. Alessandra let go. One more thrust and I followed with my own release, kissing and biting her back, shoulders, and neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I then released her and tucked myself back into my pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra&#39;s legs buckled, and her hands caught her body from slamming onto the bench. I smirked as her muscles spasmed to keep her upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fished for my handkerchief. Blood stained one side from pressing my wound earlier. I flipped it, and clean white shined through. I stepped closer to her. Alessandra&#39;s legs shook, but she managed to stand. With her back to me, I slid between her legs, curling my arm to her front and wiping away our release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm.&#34; Sore and sensitive, she hummed, squeezing her long legs together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra turned, her satisfied and tired eyes meeting mine, but my brows creased at the sight of the wetness that had spilled from her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I warned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t do sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t do gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I was going to fuck her raw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the tears contradicted how her body withered beneath mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wiped them away with my thumb. Even after warning her, I didn&#39;t warn myself of the fact of causing her pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are not what you think.&#34; She breathed out shakily and bit her lip, pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dio, Massimo!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by the sudden fright in her eyes, I stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re bleeding!&#34; she explained, bringing her bare skin back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked over my arm where my white shirt clung to fresh blood. My movements had revived the blood flow that had stopped earlier, but now it was sweeping through my body in an angry manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra&#39;s fingers ran cautiously over my shoulder and onto my bicep. Her eyes fixed on mine, and her head shook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbuttoning my shirt, I said, &#34;It&#39;s just a graze. I took care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Them. I took care of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slipped off my shirt, and her eyes swept over the furious red mark and veered to the rest of my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were labored, and as her hand flew to meet my body with care, I took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, she pulled her hand to her naked chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I warned you,&#34; I expressed coldly. &#34;I fuck without feelings.&#34; Like a gun flare, hurt flashed in her irises, a quick flash of abuse I felt nothing for as I&#39;d promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her fault. She&#39;d done it to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked my gun up from the bench, uncocked the loaded gun, slipped the safety back on, and returned it to its holster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced and left her accusing gaze and ordered as I walked away, &#34;Put your clothes on and go to bed, Alessandra. I got shit to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Alessandra remained silent. Not one word or sound was heard as I left the basement. Maybe I had finally broken her spirit. Maybe I had made her understand who I was. But every step I took further away from where I had left her, fucked and punished, a confusing and unsettling feeling set in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I fucking hated her for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ALESSANDRA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That bastard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t cry, Alessandra, I chanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering my eyes, I caught sight of the leftover release that had smeared over my thighs and its faint tint of pink. I took a deep breath through my nose as emotion rose, and as time passed, the harder it became to ignore the pain in my body and heart. The beating it had taken from the blows of a former enforcer. The raw and sore muscles of Massimo&#39;s thrusts and the burning of my lips didn&#39;t compare to the thought of being used.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You wanted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You asked for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only did I go against his orders, I voluntarily placed myself in front of Elio&#39;s fists. And I eagerly begged Massimo to take me, own me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I didn&#39;t regret it, I didn&#39;t think about how I would feel afterward.</p>

                <p>I wouldn&#39;t be. He just didn&#39;t know it yet.</p>
