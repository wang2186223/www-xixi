                <p>I picked up his suit jacket with a smirk and a purpose, left my clothes behind, and walked away wrapped in his jacket with my blades securely at my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had once felt like a broken feeling now made me smile. I&#39;d at least gained the respect of Elio. And sex with Massimo left me wanting more, even if every step was filled with soreness and pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I liked pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I left the basement of torture, Wix and Vine were gone from where I&#39;d left them. A part of me knew they&#39;d followed their master, and with heavy steps, I made it to our bathroom without any peering eyes catching my wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two Tylenol and a burning bubble bath later, I assessed my body in front of a mirror. It wasn&#39;t pretty. Not when an iron fist had buried its way into my ribs, the most painful bruise of all. Then, there were faint fingerprints scattered over my hips, bottom, and thighs. A reminder of what sexual intercourse meant with Massimo. Oddly, I was okay with the marks. For once, I did not cower or feel the need to cover them. They didn&#39;t make me feel weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It proved that I could hold my own against Elio, someone I&#39;d been asked not to provoke on multiple occasions. And how Massimo&#39;s fingerprints were nothing more than his need for me. How he may say he fucked without feelings, but my body suggested otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo fucked me with passion, feverishly, and while he hadn&#39;t been my first, he sure left my body addicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my mind reeling in ways to find him for another dose, I walked out in a thin camisole of satin and lace. In need of making him see I was more than just one of his many fucks. To feel his hands on my body and our bodies dancing with need. Each scenario felt inadequate to crush the dark aura that roamed inside and out of that basement. The same aura that followed him like a prisoner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never made it out of the room. Because at times, opportunities fell in front of you, giving you the upper hand. Just like the one I&#39;d received as Massimo crossed the threshold of our door with two heavy legged fur balls close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit down on my bottom lip, hiding my eagerness for his touch and the giddiness of our games to begin. After all, they&#39;ve become compelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo left Wix and Vine by the closed door as he walked past me with a pile of rumpled clothes in his hands. He didn&#39;t offer me a word or a glance. His attention was aimed straight at the bathroom door. As the door swung open, so did my body. With his back to me, Massimo tossed the clothing into the hamper in the cabinet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, I didn&#39;t follow your orders, and you picked up the clothes you so eagerly took off my body from the cold concrete basement floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suppressed a chuckle. I had felt so hurt and used by him that I&#39;d defied him in spite, but I never thought he would pick it all back up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That chuckle quickly died as his hand gripped his holstered gun and his pants fell from his hips, leaving me to take in his broad shoulders, back, ass, and bare legs for the first time. I didn&#39;t deter my gaze, and he wasn&#39;t one for modesty. The one thing I could depend on, and I didn&#39;t mind. Not. One. Bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo twisted his body, and my gaze trailed over every move his muscles made. From the way they jumped with his powering steps to the way they ran down his arm as he placed the weight of his gun against the chilled marble top. All with controlled force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took one step, then another until my hips pressed against the doorframe, captivated by his bare, inked body while he acted as if he was alone. Too soon, the spray of running water filled the room, and Massimo left my vision to drown his demons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But demons could only be muffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fought between my mind and body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One said, &#34;Go to bed.&#34; The other begged, &#34;One more taste.&#34; And yet my soul craved something terrifying, so I followed my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked deeper into the bathroom, slipped my camisole off my body, and entered the steaming shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his back facing me, I followed the water drops that licked down his body. The way they gently rushed down his strength and flowed to his hips, wishing it would be my fingertips that felt such skin. I knew Massimo wouldn&#39;t allow such touch, but I didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing, Alessandra?&#34; Massimo asked a second too late. My fingers already wrestled the water for his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Initiating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head dipped, and his body moved away from my touch. In that second, it only made me crave it more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if that&#39;s the case, my dick is hard. You can start there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to laugh and smack him at the same time. I shook the violence he pried off me and ignored him and his rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was smart. There were other ways to touch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up Massimo&#39;s body wash, I smirked as I lathered my hands with the soap and watched the ink lines of his back teasing me. With palms ready to hold and fingertips eager to explore, I pushed my hands outwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Either you take me for a fool, or you think I can&#39;t smell body wash.&#34; Massimo faced me, and my hands connected to his abdomen. The shock quickly faded, and I ran my hands up over the defined valley of his torso.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither.&#34; I met his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands clasped my wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34; Massimo&#39;s voice sharpened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You say that a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And yet, you never listen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;It&#39;s just soap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest rumbled, and he closed his eyes. Massimo was losing his patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes veered to his wound. It no longer bled, but I hated how close to his chest it was. While my bruises didn&#39;t bother me, his did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Submerging my head fully beneath the water drops, I closed the distance until my lips touched and caressed what my hands couldn&#39;t. I kissed next to the angry gash and peppered another right below then tiptoed up to kiss just above it. Like his enemy, gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t, and it drove him mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He firmly pushed me away and into the tiled wall, impatient to remove my lips from his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to bed,&#34; he ordered, facing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our bodies cooled by the corner as the water hit everywhere but our skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened my body, watching him as leftover droplets ran down his hardened features. A walking wet dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here naked before you, and yet, you deny me?&#34; I baited him, but truth mingled with my words, causing his jaw to shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No man can deny a naked woman, Alessandra.&#34; He bared his teeth. &#34;Is that what you were looking for?&#34; he asked, pinching my chin upward. &#34;To fuck?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored his question, seeking another answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any naked women?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingertips left my chin, taking the crook of my neck fiercely instead. He pulled me closer so I could feel his hard dick that was pressed against my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even while my mouth dried and my legs ached for friction, I couldn&#39;t lose control. Not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I peered into his eyes. He had been watching me all along, hot and interested by my tells, by my cues. Right now, I only wanted an answer, so I waited. Greedy, even if it was in vain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Their woman,&#34; he replied. &#34;You.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His. He couldn&#39;t deny his woman. Me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corner of my lips tightened, a small triumphant smile bound to appear. However, Massimo quickly stretched his thumb to its outline, smearing it away and toying with my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t. I&#39;m merely following my promise to respect you.&#34; To me, it was enough. &#34;Now.&#34; His eyes followed his thumb&#39;s movement as it tugged my bottom lip down. &#34;Get on your knees.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our eyes connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My knees fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I licked my lips when all I saw was him. Ready. I was going to drive him wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took him as far as I could and sucked long and hard down and then up his length until the back of my head hit the wall behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, so fucking slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tongue played. My cheeks burned and my lips tugged at him tightly, but my speed never changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breathing changed, charged with deep misery. The same misery his dick endured. All for my gain. The tug of war, the cat and mouse, and the king and queen game we excelled at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fight for control we both wanted, but neither of us could beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo groaned loudly, and both hands moved to my head as his feet stepped back. I knew what was coming next, but I had other plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even then, I wasn&#39;t prepared for his force or the gag that followed. Or the next as he used my mouth for his pleasure. I quite enjoyed his slip of control and the tears that threatened. I was one step ahead, and I restrained the next pull, restoring my old pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We fought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep doing that. It only makes me harder feeling you resist me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He liked the fight but hated not being the one in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, I won when a deep, guttural, and rough sound slipped out of his mouth. He pulled out, picked me up, and pushed our bodies against the wall to kiss me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo kissed me as if he&#39;d been possessed with need. Carnal and hungry, his lips took mine. His hand gripped my face deeply while the other held my ass tightly, bringing me to his bulge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body gave into his hold, melted into his kiss, and grasped for more. I&#39;d lost sight of my motives, my plan, and I held on to every dose of his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our kiss deepened, and I breathed him in, slipping my fingers in his hair and holding on to his neck. On their own, my lips slowed. They turned gentle, and for a brief moment, his did too. They mimicked mine, craving the peace mine offered. For that mere second, he let me in without acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warfare returned, deadlier than ever. Eyes blazing, strikes loaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo&#39;s hand found my center, spreading my thighs apart with his leg until he flicked my sensitive bud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whimpered from his touch, sensitive from our earlier encounter and responsive to our current game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo didn&#39;t move, my legs already shaking with anticipation. &#34;I have to ask.&#34; He shook his head. &#34;No. I need to know,&#34; he corrected himself. His lips lingered on mine before our eyes locked. &#34;How long has it been?&#34; He cupped me in warning. &#34;And don&#39;t lie to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How much could I say? Men in our world expected a wife to be only theirs for their plucking. Virgins and inexperienced for their corruption. Pure and docile for their doctoring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t a virgin, even if I was inexperienced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t pure or docile. I was already broken before I could be either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A while,&#34; I breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long is a while?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the truth. It had been years. My first time was only memorable because I had decided on the random and lucky bastard who would take my virginity. Not my family. Not the famiglia. Me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo nodded as if he had already expected my answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you&#34;</p>
