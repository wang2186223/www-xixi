                <p>Slowly his eyes lifted, and I closed the gap between my lips. With each exchange, it was becoming difficult to resist my desires. For my heart to beat in calm cadence and to keep my legs from squirming by just his stare. As much as I wanted to hate him, Massimo&#39;s dangerous lure kept holding me tighter, closer, and more aware of my needs as a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He may have been a man of few words who lacked emotion, but right now, his eyes didn&#39;t hide the hunger that swirled in his irises. Right now, he wanted me to see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was no fool of the wants of a man, and I wondered how long before he would lose his control and demand what he could&#39;ve had since the first night I lay in his bed. But Massimo hadn&#39;t acted, pushed, or insinuated anything out of me. It was evident that he found me desirable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any man in our world would&#39;ve taken it long ago. Why wasn&#39;t he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a way, I was thankful. I wouldn&#39;t have been ready then, but now my body has sparked curiosity. Longing. But in our unorthodox arrangement, it meant a lethal mix of hate, sex, and blood. A hysteria that not only tempted but also warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have a minute?&#34; My voice hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo walked closer. The few wrinkles scattered over his black shirt and rolled sleeves caught my attention. He hadn&#39;t changed. He had just arrived home. Somehow, his rugged appearance and the fullness of his beard from an extra day added to his appeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo made it difficult even after a long night&#39;s look, and I struggled to remember why I looked for him in the first place. Struggled surrounded by his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we both stood on the covered stone patio while thunder neared and the wind whistled between us, I had his full attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A disturbing concern of knowing where he&#39;d been all night left me perplexed by such interest. I would be a fool to ignore its meaning, and yet I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are a few things I need.&#34; I hesitated. If he&#39;d been in such a foul mood over a streetlamp, my timing could have been better than starting this conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on.&#34; But the hunger that continued to fail to hide behind his eyes gave me the go ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some stuff I can order online, others I prefer to pick up in person.&#34; I started with the easiest subject. Security, and how far I could push the limits he wouldn&#39;t voice about my freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing. Massimo gave up on nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Define things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I traveled light, Massimo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clothes and essentials.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Order what you can. I can take you for what you can&#39;t tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can drive myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not traveling alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never said alone.&#34; Massimo&#39;s brow rose, so I clarified. &#34;I don&#39;t remember a time when I didn&#39;t travel without a shadow. I just meant I could take myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amusement twitched the corner of his lips. &#34;And how many times did you lose such a shadow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer. He would see right through the lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I said, I can take you tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine. I gave up and moved on to the real topic I wanted to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth, ready to strike my next bargain, but I was interrupted by the ringing of his phone. His jaw locked, and he let go of my eyes as he looked down at the screen. It rang three times more before he silenced it. Massimo didn&#39;t return his attention to me. Instead, his gaze passed through the glass doors behind me. I saw his mind reeling. Far from our conversation with the stress of his day to day and something else I couldn&#39;t grasp. It was unsettling. How much he carried and imprisoned inside. The way he hid it all, showing no emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first drops of water splattered against the stones while others splashed loudly into the pool. More followed, faster, heavier. Awakening the scent from the earth I loved so much. I closed my eyes briefly, taking a deep breath and allowing the calming smell to wash over me. I shouldn&#39;t have because it soothed my thoughts, pacified my heart, and eased my will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I was back in the trance of his gaze while I felt vulnerable and exposed. Massimo combed his fingers through his hair, and took another step closer, then another. Even with the twists of the wind, my breathing shortened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, Alessandra?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My name sounded powerful on his lips. My name sounded tempting on his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted so much, but for now, I wanted to make a deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Access to downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His unconcealed displeasure was bare. &#34;Why?&#34; he asked cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo already knew my answer. The workout clothes I was wearing said enough, but his mistrust was clear and always nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I will make you trust me, Lombardi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t exercised since I arrived.&#34; I kept my explanation short. Less for him to read and pick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play me for a fool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not, but I figured it would be the safest place. Within your walls and eyes, among your men, than finding a gym where new people come and go.&#34; I meant it, but I hadn&#39;t kept my reply short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo shook his head, but he didn&#39;t say a word. His mind processed and thought out all scenarios to keep control from my request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he gave me something. It could be taken as power and patience. The ability to think through all outcomes and loopholes. I could see it as a possible weakness. His need for control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every strength could be a weakness when put into a different perspective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruling over his thoughts, I took a step closer. A move that risked but could also gain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gamble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest now bounced against his while my head leaned back to not miss a sign. But his lips were near, and his scent was unforgiving, and I found myself in his web. Tangled by all of him, trapped in his appeal.</p>
