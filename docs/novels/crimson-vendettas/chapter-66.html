                <p>I held them and smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will do no such thing!&#34; He stood straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before you leave,&#34; I stated. &#34;I requested this meeting only for one reason, and that was to inform all that Miami&#39;s borders are closed. Therefore any visit into my city would be treated as a threat and eliminated as such.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My words carried power, action. A clear warning of execution if bridged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Until this threat is resolved, we are all at risk,&#34; I added as if I cared for their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have my vote. Close it down,&#34; Alfonzo spoke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giuliani&#39;s nose twitched in ire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zanetti?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The safety of my daughter is a priority, sì.&#34; A lie I ignored after hearing his vote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giuliani&#39;s breathing deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Santoni?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luigi stared at his empty wineglass before he looked at me. Full lips quivered as sweat poured from trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Giuliani.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Checkmate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need my vote.&#34; With a sneer, Giuliani turned and left the quiet room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was my cue to leave. Because while I wished to stay until the surge of victory could subside inside, I had corralled Giuliani into action, and I was still states away from home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Alessandra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gentlemen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked away without any further words to give. No nods, handshakes, or closed smiles to offer. I got what I wanted. Miami was now a no-man&#39;s-land. I was free to kill anyone without question, no matter of title or affiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had work to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elio kept up with my pace as we moved through the corridor. Chatter grew the closer we got to the main room, and as I turned to take the side exit we&#39;d entered, I stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Massimo?&#34; Elio asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I circled around until I found Beatrice&#39;s surprised face behind the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want a bottle to go.&#34; I pulled a billing card from my jacket. &#34;And a box delivered to this address.&#34; I tapped it. &#34;Charge it to that information.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slid the card across the bar and her pixie cut swayed in agreement. Beatrice quickly left to retrieve my order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously?&#34; Elio scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir.&#34; The male waiter stepped next to me. &#34;A female from earlier left me her business card for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked down at the paper between us and took it as Beatrice returned with the bottle I&#39;d asked. The card read Emily Davis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; I grabbed the bottle and made my way out of the building and into the hot Texas air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a few steps before fishing for my phone and making the first call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Da.&#34; Yeah. Nate answered in Russian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not leave the house. Eyes open and above,&#34; I replied, hung up, and moved to the second call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zdarova.&#34;What&#39;s up? Vadim mumbled in Russian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There may be trouble. Stay in my house if needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; Vadim&#39;s voice cut off, and I moved on to my last call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pronto,&#34; Dario answered, Italian heavy in his tongue as loud female moans filtered through the receiver. &#34;Boss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell Rana, Fer, and Mimmo that they are needed in Yamal&#39;s perimeter. Get Beppe to fucking do something too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver and Renzo&#39;s men are already covering-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do as I ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended the call and hopped inside the car. Elio turned the ignition, the engine purred to life, and I closed my eyes for a brief minute. I needed a drink, and I didn&#39;t mean wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did it not go as you planned?&#34; Elio asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did. It was the best outcome and scenario I could&#39;ve fabricated. I now just needed to see a set of vivid greens full of life to finally escape from the adrenaline and burning blood that had taken over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped the bottle and smiled. Damn cherries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ALESSANDRA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clock read past eleven, and Massimo hadn&#39;t returned home or called. While I hadn&#39;t asked about his last-minute trip to Texas, I noticed after arriving home that Elio was gone too. They&#39;d left together. That alone spoke of how crucial it was for them both to leave the city without its boss and underboss. It also showed the limited number of people aware of their absence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I&#39;d gathered and roped around the missing pieces, and understood how private this meeting was, I was growing impatient by his silence. I worried about his safety as time passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly dread swept inside, creeping through the cracks of my dimmed thoughts. The loneliness only grew with the darkness inside the room. The one friend I&#39;d counted on now hunted me with visions I&#39;d only dreamed of. All conspiring, to my dismay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d tried to occupy my mind by sketching on my tablet. However, as I held the cool and thin touch-screen pencil, the feel of my stringer-knife and its thin needle blade took its place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My grip loosened with small trembles, and I closed my eyes. It slipped as I broke into a cold sweat, dampening my hands. But instead of cold chills traveling over my body, I felt warm sap over my hands. I snapped my eyes only to see red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scurried away from its feel, shaking it off and wiping my palms over the white bedsheet, and while they were clean, the ghost&#39;s blood lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, no, no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dreams were brushing into reality. Stirring memories of bloodbath and recreating scenes I couldn&#39;t flee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tossed the tablet and pencil to the side, and searched for my phone. I looked at it one last time in case I&#39;d missed his call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Needy to escape in his voice and calm demeanor, I tucked my pillow tight to my chest and lay over the mattress, watching as my phone mocked without his name written on its screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vine, Wix,&#34; I called out to my two beasts and patted the bed for them to get on it, unable to wait alone with my mind tricks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly they both jumped, and the bed dipped under their weight. They tossed and circled around its edge trying to find space for them both. Wix flopped, and pinned my hips down as he laid his head over them. Vine snarled and shoved his nose to Wix&#39;s neck in an attempt to move him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop fighting,&#34; I cooed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vine growled and grumpily laid next to him, pushing me down onto the bed to place his head on my torso.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I huffed under their weight, and their bodies heated. Maybe Massimo was right. They were too big for our bed, too heavy to be treated as lap dogs. But at this moment, their warmth and long coat calmed the roars in my chest, gently easing death&#39;s shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid still, pinned beneath their frame, wide eyed and fingertips stroking their fur to replace the sin-even if it was temporary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For nights, I&#39;d relived that night, and maybe I wasn&#39;t as strong as I thought I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had killed a total of three men in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first wasn&#39;t intended. I hadn&#39;t been the one who&#39;d bled him to death. Dante did, but I was the only reason for his death. Not once did I ponder over his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second was a poor bastard who&#39;d stolen from me. My grandfather ordered his hunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one steals from a Zanetti, dolcezza.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sent to condemn him to death by identifying him. Without batting an eye, I watched as they beat him to a pulp, but as his screams grew, I took the gun my grandfather had offered and ended his misery. My grandfather didn&#39;t shy me away from the ugly. Instead, he taught me to embrace it. He wasn&#39;t a kind man, but to me, Nonno&#39;s treatment almost showed care. Care to acknowledge the blood that ran through my veins and the weight my last name carried. Nonno&#39;s attention was the closest thing to affection I&#39;d experienced. At twenty-two, I believed death brought us closer. As if I&#39;d gained his respect as a woman by taking the life of a man who&#39;d threatened our reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s death was fast, simple, and not a night passed without me losing sleep over it. After all, I was broken, or so I&#39;d thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the intimate way I&#39;d taken the life of the third that night at the gala. Or the way I watched his eyes void of life while I sitting in ire calm, in a puddle of his blood. Immersing myself in his essence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe what really haunted me was myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way I&#39;d disconnected and slipped into the thirsty fog of inhumanity. Either way, evil consumed my spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone ranged and I answered, closing my eyes.</p>
