                <p>I loosened my hold and stretched my arms, crossing them around his neck. I would give him what he wanted, even if I didn&#39;t understand his intentions. Because a part of me was curious where it could lead. But I couldn&#39;t see his eyes anymore, and instead of looking into his black shirt, I rested my cheek against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weak moment, but one I enjoyed with his scent so near.</p>

                <p>His tense body didn&#39;t relax. Indifferent to our current position while I felt the opposite. It was time I made him feel uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you said, Massimo, dogs are smart. You think they don&#39;t sense your stiff posture?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two could play the game. I just had to keep reminding myself to not lose to the main player.</p>

                <p>&#34;I like the way I&#39;m holding you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingertips dug into my hips, positioning them deeper into his middle. While I felt his excitement through our clothes for the first time, I&#39;d lost any reason because now I wanted to stay rooted right where I was. Feeling the reaction of his body toward mine, the desire I had brought him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth spread over me in heat waves as the room&#39;s air stifled and I&#39;d grown parched and in need of relief from the oppressive ache between my legs. Bearing the need for a deeper breath, I wet my now dried lips. An experience so new that my reactions were delayed between confusion and angst. Giddy even. I wanted to be brave and embrace the delicious torture of my chest rubbing against his as his fingers handled into his mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as my body rolled in scorching shivers, his body remained as stiff as his dick. As my body heaved in blazing neediness, he stood cool and collected and indifferent. As my eyes glowed with desire, his eyes remained cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, hold me as I&#39;m holding you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Massimo had to do was entwine his arms around my waist, but instead, his chest bounced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re laughing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo had turned his face away from view, and I only caught the twitch of his lips before he faced me again. The only humor left was the faint trace in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You believed that I would take an order from you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jerked me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I prefer if you begged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, I drew back, twisting away from his grip and far away from reach. Of course it didn&#39;t bother him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to allow Massimo&#39;s touch to cloud my mind and prey over the dangerous desires that intensified each time with temptation, I let go of his eyes. I watched Wix and Vine as they worked through our encounter and focused on them instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I extended both of my palms to each one and waited as they carefully watched my move. Slowly, they came closer as I left fear behind. I offered them no threat in such a position, and they sniffed my hands, and their wet nose nudged them for them to turn. I did, and soon I had my fingers entwined in their soft and thick coats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, peace and trust. Too bad their master was a harder breed of dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it means less people inside the house, you should&#39;ve brought them back sooner.&#34; My back straightened, releasing my gaze away from the four-paw weapons that I now considered pups, and I asked, &#34;What time are we leaving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, he flicked his wrist with a quick glance at his watch and replied, &#34;Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MASSIMO</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yamal was backfrom the quick business trip I&#39;d entrusted him with, and he was standing next to Dario&#39;s blacked out SUV. Dario and Yamal weren&#39;t capos, but as they both worked so close to Elio and me, their enforcer title had more weight than most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked down to the stone circular drive while I waited for Alessandra. I had a few things that needed to be understood before we left for the city. When she excused herself to the restroom, I saw the perfect time without her watchful eyes and perceptive mind near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My car was parked in front of their vehicle, but I headed straight for them instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss,&#34; Yamal said as Dario nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure Dario briefed you of what you&#39;ve missed.&#34; I picked a cigarette out of my case and rolled it between my fingers. &#34;That being said, you&#39;ll be Alessandra&#39;s shadow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The severity of my words was evident as I stared into his eyes. This wasn&#39;t an easy thing to do. To place such trust in someone other than my brothers. But I needed him to get her to safety if we ever encountered a threat. His life depended on keeping her safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially after Elio confirmed we&#39;ve lost sight of Leandro Giuliani, the next in line of Los Angeles. The man with the burn-marked hands. His disappearance from California only proved his involvement in the lives taken in Miami. He was here doing his father&#39;s dirty work quietly while Giuliani Sr. sat comfortably in his throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yamal was in his late twenties, always on high alert, and agile in hand-to-hand combat. Dario brought him in at a young age. Taught him the rules. Preached to him of honor and respect until Yamal&#39;s mind only saw the mafioso way. By the time he swore his life to Miami, he was no longer the same kid. He was a made-man who towered over his older cousin by a few inches. He had no distractions at home. Yamal lived and breathed for the Lombardi family now. Even if he ever found someone to wait for his return at night, the Mafia was first, followed by God, then his weaknesses would come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34; Yamal seemed surprised, confused even. &#34;As you wish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not a punishment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never crossed my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And yet you seem&#34; I fought for the right word, but nothing came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not good with women.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not asking you to be her friend. Your duty is to keep her safe.&#34; I took a step closer and twirled the cigarette into my palm. &#34;Are you capable of that, Yamal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Wherever she goes, you go. When you can&#39;t, Dario will step up. However, Elio and I need him on the streets, and you are the only other one I can see capable of such a task.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suggest you get comfortable with Vine and Wix quickly. They are back, and you&#39;ll be spending more time insid-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The loud snap of the front door shutting interrupted me. I turned to its sound and watched Alessandra&#39;s long hair swirl in the breeze. Her enchanting green eyes caught mine as she slowly stepped down to meet me. I appreciated the way her legs looked in her heels inside my study, but now they caught the sunray&#39;s glow. Her tanned skin urged us to leave. Because I still felt my dick twitch at the thought of how she felt pressed against me. How quickly I was losing my composure around her. How I wanted nothing more than to claim her in my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandra.&#34; I pocketed the cigarette and stretched my hand outwards. Alessandra took a quick look at it before she took it, and I brought her closer until her posture mirrored mine by my side. &#34;You&#39;ve met Dario and Yamal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faced them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sure she remembered the day she met them. It was in New York. The day her father dismissed her without a farewell and gave her to a mafia boss he considered an enemy. But she no longer bared the marks left by him on her face. They were now only a foul memory. Yet not one I would forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not properly. Alessandra Zanetti.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zanetti. My jaw locked, annoyed by her introduction, and she stretched her hand out for them with a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dario.&#34; He shook her hand gently and let it go. &#34;Pleasure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yamal took her hand more carefully, as if she would wound him with just a touch. Perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yamal.&#34; He scratched his throat and dropped his hand. Distant. That was what he wanted to portray. Afraid I would see anything more than respect for what was mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A pleasure meeting you both,&#34; Alessandra said politely and wrapped her arm around my bicep. I looked down at her, careful of her intentions, but there was nothing but curiosity. &#34;Ready?&#34;</p>
