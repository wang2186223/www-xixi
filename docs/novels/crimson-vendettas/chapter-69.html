                <p>With one hand grasping the arm of his chair and the other holding tightly onto the screen, I uttered onto his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to fuck.&#34; I evaded him quickly and continued my ruse. &#34;But first.&#34; I nudged the device against him. &#34;I don&#39;t like it when my time is wasted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes closed, taking a deep breath, and I smiled as his patience thinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The joys of driving him mad was seeing it firsthand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have three minutes before I bury my dick deep into you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened by his threatening tone, and when he opened his eyes, he&#39;d meant every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I omitted my argument and quickly opened the file I&#39;d saved of my sketch. His eyes lowered to the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two minutes,&#34; he said coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To avoid missing a beat, I spoke in rapid Italian. &#34;The structure downstairs, your work area, is a death trap. The only exit, or entrance, is the door that can only be accessed through the staircase. It&#39;s a disadvantage in case of an ambush. But to avoid someone coming in through a full-sized door in the corner, the grounds outside are suitable for a half-sized side exit that can be stretched out into the property and can be hidden even from the outside. The frame and beams can hold the change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers swiped to the next slide and traced the outside corridor that could be overseen by a small man-made mountain of bushes and greenery until reaching the outskirts to safety. I dared a quick look at him. He was listening and following every word that I fired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While I highly think it&#39;s taking the words extreme caution to another level, as if someone could be as suicidal to attempt a hit on your own property. But your title and our way of living doesn&#39;t allow any measures or risks to be ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve built this manor, this fortress to fit you and your men. However, you and I know what the future and your position will require. What&#39;s my duty, and what I should bear in our world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo stood as fast as my heart beat once. With his body pressed against mine and the outline of his hard dick straining against my abdomen, his fingertips trailed until they curled with a large fist of my hair. He tipped my head back to fix his eyes on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened with gleaming fire, and I stood surprised by his abrupt change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do it.&#34; His free hand took my tablet, tossing it to his desk. A rattle crashed as objects fell onto the ground by the force of the device, and his hands caged me as they held on to me. &#34;Now your time is up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His leg spread mine apart, raising my dark blue dress until it stretched to its limit. I clutched onto the arms that held me, but soon they both fell as he freed his shaft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all so quick, sudden and erratic as if I&#39;d sparked a violent might to take me. Right here and now. No kiss, no touch, just an aggressive want to sink deep into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo lifted my dress higher to spread me even further. His hand bruised my ass, lifting it from the ground, and setting me over his desk to align with his hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His finger curled around the thin strap of my lace underwear, and a short rip echoed sharply with our breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thrust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raw and brutal, I took him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; I gasped and clawed at his covered shoulders. &#34;Massimo,&#34; I begged for a second, but Massimo didn&#39;t give me time to adjust, instead he pounded again, deeper, and roughly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweet pain and ecstasy rolled in rabid waves as he lowered my back to his desk. His palms hooked under my knees, opening me wide to his vicious strokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many will you gift me, cara mia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked as I bucked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many, mia regina?&#34; His hand slipped until his fingers grasped my throat tightly, demanding an answer, but my eyes held his, watching as they raged out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, not understanding and missing what ran through his mind without an answer to give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me!&#34; he roared, and his punishment continued in savage beats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm!&#34; I whimpered as his dick hit over and over aggressively into the blissful spot only he&#39;d discovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many versions of you will mix with my blood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth parted with realization. I tipped Massimo over his consuming need with the slight hint of our future, kids. My gasps grew weak with the stray air I mustered inside my lungs, and I flung my hands over his face. And while his hips pounded repeatedly, my hands were the opposite. They were gentle against his jaw, as my fingertips caressed his lips and scratched over the prickles of his short beard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As many as it will take to fill the halls with chaos!&#34; I shouted through a moan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo leaned down until I tasted whiskey. His hand released my throat as he kissed me, but his hold lingered on my neck. Wild lips matched my own and nips stung as my chest soared, and as our bodies synced, my heart cracked with any remaining barrier left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t respond, it wasn&#39;t needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He too wanted it. He too sought out the same future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone rang, but he didn&#39;t stop causing the pleasurable sounds that escaped me. The ringing stopped only to begin again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck!&#34; he said between my lips, and his hand lowered on my sides, tracing my skin while I met his hips for release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so close, my breathing erratic, my body on fire, and as my throat dried thirsty in gasps, air, and him, I rubbed my pussy against his shaft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm.&#34; A short sound from his chest vibrated onto mine. I enjoyed the feel as I slid and rubbed myself over him. &#34;Now, you must be real quiet.&#34; He smiled wickedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I whined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I doubt you are too busy to answer my call, Lombardi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clamped my mouth shut with my hand as my father&#39;s voice was loud by my ear. I watched the evil smile that Massimo revealed as it yearned for my whimpers, the gasps, or his name called out in pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Extremely,&#34; Massimo answered evenly and composedly, while I couldn&#39;t contain the small whimpers that filtered past my lips and hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, but he pinched down on my nipple causing exquisite pain. My body curved as I attempted to stay quiet, but instead I took him in deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze returned to his, pleading. Massimo&#39;s smile reached his eyes. He wasn&#39;t willing to make it easier on me, if anything he wanted my father to hear me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was sick and depraved the way he wanted to show his claim, and yet, it heightened and fueled my greed. As if it made me want it even more. As if I too wanted him to hear how I enjoyed my time in Miami. How he&#39;d lost the fight to ruin my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m done with games, Massimo. I want a meeting with you before the wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo&#39;s hands moved to my hips, arranging them only to fill me again in a different and harder angle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mio Dio!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet tried to land on any surface for leverage, but my heels made it difficult to rest on anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was at his mercy, with no leverage, and my father&#39;s voice by my ear as our bodies met louder and louder by his thrusts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone grew silent, and even as I tried to breathe out through my nose, I was loud, raspy, and infuriated by holding on to my sounds. The pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll set it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massimo&#39;s mouth found my nipple, and he bit it the same moment his fingers found the swollen sensitivity between my legs, pinching it, until I came with a loud and muffled moan. Tears escaped as I couldn&#39;t let out the intensity of my release any other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone fell into another long silence as Massimo rode my release. &#34;I must go, Zanetti. I have pressing matters to attend to.&#34; The mockery was cruel in his low voice, and yet Massimo still chased his own release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vaffanculo!&#34; Fuck you!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m working on it,&#34; he gritted out, and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head at his triumphant and pleased dark grin. When his lips lowered to catch mine, all I could do was take them in a whimper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three,&#34; his husky voice rasped. &#34;I want at least three.&#34; Then Massimo came in harsh spurts filling me with his cum until his spent and satisfied body hovered over mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three or more,&#34; I promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me one last kiss, and our eyes met. And as I watched the whiskey brown return, he simply said, &#34;Pack a bag, we are leaving tomorrow for a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he was off me and just like that, the lover vanished, and the boss returned as he moved away from my body to compose his appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t wait for me, I will be late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched him in a daze as he left me with his cum running down my legs and onto his desk. But he briefly stopped at the unfinished chess game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to know the irony of chess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? He had just fucked me while my father heard every slipping sound. He&#39;d admitted to the idea of our future-children, and how many. He had just ordered me to pack a bag as I stood on shaky limbs with no further information of where we were traveling, and he wanted to talk about chess?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes briefly swept over me, and he said, &#34;The queen holds more power than the king.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MASSIMO</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running a syndicate on a coastline had its benefits and its disadvantages. It was easier to keep track of the streets, the homes, the roads, and transactions made on soil. But the Atlantic Ocean was my neighbor, and Miami was filled with ports, channels, and many canals to cover and maintain under surveillance. It was tough to know all the cash transactions made on water. Or keep up with the waves of tourism that flooded the piers and harbors with boats. But I did, and I knew every shipment and exchange that took place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, I hadn&#39;t been hunting a simple man but a made-man with endless resources and hiding skills. A careful and sharp-minded individual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d fucking found Leandro. It hadn&#39;t been easy. Yet, this was my city, and eventually the current would drag my victims right into my hands. After connecting Alessandra to the first few dead bodies, Vadim spent most of his time investigating and following through all transactions made on shore and deep waters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The owner of the yacht died seven months ago.&#34; Elio placed his earpiece in. It matched the same Nate had given Vadim and me before we left my home. &#34;His children are fighting the wife for it. They&#39;ve been in court all this time with no settlement made.&#34; Vadim huffed from the driver&#39;s seat. &#34;She saw the cash offer for a rental as an easy yes. No paper trail to lead or harm her in court.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many men stay with him?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Six to seven, including Leandro.&#34; He checked his watch. &#34;We are twelve in total, and everyone is already waiting near the marina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This will be loud.&#34; Attention was the last thing I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Water carried a sound like an echo. Too many ears, too much room for error.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gave Davina&#39;s father a heads up. He&#39;ll hold the response time for five minutes.&#34; Vadim caught my glance from the rearview mirror.</p>
