                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I replied through clenched teeth, annoyed by the painful bulge she&#39;d created and the threat of blue balls she implied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step closer and held her jaw. Her lips had healed, and the bruise by her eye had faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then explain it to me, and after I listen, you will get on your knees and suck me dry.&#34; My fingers squeezed her cheeks. &#34;Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed in violent hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if I don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep playing and find out.&#34; I pushed her back onto the mirror. She hissed on contact with its coolness, but her defiant eyes never wavered. And I knew she wouldn&#39;t stop playing. &#34;You toyed with me from the moment I walked in. You proudly wanted me to see every inch of you in this delicate fucking dream of fabric, and you teased the wrong motherfucker.&#34; I pressed my covered dick against her. &#34;And you will fix it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or I might bite it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned. &#34;I like pain, sweetie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34; Her hand pushed against my chest. &#34;You-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed her sangria-colored lips, but instead of wine, grapes, or citrus flavors, cherry was all I could taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cherry lips, fighting, crashing, delicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they synced and gave as much as they took, I stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me, what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cloudy gaze struggled against mine, and her head fell onto my chest as her hand gripped my suit jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze. It no longer felt like her mind was trying to craft or con. This was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak freely. You don&#39;t have to look at me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You made me fear you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The broken whisper struck brutally, plowing down over the fraud of my beatless heart with a strangling hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was what I had wanted from the moment I agreed to this sham of marriage. However, hearing it from her fragile lips, and yet the strong spirit she was, constricted my breathing. It twisted and gripped me from the inside as if I was on the receiving end of agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I was because the torment in her voice spread through me like bane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You make me question my instincts. You blind me, Massimo.&#34; My hand ran beneath her hair, listening to her accusations and the truth she&#39;d set free. &#34;I don&#39;t recognize who I am anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smart, beautiful, dangerous. She hadn&#39;t changed, if anything she had become a bigger threat than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you done?&#34; I asked, composed, and damn if I didn&#39;t stare at hell when her eyes flared quickly as she glared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listened, Alessandra. You too made me question my actions. You too blinded me. And I too didn&#39;t recognize the man whose thoughts wandered to a fucking woman in the middle of creating a blood painting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t worry about theories I was incapable of feeling, or ideas I didn&#39;t want to be a part of. I liked my life just the way it was. Vacant. Nothing more than her body to sink into and a fucking empire to rule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers spread over her mouth, and I dug my thumb deep and low into her bow lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were loud and clear. Now, you do what I asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Make me show you what will happen if you don&#39;t. Come on Alessandra, another round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish it would&#39;ve never been you,&#34; she spat, aiming to hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s alright. It would be a sixty-year-old dick you sucked instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand quickly fell to her thigh, and her fingers ran across it, finding it empty and stripped of any weapon. I smiled. She sneered, and her fist flung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t think so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped her jaw and shoved her into the mirror, taking her balled fist. Ambers of ire kindled. This wasn&#39;t what I&#39;d come here for. This whole scene wasn&#39;t how I&#39;d envisioned it. How I&#39;d hope to start or finish. Instead, it was fueling and tumbling, deepening into pits of endless hostility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your dagger is one thing, Alessandra, and one I acknowledge I deserve. But don&#39;t ever raise your fucking hand at me, much less your fist unless you want to be treated as a fucking man.&#34; My words touched her flushed face. &#34;And while I don&#39;t fear you, I can lose the small thread of respect I hold for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra&#39;s brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you not just fighting my touch because I caused you pain? Because my hands inflicted fear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lowered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I listened.&#34; Our faces were mere inches apart. &#34;You want to hurt me?&#34; I asked, and her vivid greens fogged. &#34;Do it while you fuck me violently.&#34; I pulled her body closer. &#34;Cut me, bite me, draw blood if that&#39;s what you need, but do it while your mouth chokes on my dick, or while you ride me in pleasure. But never outside of sex. That&#39;s not a marriage I will honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see tears of anger pooling in the brims of her eyes. Her face was dotted with splotches of red, and the veins in her forehead were filled with wrath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand swatted mine off her face, and she gave me what I wanted. Another round. The fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least this time, we both agreed and understood our limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra gripped my blazer, pulled it to her, and turned so my back pressed against the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn. I had a feeling sweet pain would soon arrive in rapids of ecstasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned triumphantly. Alessandra didn&#39;t. She was driven by pure anger and need. Her hands fumbled with my buckle, and as much as I liked watching her temper loose, I wanted another taste of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tugged at her face and my lips sought out for her soft and warm mouth that lingered in dipped cherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drew back and our eyes connected. &#34;Have I mentioned how divine your body is in only high tights and lace?&#34; I pried another kiss. &#34;Or how the color white against your golden skin makes me hard?&#34; I hauled her back for one last taste and groaned when my lip stung painfully by her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; she spat as her hands freed my dick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed her head down with force and shoved her mouth deep as I moved forward with her lips wrapped around my shaft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look who shut up instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes fluttered as she gagged with threatening tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teeth came out to play, and fuck if she didn&#39;t shut me up quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dio, this goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sucked, she fought, and I couldn&#39;t hold on longer with her eagerness to cause pain and pleasure, submitting my request and agreeing to my terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just like that, cara mia.&#34; I hummed, reeling my fingers around her hair, roaming and gripping their thick and smooth texture as her mouth messily kept up with my sharp thrusts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teeth disappeared and her cheeks hollowed, sucking me deeply in and out. I gave in to her tempo and groaned like a little bitch. I wasn&#39;t even bothered by the power she held over my dick, or the desire she drew out just for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her deep tugs pulled my eyes away, forcing me to tilt my head back as my balls tightened. Cazzo, I couldn&#39;t hold my release longer, and Alessandra knew it as she shifted with hands firmly, gripping my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alessandra.&#34; A deep moan clung in my throat, and I emptied my dick into her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took each drop, and did as told, milked me dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked her up by her waist, and her legs immediately clasped around my hips. I kissed her hungrily, and while her cherry taste lingered with a bitter taste, I lavished her mouth and pressed her against the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands clawed and fumbled with my shirt buttons. Our bodies couldn&#39;t wait, and hers thrashed up and down with her dampened lace creating the friction she begged for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take care of you,&#34; I murmured into her ear, and nipped it as her palms ran over my now bare chest as my shirt tumbled to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a nipple into my mouth, sucking, biting and swirling my tongue around its stiff pebble. Alessandra scratched my shoulder, and I bit harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh!&#34; she shouted in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did it again, and this time her fingernails didn&#39;t just scratch but stung as they pierced my chest. In a loud pop, I let go of her nipple as I moaned a groan of the sweet torture she was putting me through. I dropped my head onto her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I lifted my head again, I found her wicked smile and vicious sense of victory. I craned my head slowly, watching her in dark humor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t even begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to make you beg.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her green eyes widened at my promise as her pants escaped rapidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared. I stared, and we both stood still as a classical lullaby played in loops inside the room. It didn&#39;t match our fire, our threats, nevertheless the need that pulsed between us. It had been a second too long away from her body. A second for my promise to scurry and join the notes of peace with the war mine vowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I unchained my demon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was on her like a ravenous predator, flipping her body and pushing her head onto the mirror. Her mouth parted and her breathing dampened the surface by her little suffocating pants, and I dragged her ass to my front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whimpered with large eyes. When I spread her legs with my feet, I traced her sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found the reflection of us. The hand that gripped her hair, forcing her head to the cold mirror. The bow of her back as her nipples teased the glass with spread legs and a perched ass. Sheer stockings, white lace, and a pure fuck-me expression reflected back. All while my heavy hand seized her hip and placed her against my freed shaft. My tattooed covered body was clear under broad light while my rumpled shirt lay on the floor. And while my black pants hung over my ass, the zipper toyed with my erected dick that sought another release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck, this vision would hunt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my body to her back and whispered as our eyes connected through the reflection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to deny me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my eyes trained to her emeralds, I hooked the thin panty lace against my fingers and tugged. A loud and short rip blended with her moan as I pulled the shredded fabric off her sensitive pussy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you?&#34; I asked deeply as I balled the lace into my fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t reply, trying to omit my answer. But I wanted to hear it. I wanted her to cry it out, and for her heart to hear it through its vibrations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Done with the reflection, I wanted to see her body before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted, teasing her entrance while my hold on her hip slithered to between her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alessandra suppressed a moan, closing her eyes, and I slid my fingers through her wet folds. So fucking wet, so responsive, and yet so fucking stubborn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me, Alessandra.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I applied pressure for an answer, and when she still fought, I used the scratchy-soft lace against her bud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still not an answer, cara mia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rubbed in tight circles, causing her legs to buckle and her ass to squirm. When her thighs ached to close, I drove my foot further, leaving her spread for my torture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Massimo,&#34; she implored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that wasn&#39;t the begging I&#39;d promised. I dropped the lace to the floor and dipped a finger deep into her walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pumped, toyed, and smeared herself over her opening repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you still denying what&#39;s mine?&#34; I growled, frustrated by her impertinence of even trying, and the resistance to retract her insolence.</p>
