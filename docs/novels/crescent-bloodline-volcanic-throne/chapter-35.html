                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a staring competition between The Lady Moira with a blank face and Beta Bayoán with a pleasant wide smile... she finally opens a small portal reaching into it and pulls out a sword.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Avalon is here to help by the command of The Goddess.&#34; She comes over to me and I notice she has no scent whatsoever, is she using the same potion the Osupa use?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know why you are being given this sword to execute the criminals?&#34; She asks me plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I link Marcus to see if he knows but I am getting no response from him. The Lady Moira looks at Marcus, shit. He is not well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, your Beta&#39;s mental decay is critical right now, I suggest you take Bayoán&#39;s offered help, besides The Osupa, I sense no mental healer in your pack. The Osupa have many trained and skilled healers, the mind is a hard thing to repair.&#34; And the Priestess voice is soft and comforting and I see yellow light shining from her cloak. I take a deep breath. Can she read minds?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beta Bayoán, I accept your help for my brother&#39;s sake, I will carry out the executions as per Avalon Law and the will of the Goddess.&#34; I feel numb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ura, go ask Sandro who is available to check Beta Marcus&#39;s condition, he is in the tent to the left, they are so many of our pack and victims that we had to clear a tent just for mental health.&#34; I go to Marcus and tap his shoulder and he gives a little jump, he really is on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gotcha! C&#39;mon babe I am showing you off to everyone!&#34; And he pecks her lips and she giggles grabbing his arm. Damn, now I REALLY want my mate, to hear her laugh, to see love in her eyes. At least she is well, her brother Maco will probably have a long wait too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus they are going to get you help, ok? I know this is hard but they seem to know how to help you and probably myself latter.&#34; He looks at me with dead eyes. &#34;C&#39;mon Marcus I need you healthy brother, ok?&#34; And he just nods at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Urayoán comes over: &#34;You are in Luck! Tatiana is waiting for you and she is no apprentice. Alpha, your brother will be in skilled hands, she also wishes to help you should you need her help.&#34; They had a tragedy befall them just yesterday and we who were supposed to help them are helping us instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry to have lashed out at your mate, I don&#39;t know what or who to trust anymore. Also there are more victims in our medical facility that are receiving care, yet some have been... brutalized. Can they get help too?&#34; Marcus once told me that there is no shame asking for help, if he gets back to himself I swear to listen to him always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry Alpha Kayden, those who are responsive with no mayor wounds are receiving therapy right now. Izzy even ordered the most skilled apprentices to join in the efforts, it&#39;s good field experience and they will get extra credits for it.&#34; Bayoán states matter-of-factly. Marcus was right about her, she is young but very capable. I still don&#39;t understand how I got her as a mate! She deserves better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Goddess has paired you with Loiza because only you can give her what she needs and vise versa, if the Goddess has mated you to Loiza I strongly recommend that you keep looking in the Bond and determine her needs, the Goddess is very meticulous when she pairs up mates especially an Alpha.&#34; The Lady Moira tells me, it actually helped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lady I am sorry to ask, can you read minds?&#34; She gives a little smile...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not exactly, if a clear thought is made, especially if it&#39;s related to my duties, I will hear it. But I can look into someone&#39;s mind with my third eye.&#34; I look at her forehead and don&#39;t see any eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you will see latter how it works.&#34; She answers, why is it I don&#39;t know any of this? Damn it mother! You could have at least educated us in these matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Urayoán&#39;s mate Freya comes up to me: &#34;Alpha don&#39;t worry about offending me, I have never felt better! Now Marius is something different. I am not sure how many people he is trafficking and there is a lot of abuse in the pack. And now that I am mated I have all of Ura&#39;s knowledge of why the entire pack is behaving this way.&#34; She informs me. By the Goddess! Has he gone off the deep end? I am aware that Marius is not one to be trusted, but this is insane!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have the manpower right now to raid another Pack demanding the head of their Alpha for crimes that apparently the whole pack is committing anyway! What madness has gotten into him?&#34; What the hell happened to my life?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t have to do it alone Alpha, Avalon will assist once we have settled our business here and in Karaya... Now come and escort me to wherever these criminals are so I can look to into them and see what sins they have committed. Bayoán I asume you have a record of all of them.&#34; She tells us while taking off her cloak revealing a crisp white long chiton style tunic, showing of her chiseled arms and the same ribbon tattoo that crowns her head that starts at her shoulders and goes down her arms to her wrists where there are gold cuff bracelets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course My Lady... it&#39;s good to know that you still remember how much I love organizing a good execution.&#34; This dude is mental, he&#39;s just smiling at her and she raises an eyebrow and gives him a glare... Ok, I have a feeling that they have history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t tell if she rolls her eyes or not, they are completely black. &#34;Await! We have to get started first.&#34; And she chants something and two large portals open and dozens of Priestesses emerge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to High Priestess Yaya, and give her some maná and go to the unicorns, take them to Avalon at once for treatment, I want to know if they dared extract blood from them. Go and wake Loiza and give her maná as well. Make sure your sisters are washed and dressed according to their station. I will not have Priestesses of Avalon looking like beggars and transfer Life Energy to them as necessary. After, I want two teams, one will sweep this entire territory focused on finding any energy that may come from a unicorn even a dead one. The rest of you will accompany...wait... Where is Braka?&#34; Bayoán signals her. &#34;He is also resting, they both drank Hayan drops.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ryoko go wake General Braka, give him maná too. The rest of you accompany General Braka and Urayoán to Mt. Cemí and look for ANYTHING that feels out of place... my dear, I asume that since you are officially Marked and mated to a Twin Soul who is a strong tracker that you have adapted it?&#34; She asks Freya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes My Lady, I can assist.&#34; She answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good then, you are a rouge no more, you are now Freya Gunn, Mate to Urayoán Mirabal and Delta of the Osupa of Karaya Island, both of you treasure this union, I expect great things from you both... Now, Alpha Kayden, Bayoán, take me to the criminals.&#34; And just like that the smell of rogue on Freya disappears. Urayoán lifts up his mate and she wraps her legs around his waist and they kiss like newlyweds. Ugh! Seeing them like that makes me yearn for my own mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Urayoán composes himself and he and Freya take Marcus to Tatiana. &#34;Don&#39;t worry Kayden, Tatiana will sort your brother in no time, like Sandro she is a strong empath and water obeys her like if she were a Priestess or an elemental witch like Morgana.&#34; Urayoán says. I give Marcus a little nudge to go with them and he just goes. I fucking hope he doesn&#39;t mention our parents or we are screwed and I lead The Lady Moira and Beta Bayoán to the dungeons.</p>
