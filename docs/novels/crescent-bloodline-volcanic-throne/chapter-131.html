                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ayana, Cressy and Hiroto left through portal and we got in the cars. Ura was driving the Mustang with Frey and I the Honda with Nina and Tony as shotgun, it was late and I just wanted to get back fast so Ura and I decided to race back to Itiba... Òrún Road SW is usually empty at this time and I told the patrols to fuck off. We got home in 20 minutes! I can&#39;t wait to see Maco&#39;s face when he sees we have Abuelo&#39;s car!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We drove up to the garages of The Fort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, merci for not letting them put us in the dungeons, I don&#39;t think I could take a stone bed and not have my mischievous mates scent tonight!&#34; The only ones who didn&#39;t get caught were Freya and me, tonight the girls beat the boys 2 - 0! Hiroto had driven stick before but never raced! Ura explained the basics and he got the nack for it QUICK! He was loving how free everyone was. Ayana told me he was loving everything but what she said that he loved to do the most was to sleep with his arms around her and his face in her pale green hair... I have had sex with my mate, but I&#39;ve never SLEPT with him. How pathetic is THAT! Wow... Self pitty Izz? Get a grip! He is MINE and I&#39;ll fucking part the ocean like Yahweh&#39;s prophet Moses to bring him to my side!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem Tony! It&#39;s not your fault your mate has serious issues!&#34; Ura gives me the Heavy Metal symbol and we chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously guys! I admit, you both OBLITERATED me today! How long are you guys going to thrash me?!&#34; I noticed that Ura was getting pissed again. As always with her, she fucks off the message and doesn&#39;t expect consequences! In one ear and out the other!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina...&#34; I say pinching the bridge of my nose before Ura DOES go ape shit and taking a deep breath to still my own patience. &#34;... Why don&#39;t you focus more on how you&#39;re going to own up to this instead worrying about us being angry with you? Haven&#39;t you noticed that we HAVE been angry for a LONG time and we never given you shit for it? Give us a damn break man! When Natalia comes back I want a family reunion! EVERY single Mirabal, no mates! We have become the leaders of this pack and the harmony of our family will affect it! And I&#39;m telling you right now sister one of those things is your relationship with Bayo! So I suggest you do a little soul searching and listen to your mate whom you&#39;re very lucky to have! I can already tell he has it more figured out than you!&#34; She has this solem face. And looks at both Ura and me and nods before looking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just go ok? I&#39;m pretty sure that even at THIS hour Frey wants to take a shower and breastfeed Nyma as much as I want to with my pups. Nina chill ok? You&#39;re still our sister AND a Circle member, THINK! Even with all our anger AT YOU we never forget your our fucking SISTER and we love your cunt ass self! MAYBE somewhere in that artistic brain of yours you can figure out how to reach out to your brother! We ALL lost the chance to make things square with Mami, Dad, hell EVEN TIO! Ok?! They and even Tía have allowed this to go for too long, look at Umbros relationship with Lola! This family is a damn mess and it&#39;s up to US to fix it! Understood?!&#34; Antoine already has his arms giving her comfort for this task she knows she must do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood... I&#39;ll take care of it. I&#39;ll link you tomorrow... Do you want to brainstorm?&#34; Brainstorm? She can actually DO THAT?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to get those other damn tattoos tomorrow, come over and we&#39;ll see what we can come up with for the reunion not the particulars. Ok sister? We can have lunch with a couple of beers, savvy?&#34; I NEED Talia and Maco HERE for this, their the main peace keepers of our family... If in the next Council meeting I don&#39;t have a proposal from the Saint Germaines I will have to summon Augustus Saint Germaine to Court to explain himself! I REALLY don&#39;t want to have to go there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could join the team in India and let them see me rein fire and brimstone upon them, I&#39;m so impatient... Something is coming soon... Something I&#39;ve been waiting for! And then I feel the burn!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SON OF A BITCH! ARE YOU SHITTING ME?!&#34; I gave out with a roar holding the back of my neck. They all come over and Ura lifts my braid up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s another mark!&#34; I&#39;m sooooo Done!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, FINE! Take a picture, let&#39;s see it!&#34; Antoine takes a picture and shows me. What? It&#39;s a dot surrounded by a circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy what is it?&#34; Ura asks. I look around us as if HE would just appear... I&#39;m not a Priestess of HIS service. And didn&#39;t he go missing centuries ago?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;IZZY?!&#34; Frey now asking with more urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the symbol for the Sun! It&#39;s... Ura check and see if there&#39;s a note pad or something in the cars, we can&#39;t say it out loud, we should never say out loud the name of a God we don&#39;t want to summon!&#34; He goes and finds some paper in the Mustang and I swallow deep... It&#39;s got Dad&#39;s handwriting! And I&#39;m forgetting what I&#39;m thinking, I can&#39;t stop looking at it! I light my Priestess Mark yellow, Ura was holding me. Bayo and the other Betas come out with Phoebe, Jolene and Kendra who were chanting a very old incantation to soothe a Priestess. Ura carries me into the inner court yard at the entrance of The Fort and sits me on one of the coral stone benches next to column by one of the various pools that looks like a tropical Roman Bathe... I have to admit, Nina out did herself!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong Izzy?!&#34; Bayo asks me with Shomari and Janaína soothing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayo behind her neck man!&#34; Ura tell him, and I feel Bayo about to say HIS name...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SILENCE BETA!&#34; With my Alpha voice and write down the name on paper next to Dad&#39;s writing... His writing... When was it the time I read something with his hand writing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayo nods at me and I see him link to the rest and they look concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that who&#39;s after Izzy?&#34; Ura asks, but... I don&#39;t feel fear from Apollo, and just saying his name in my head fills me with joy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... He&#39;s near... Somehow... But, I don&#39;t feel fear of him.&#34; Apollo?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, so what riled you up?!&#34; Bayo asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look next to the name... We found Abuelo&#39;s car, it&#39;s just... It all happened at once.&#34; I&#39;m calmed down now and splashed some water on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad... This recipe is from the day before Mt. Cemí. Dad never kept recipes for little things, he left it as a note:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I got you the good stuff mija, have fun changing the oil, and please tell Ura to be careful, your Mom will kill me if he ruins the new couch! Let me know when you want to change the rims!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayo can&#39;t rip his eyes from it... Ura takes a better look at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s just a simple any day note... Nothing and everything special about it. A reminder of how our lives changed SO drastically from one day to another! Nina saw it and gasped and forgotten was the new Mark. I can feel a tear coming out, Ura sits and holds me and Nina comes too and I take her in my arms. We see Bayo open the trunk of The Mustang outside and right there&#39;s the new oil and other stuff he knew we wanted to add on. He threw it far away roaring at it... The only way we can vent... Our enemy not knowing we WILL have satisfaction! He came to us and took us all in his arms. And in turn we were embraced by the sound of the night, the sound of the coquí singing in the darkness reminding us the there too is beauty in the dark. Suania ran down with Nasser and saw us, Bayo handed her the note her eyes filling up with tears as she read it, Nasser went to her but she came to us going in Nina&#39;s arms. Maco walks up with Amelia and a cup cake impaled by 20 candles! Suania gives him the note and he reads it in silence, now with a dark face. He looks at Amelia while she nods and he let&#39;s go of her and he joins our collective hug of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina... Do you understand NOW, what we need?&#34; I&#39;m so full of rage. Pain. Regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crystal...&#34; She says solemnly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izz, we brought you a cake. I thought you might like that since you fucking hate it!&#34; It must have looked nice before the candles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really Maco? A Pinhead cake?&#34; Suania says in disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, I&#39;ll give it to my son! Izzy you&#39;re going to have to suck up your birthday phobia cuz it&#39;s also your nephew&#39;s birthday!&#34; We all look at him and run to his rooms!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morgana is cooing at a hefty newborn with black hair and soft lips, we all collectively inhale his scent already feeling him in our Felial Bond, a new member of our house just at the moment we exhale saying goodbye to the ones who are gone. Freya&#39;s overwhelmed and Ura takes her in his arms as I hold on to my sisters. Maco is holding Amelia and Bayoán coming from behind and putting his arms around Nasser and Tony. Tia Ayiti and Isla come inside with Nyma and the twins and Maco hands Ayiti Dad&#39;s note while taking his daughter and she looked at it for a moment pressing her lips hard she passed it to Isla who handed Deacon over to Tony... she put her hand to her face, they held each other&#39;s hand going to Morgana. This is OUR family! We&#39;re super fucked up! We MUST be ONE UNIT! THIS is how our little pack survives!</p>
