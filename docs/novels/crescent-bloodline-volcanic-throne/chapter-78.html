                <p>Ayiti&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her nerves, Loiza executed her duty exceptionally well, with dignity and grace. I had heard of her little practice run with Alhilal Almuqadas, but this was putting pressure to the kettle. Two large packs and now that the news outlets were up and running again, the scrutiny of the press and therefore the people. Even the fashion magazines Moda Ahora and Divine did a photo shoot of her look and I was thankful for Madame LeBlanche and Master Isaura for making her look like a true Queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet among the new members I had yet to see my own kids. They sealed this pact so they should be here. I go to Director Gloria to ask her what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director, long time no see, are you well?&#34; Yeah let&#39;s get the regular bullshit out of the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chairwolf Ayiti! I am and glad that you are alive, I assure you that the report you asked for is almost done according to your particular specifications, I hope to have in your desk by tomorrow.&#34; Great, since pleasantries are out of the way to the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director I don&#39;t seem to find my offspring anywhere, shouldn&#39;t they have arrived with the new members?&#34; I am anxious to hold them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well since you were not here and a new pack in Senegal composed of mostly ex rogues who decided to unite, has heard of what is happening here wanted to talk about a treaty. The Council has been asking tributes from them to keep the peace, yet the reason they were rogues in the first place was to not to be under the jurisdiction of The Council. And since Natalia, Lola and Umbros were close by and didn&#39;t know if you were alive they decided to check it out, so they asked to be dropped off. It&#39;s actually in the report you will get tomorrow.&#34; That does sound like something they would do. Natalia and Umbros don&#39;t like staying in one place for long. Lola must be pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director, I understand the burden of your post, yet the moment I did appear you should have informed me. Are you in contact with them? Do they know I&#39;m alive?!&#34; I&#39;m gritting my teeth at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are in contact with them, yet they haven&#39;t been informed of your return.&#34; I can&#39;t believe this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director I demand to speak with them, when can I go to HQ for this?&#34; The fucking NERVE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The doors of OPIA HQ are open to you always former Director! You are welcome at any time! However I suggest you read the report first, Natalia is doing very well on her own, I don&#39;t know how such a distraction could help.&#34; Distraction?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will read the report the minute it&#39;s on my desk, I still would like to have a word with them. So expect me at HQ the day after tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Senegal time, I assure you I won&#39;t be a distraction at all. By the way, how large is this pack?&#34; Natalia will give me better information than any report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you wish Ayiti, we will be happy to have you. And the pack is not large, only about 600 members.&#34; 600? A good size to add to our numbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are they wanting to join? Do they know we intend to go to war with The Council?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, and the reason the wish to come is that they are having problems with neighboring packs who don&#39;t recognize their domain since they were rogues, so not only do they want to leave they wish to join us against The Council. Now if you excuse me I have a report to finish.&#34; Yeah you go do that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to where Izzy is taking to ex Alpha Cesar and Bayoán.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Tía this is Cesar, previous Alpha of Oceani Luna, he just informed me of the drop off of Natalia and the others in Dakar. I&#39;m sorry, I know you were looking forward to seeing them. Cesar this is my Tía Ayiti, a member of my council and previous Director of OPIA.&#34; She truly looks regal, it would have been nice for her Kiskeya to see her like this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Un piacere conoscerti, signora, my late father mentioned meeting you many years back!&#34; His father?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Primo benvenuto a Karaya. Are you saying you are Franco&#39;s boy?&#34; He gives a big smile!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes signora! He mentioned that you were a very skilled spy and exceptional diplomat, that&#39;s why I was very excited to work with your daughter in this treaty!&#34; He looked so much like his father!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well first excuse me for calling you boy... Look at you! You are a man and look so much like Franco. I am sorry for his passing, he was in his prime.&#34; He definitely is a replica of Franco, tall with refined features, black hair with deep blue eyes. I had heard he died protecting what was left of his territory, but at least they held it. Oh Franco...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No signora I take no offense! It&#39;s truly an honor to meet you as well as our exquisite Alpha! After seeing her and this paradise, it was very easy to give up my title. And to think we had doubts!&#34; Oh boy, not another star struck wolf!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well she has proven her metal, she is quite capable.&#34; Izzy has made it clear to not hide her mate Mark as well as her tiny bump, but these wolves don&#39;t seem to care!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tía no need for flattery, anyway Cesar you and our new members will be taken to the new city so that everyone can get settled and rest from your journey. My brother will be in touch so as to let you know when everyone will be sorted and training starts for the Warriors. The hospital there is almost complete and only some schools needs a few touches, but like my sister said she wishes to meet with your Kappas to make it feel somewhat like home.&#34; Where is the other Alpha?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Alpha, yet it already feels like home, as long as we have the sea and good weather it does remind everyone of home.&#34; He says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha were is the other previous Alpha of Lune Primière?&#34; And Izzy gives Bayo a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Tía, he is busy at the moment... He like many others has found his mate. So not everyone who arrived will be going to the new city. However since Nina still has work to do over there she will be going tomorrow with Antoine.&#34; Nina is the other Alpha&#39;s mate? That&#39;s going to be very good for this pact and for Nina not to be causing trouble during her sister&#39;s rule... After my dear baby brother thought it would be wise not to allow his Kappa daughter leave Karaya, she made sure to humiliate him at every turn very publicly. Ayato&#39;s choice was his bane. But with her mate she won&#39;t be having her usual escapades and not humiliating Izzy. Great timing indeed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think about this possible treaty with the pack in Senegal? I don&#39;t even think they have a name.&#34; Bayoán asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it will definitely make us stronger. Remember, we already have Senegalese blood in our pack! When the Europeans brought Africans to our shores after almost eliminating the original Tainos and Caribes, we started breeding with both groups strengthening our genetic coding. For example look at General Braka... the Reyes family date their ancestry back to the Wolof people, they are known for their strength and height, yet those brought here were humans and yet when we mated with them the wolves that came from those matings became some of our most powerful Warriors. This pack ARE wolves, so not only do they carry their strong human genetic coding but the breed of the African Golden Wolf! Natalia knows these attributes, I now my daughter well enough to know that she decided to take on this mission to add these powerful wolves into the fold. It&#39;s a great Blessing from the Goddess!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My daughter may talk a lot of smack but information and how to use it is her strongest trait. Plus she ALWAYS has MANY correct words to give whomever she&#39;s negotiating that they want to hear. The girl is no Truth Seer like Umbros, she uses her natural sense to listen to heartbeat, her eyes are sharper than blades and her nose can smell the slightest chemical imbalance of someone&#39;s sweat. This is the trait she shares with Ura, although I must admit, his is better... He just doesn&#39;t have her mouth!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s pray her mission results as fruitful as her success in France and Sardinia. I was hoping to see them as well Tía, yet your right. I will be looking forward on reports of their progress.&#34; Loiza smiles, I am sure she is thinking about the possibilities for the future of our people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loiza POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tía&#39;s perspective made me excited! If more packs join I see a bright future for our people. Just now I see A LOT of people finding their mates among the new arrivals and I am thanking the Goddesses for Nina finding her mate! It&#39;s going to make everything less complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see Yahir in the distance whispering in the ear of a beautiful long chestnut haired girl, he found his mate! It&#39;s bittersweet, yet it&#39;s for the best, my focus right now must remain on my people and my babies. I see him come over with his mate and Samira joins them with what seems is her own true mate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha this is Lucía my mate! And Samira found her true mate as well!&#34; I hug them all and congratulate them. &#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you?! We should never loose hope! I personally welcome you both to your new home and wish you all great happiness and the Blessings from the Goddesses.&#34; Now that we have a confirmation that Gaia is watching over us as well, Nina has placed Master Manuel in charge of the building of shrines in her honor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Alpha, this is Louis! I can&#39;t believe I found him!&#34; Samira&#39;s eyes are brimming looking at her mate who is as tall and built as Bayoán with very light blonde hair and ice blue eyes, he&#39;s a Beta. Damn Samira sure has an affinity for them! To be fair so did I...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am very happy for all of you! Now Louis, Samira has suffered great loss I hope that you help her bring her laughter back to life!&#34; And he better treat that pup with love! But soon am comforted by his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enchanté mighty Alpha! I am already working on my lovely Samira&#39;s smile and got the bonus of having our first son almost here! I had been searching for her but never thought she would be in hiding, I am glad to finally get to hold her!&#34; And I look at Yahir and he looks so happy for his sister. The strong Osupa Bond was was adapting well and Louis was serving to Samira&#39;s needs and he looks enchanted by her copper skin, long shinning black hair and turquoise eyes like those of her siblings, and already had his hand on her giant belly, which she wasn&#39;t slapping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Samira, where&#39;s Fatima? I talked with Chef Domingo and he has various apprentices yet I told him of her talent and would be interested in taking her under his wing.&#34; She looked around and called for her, she was helping serve food for new members. And she came over. I told her my plan and her face lit up!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean I get to come here to learn?&#34; She asks with her sweet voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not just learn her querida, you get to live here! There&#39;s an entire wing were the chefs and their students live, you will learn not only local cuisine, but how to prepare food from all over the world Nasser is already here and you can come and go as you please... Except when you are in learning mode.&#34; She looks as Samira and Samira gives her a look that says it&#39;s up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When can I move?!&#34; Well her shyness is dissipating!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can move right away if you want! Most are about your age and I am sure you will make new friends!&#34; After being in caves for over a year, studying new things and making friends should be a nice distraction. Plus the kitchens are on the second floor (the main entrance of The Fort is on the third) they are huge and have big open oak windows that overlook the sea and because of the breeze it never smells of lingering food, which helps keep a fresh palette and scent to make the dishes to perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I bring my stuff tomorrow?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will be expecting you tomorrow then honey, I will make sure you have a bedroom waiting for you with fresh linens and clean towels for your bathroom!&#34; Her eyes become wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get my very own room?!&#34; I chuckle at this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With all the trimmings!&#34; She looks at Samira and Yahir and their new mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Expect me tomorrow! The apartment is going to be crowded and I will love to learn to make new stuff! So I&#39;ll be here!&#34; With Samira having support from her mate I&#39;m sure it will take that burden from the girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow it is!&#34;</p>
