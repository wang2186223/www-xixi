                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We received those who were extracted from The Council &#34;safe house&#34;. I saw the videos and there is nothing safe about it. They were in underground tunnels were already some had been dismembered completely, their pieces sold off to the Black Market. Shomari, Hashaan and the others searched for their families. One of Shomari&#39;s sisters wasn&#39;t there, neither was Hashaan&#39;s mother or father, but all 22 of his siblings were with his father&#39;s third wife. Not all were albinos, but most were, 387 of them to be exact and others had conditions like Vitiligo, which made people around those parts believe it magical to eat this meat. In total there were 502. They were really the last bit of evidence we needed. Phoebe, Yaya and Morgana verified every story and except for the dummy who was supposed to be watching them, they all checked out. They begged for sanctuary which I granted. Hashaan and Shomari, now with all that fake black dye off his hair and looking very nice with long dreads and both in white linens were front and center to accept their sanctuary and be added to our people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wore pale green that diffused to pale yellow. It was a criss cross dress with long open sleeves, it had a white corset as a type of belt which also framed my torso and raised my cleavage, I wore the same cold leaf earrings, wolf arm band and The Guanín. The Queen&#39;s Braid again adorned with yellow pearls, seriously, Isaura needs to come up with something else! This is a pain on my hair, I just want to cut it off! The press already had their sources on what would happen tomorrow, so they wanted to broadcast my every public word to everyone on the island. I just keep feeling weaker, how am I going to do this? The greeting for the Tanzania group also had everyone very interested, albinism is a rare mutation in our particular breed so the people were already in the temples making offerings and prayers for matings hoping to be mated to one, these matings ensure the albinism be passed down to the children since the other person in the mating also carries that recessive trait in their gene pool as to maintain that valuable mutation... At least to US it is! Camouflage and espionage is crucial to our way of life, so those who already have this trait or close to it, like Joey and her twin sister Samantha. Their hair color is close to white but their eyes are indeed dark. Their family carry their genes all the way to the Klan af Sølvmånen (Clan of the Silver Moon), their old Alpha Odin came up with this bullshit story of... Well many of you know this tale. Anyways their specific breed carried all the way down from them. Spain had granted benefits to those who converted to their religion, we met them when we were still looking for a home and they used their own sea prowess to help and join with us. They are of a very powerful family in Karaya with the their original name Spøgelser af Fuldmånen, eventually it got cut to Spogel but everyone on this island know their legacy. Their power came from that mutation that serves as perfect camouflage for snow weather and their original viking spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if we can train them for the harshness of the winter this could definitely cut some of our workload to actually enjoy the extra perks of this job.&#34; Enid has maintained the strength of her family and place in the tribe and their large estate near the village of Mabó north east of Itiba City in the mountains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is more of a help for vacation than competition Alpha! We would definitely enjoy training them and actually remember that we are from the TROPICS! Get to enjoy some summer sometimes! My skin is so sensitive to HOME now that I need REST AND HAVE A TAICARAYA drip Alpha! Like, no offense, but the Vampire juice?! We would be happy to train them but they must know we are not joking Loiza, you KNOW of our training! Tu madre knew, Diosa la bendiga, that more with a similar breed or mutation was needed mija, we&#39;ve been doing this since the before we were Osupa! We have made sure to keep the breed strong for the needs of the pack. There is nothing wrong with their mutation, let US train them Alpha.&#34; Enid, the matriarch for The Spogel Family, was making the case to add them for The White Out tactics force. I was actually thinking about it, I mentioned it to Shomari who didn&#39;t see his mutation as powerful. Enid hosted them at their estate and The Spogels showed them what their family did for the pack. Shomari was very impressed and they came to an agreement to receive the training, they were less excited when they heard they would start in Siberia... This would help those who have been called horrible things to understand that who they were was actually very special and The Spogel Family have been carrying this weight for the pack for very long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I guess we will see what happens after tomorrow. Today we have seen how The great Werewolf High Council values us, we are just pieces to be sold off to hide their lack of true value, their fineries just fake freedoms they bestow only on the elites, the rest of the packs under their jurisdiction are just places of lowly transactions. After tomorrow we will take that veil off the eyes of every warewolf on the planet. After tomorrow no one can feign ignorance. After tomorrow we really get to see our enemy in the face and tell the &#39;WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WE KNOW WHERE TO ALWAYS FIND YOU! Today we welcome our new brothers and sisters, they come from many countries which make up The African Continent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This brings great sadness for us as well. A large part of our words, customs and traditions, music and food, comes from this continent. Some of our Elders speak of it when their Elders used to speak of it and say finding it like something that must have happened to someone else but never to The Osupa, yet it did. We must continue to teach the old ways to not forget ourselves, we must continue to tell our story as well as the one we live now. For this shall be the first time we have ever declared war on The Warewolf High Council, I hope it&#39;s the last time we do too, for all of our sakes.&#34;</p>

                <p>We drove into the pack house garage, while Moira and her Priestesses were standing by for my corpse or of a tied up insane wolf!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We opened the back of our trucks letting out every single dead asshole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;250 My Lady, give or take! Happy? Avis, Gabriel bring Keaton and Lydia!&#34; It was raining really hard. Caliburn and I are reaching an understanding. He sees he can&#39;t do shit to me and he can&#39;t lie either. He still really wants blood and just told me my loving parents only were so if Marcus and I were ok with their bullshit! They had a little plan to have everyone killed but they had to take them out of the compound, but I had eyes on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha!&#34; Avis and Gabriel came with them... Marcus and everyone came out to look. I put Keaton and Lydia at one of the blocks where I took those other heads, two more wouldn&#39;t make a difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ordered Marcus to put her first, as I am now, I want Keaton to feel pain, I can&#39;t tell if she does anymore, but I KNOW he is still willing to do anything for her. So to see her go first will be feeding of my anger at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden, son what are you doing?! Have you gone mad? Everyone look! My sons have gone insane!&#34; The Lady Moira stepped in front of her and looked her up and down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still can&#39;t believe that you were ever a Priestess.&#34; She tells her with her empty eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Marcus and I prepare to execute our mother, the Lady Moira just chants...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lydia, Lydia, gold and fair,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What bloody stains have you in your hair?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For all the Blessings on you such</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hath never a need for much</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a Priestess yearns for freedom</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For you it&#39;s now become an alien term</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Freedom in the next life is something</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You definitely did not earn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did many fakeries with your poses</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Welcome to the Club of the Cursed Roses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks at me and nods and swing the sword. Keaton tries to lounge at me and got loose from Avis he starts shifting to attack me but I swung Caliburn at his throat and just like that I was retching my breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I throw the fucking sword to the floor. &#34;I have done EVERYTHING that has been asked of me to get her back! Am I really cursed like Marius?! Have I lost my mate?!&#34; The Lady Moira looks at me like I have lost my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about boy? Cursed like Marius? Arcana, put those two in dry ice! Alpha Kayden is going to present them to the gathering tomorrow!&#34; Wait what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marius told me you took his mate away from him! Gathering?!&#34; I need someone who knows how to handle her better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he? Did he also say how he was Blessed with a beautiful Priestess and started wanting to give her the finer things so started buying and selling people and she found out after a successful Heat?&#34; She looks as my parents heads are being cleaned up and put in the ice. &#34;Her mating to Marius was indeed cut off by the Goddess and sadly because of his actions, the child was deemed the child of abomination and discharged from her body. She, of course got a second chance mate who are reserved for the truly righteous.&#34; She hands me an invitation from... &#39;The Alpha Loiza of The Osupa and Cacique of Karaya Island&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go inside put it on the counter and dry my hands with a towel and pass it to Marcus. I take a knife and open it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;The Osupa people want to invite you to a Declaration of War.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their Alpha Loiza of the Mirabal Dynasty, Cacique of The Osupa and High Priestess of Avalon, wants to show you everything you need to know about the goings on what they don&#39;t want you to know, cocktail to formal wear attire recommended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Location: THWC Main Office in London, be no later than 2:00 p.m. London time.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is for TOMORROW!&#34; She hands me Caliburn again and puts out her hand. What does she want?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to see the Mark Alpha, I need to see it with my own eyes to have the power to hand it over to your custody... and it&#39;s 2:00 p.m. London time, so technically time is against you.&#34; I show her the Mark that I was told to show her. &#34;We didn&#39;t curse Marius, that he did himself, Loiza hasn&#39;t been taken from you has she?&#34; I shake my head slowly. &#34;What you did is not trusting the one you love with the truth, you will see her tomorrow, so dress nice Alpha Kayden of the Blood Moon Pack, The Goddesses&#39;s Executioner and Master of Caliburn. Now go and get ready, and remember this isn&#39;t a ball Cinderella!&#34;</p>
