                <p>Antoine&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what I had remember from her birthday, Izzy was pissed at how unorganized and unprepared everyone was in the past meeting. I personally never had these types of meetings at all! Louis and I would take all of our actions into consideration but at the end of the day the final say was mine alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next order of business... Salas Na Gealaí Clan. Is everything ready for that extraction?&#34; She&#39;s doing well, she&#39;s managing this pack more like a Board of Directors than a regular Alpha. A very practical approach to ruling, I&#39;ve noticed that she&#39;s more confident in her decisions and Kayden and Orocobix have been guiding her more and helping her see the different choices she can make, she still asks me somethings but with Kayden here she listens to his view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Cacique, they were double checked by Avalon Priestesses at the Lady Moira&#39;s command but everything is as it was before and they also have a quite large contribution to the pack, either way we can cause a blackout over all of Europe and the humans&#39; PTSD will act up and they will panic as usual and we could do the same trick as India.&#34; Shomari passes around the report from Ireland, as this pack will be contributing assets and it&#39;s not top secret we all get a copy and they have a large trade in textiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t agree with that plan Beta Shomari, the point of getting these companies up and running again is not only to make money but to utilize their global power. We have to give the humans some breathing room to calm down to jump start the world economy again, it&#39;s going to already take quite some time but if we continue to use fear tactics it will also affect OUR business. The Council may want to put a mole inside Karaya, but we all know they have retreated and have their tails between their legs, they don&#39;t have the manpower to attack anyone right now. This doesn&#39;t have to be a super complicated extraction, all we really have to do is to take all measures for everyone&#39;s safety and just bring them with the ships. Besides, we have as many planes we could want right now and the airport isn&#39;t big enough for more.&#34; Janaína lays out a very good point. Salas Na was being bombarded with attacks but after we decimated The Council the attacks stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However they&#39;re too weak and they still have to deal with more bullshit out of North Ireland since they live so close to the border. Also their pack is barely 1,200 and have been mortal enemies with The Moon&#39;s Children pack who are over 3,000 strong for over a century. Council or not, looks like their Alpha Saoirse O&#39;Neill decided to throw in the towel. I can only imagine the things going through her head right now, I was in her same situation. We had two packs that were relentless enemies to the east, it gets tiring after disputes hit the century mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Izzy is verifying their numbers, their location and all the things I know she takes into account she&#39;s slightly nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree with your observations Beta, we can&#39;t squeeze the humans to a point were OUR OWN agenda will be affected and we definitely don&#39;t need anymore planes, the ones we have need updates and refurbishing, some are being stripped down to the bones and are getting every security system in place.&#34; She keeps reading some details. In the time I have gotten to know Izz and how The Osupa handle their affairs I have come to have many epiphanies. They might complain about some things about themselves yet had they grown up in another pack they really wouldn&#39;t care, like this meeting! And yet it really makes sense to have these regularly, especially in such a large pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayoán gave me a little snippet of what happened last time and how he even was embarrassed not just of being chastised by  his little sister, but the whole ordeal. I&#39;ve been to wolf gatherings, balls and meetings with other packs with my Father since before I could shift and they were ALL shit shows and shouting matches! The fact that in her FIRST meeting Loiza showed that she would not tolerate that behavior not giving a shit if many of it is already considered standard, made everyone get in line. I probably would have started shouting too! But the fact that Ayato was trying to contain it was enough to show that to some that behavior was being viewed by themselves as beneath them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day after that meeting and everyone was taking in the pack working in harmony for it&#39;s revenge Braka, Gloria and Ayiti were talking about how they even felt a bit of fear and shame over how it was conducted. Nina and I were waiting to talk with Izzy about the reunion and Nina scoffed when she heard them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I don&#39;t understand is how YOU are all surprised! Izzy is a Priestess of Avalon! Go ahead and ask Lady Yaya if the Lady Moira would have tolerated whatever bullshit you guys did yesterday. You guys wanted a temporary Alpha but you forget that she&#39;s lived longer in Avalon than here and those bitches don&#39;t fool around, so my sister putting the smack down shouldn&#39;t have surprised any of you. I recommend that whatever bad habits you have to kill them at once and make damn sure to be prepared and conduct yourselves like the professionals you&#39;re supposed to be!&#34; I remember being so proud of her at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fierce chèri may be a mess sometimes but when it comes to her work she&#39;s VERY serious. Before starting any project she itemizes EVERYTHING and double checks all of her blueprints, the geology on where the construction will take place and only works with engineers and artists she trusts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel how tense the OG Osupa are except for Víctor, he wasn&#39;t here last time but he got the report, and from what I heard he was furious and Urayoán told me on Izzy&#39;s birthday that it was Víctor who would serve as team leader every time they had a mission together and praised how meticulous he was and how before starting he would present his plan and ask everyone if they saw any flaws. He didn&#39;t know he would be pack Beta and there&#39;s no room for mistakes in the field... Knowing how much of an asset he would be in that position, Izzy swallowed her pride and asked him for his expertise. When I found out about the WHOLE story I became embarrassed again because I don&#39;t think I would have put an ex lover who I was angry at in such a place of power in the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cacique if I may?&#34; Admiral Casimar interjects. Izzy gazes at him with a pleasant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Admiral, do you have any suggestions?&#34; He hands her a report and after looking it over she passes it to Víctor and he reads it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you can see from the report, the ships we have are in perfect condition but if we are going to go through with the different plans for the pack we will need more. We can do a convert mission to the nearest naval base and take a few! My crew can be either ported or flown there and we can acquire what we need, we would just need cover.&#34; Izzy looks at Víctor as he passes the report to Gloria. He looks at Izzy and nods, he agrees with Casimar&#39;s plan but doesn&#39;t look his way. She is absolutely relaxed as she looks at Kayden and he smiles at her nodding agreeing with the plan. Kayden KNOWS about the history of both men and his mate but he really doesn&#39;t give a fuck, he told me last night that it did bug him at first but that it was Víctor who relaxed his mind. Víctor and Casimar are another matter entirely. They are working together, and Víctor doesn&#39;t seem to be bothered, he just isn&#39;t engaging with Casimar and vise versa. It&#39;s absurdly funny and if it were me I probably would die of awkwardness, Izzy however isn&#39;t even flinching and is acting absolutely aloof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director Gloria, Councilwolf Ayiti, what say you to the Admiral&#39;s plan?&#34; Both women start writing down somethings and verify their notes and they&#39;re clearly linking with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s definitely posible! We will need some time to prepare, but its potential for success are very high! I will put a team together and we will fly you over, if we are going to hijack some ships we will need enough sailors to navigate at least three or four, should that be enough Admiral?&#34; Gloria asks and Casimar nods and agrees with the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright! What about the Wives of the Gods Coven? Are they in imminent danger that they need an emergency extraction or can they wait until the new ships are secure?&#34; Izz looks over to Phoebe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Queen, Maddame LaCroix and her people are holding, but they do need a faster extraction and the team has to be well versed in witches magic. I suggest that while OPIA prepares a team to bring the Irish and give them a designated time, Admiral Casimar can make a fast pickup since they are less than a thousand and it&#39;s not so very far. Morgana, Lady Yaya and myself have interrogated them thoroughly.&#34; Izz nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Admiral, is that acceptable for you?&#34; Izzy asks and he nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we can definitely do that, where would be the rendezvous point My Lady?&#34; He&#39;s taking down notes and I notice him writing down latitude and longitude points... I know nothing about navigation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll have you head out as soon as we&#39;ve prepared the team who&#39;ll escort you, we want to assure that every witch has been checked again the minute they enter your ship, so Morgana has an original spell she&#39;s been working on for a while and it will alert of deception and melt away glamour once a threshold has been crossed. Endora had a suggestion and now it finally works to perfection! We intend for it to be cast on every plane, boat, vehicle and Karaya itself as well as every safehouse we have. But prep your crew, it shouldn&#39;t be more than a few days Admiral.&#34; He knows their location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine, it will give me more time to coordinate the safest rendezvous, also I would like the cloaking system to be amplified, The Gulf has several oil rigs and some have newer equipment that have the potential of tracing us, that&#39;s without mentioning the upgrades OPIA reported in Coast Guard boats. Cacique we could also do with some upgrades for speed.&#34; Gloria writes it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s absolutely fine Admiral, I&#39;ll have techs to arrange it immediately. Does anybody have anything else to add to this mission?&#34; Izzy asks while writing down her own notes and calculations asking Casimar for the locations he thinks are best and he passes her his notes and she copies them down and hands him back his notepad with a smile and he smiles back... You can really see his yearning and immediately his resignation. Poor guy, I look at Kayden who&#39;s sitting at the right side of Izz and I can tell he saw that but he looks just as relaxed as her. No mated wolf, especially an Alpha, would be too keen on having their mate gawked at but he&#39;s calm, he was however looking straight at Casimar where their gazes met and the Admiral had to lower his eyes in submission. Kayden kept gazing at Casimar as a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, now to the next item... Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to take over the world?&#34; Our Alpha asks with brimming smile...</p>
