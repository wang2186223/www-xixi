                <p>Bayoán&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janaína arrived early, she&#39;s almost as tall as Izzy, yet with a stronger, bulkier build. She has dark ebony skin, hair in long graceful cornrows, eyes the color of honey, I can imagine the unmated males all over her. As we tested her skills we also found out she can speak multiple languages and in her training so far has shown to be strong, agile and a competent fighter, both in human and wolf form...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Janaína why did Federico name your brother his Beta when you are clearly much more competent and a freaking Truth Seer? That alone is very valuable to our pack.&#34; Víctor asked her. Since he met her on their way here the question has vexed him. I already told him that it was likely because of her gender, but Víctor has always thought those as ridiculous excuses, for him if a person is more competent he preferred them as partners in any mission regardless of gender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him with bitterness... &#34;Beta, I can see that my new pack thrives because you choose the best. It&#39;s not the same everywhere, I am female, I was barely allowed to even be a Warrior. I was to be a good little mate to some idiot and have strong babies. Because of my fighting skills, I was allowed to at least be a Warrior and only a sentinel at that.&#34; Víctor looked at me shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With that mindset I have a feeling more packs are going through difficult times, even we are not inoccent of this stupidity... Wasting their best resources because of petty bullshit! No wonder so many are falling like flies.&#34; I could feel his anger and frustration through our Beta Bond and I basically told him I told you so in our mind. Janaína seemed to share in his anger but she was poised and measured in her words. She was a true Osupa Beta indeed showing this much control of her rage, I liked her right away. Her and Shomari were already questioned by Morgana and Phoebe and she had already expressed her anger towards her old Alpha and The Elders of her pack towards their mindset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shomari arrived on schedule, he was even faster in his calculations outside of a dungeon cell and with his family safe. He had been receiving training with the Spogel family. Yet that time in training showed in the new bulk of his body, the Spogel family also gave a report on his training and according to them he is a strong asset to the pack whether in the field or as a Beta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;...in the months Shomari Diop has been training for White Out espionage and in the field, he has shown impressive adaptation to the methods he has been taught. His speed has increased by 94% in regular terrain, 87% in powder snow, 79% in sleek snow and 69% on ice. His strength, which was already impressive, has improved by 97% and his Beta calculations are exceptional, functioning at easily a 178% capacity, well above any Beta we have trained. It&#39;s of my opinion that the candidate will not disappoint our pack, our Great Cacique or his comrades if accepted as Beta and I strongly recommend his admission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Respectfully,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enid Spogel Ramirez&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They really don&#39;t mess around, they didn&#39;t achieve their standing and power in the pack for nothing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Shomari, Enid&#39;s report speaks highly of your fast adaptation to their rigorous training... Are you ready to spend more time in warmer weather?&#34; I asked him as Víctor just smiled at Enid&#39;s report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know? It&#39;s funny because even though it&#39;s hard as Hades, they have so many techniques that make you adapt very fast to their training. My sister and two of my cousins in fact love being in the cold, many of the albinos that we brought are thriving and love their new found strength and respect from the pack! And so many have found their mates with much enthusiasm... In Tanzania it was a curse to be mated to one of us, here everyone who&#39;s found their mates have not only not been rejected, but have found their true soulmates. I got used to the cold, but I had enough of it when I was growing up in London, so yeah I would love not having to deal with it so much.&#34; Víctor started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dude you only were in training with the Spogels for a short time, their training is INTENSE! Enid is being very generous in this report, for them anything under a 230% rating is insufficient! But still you impressed Enid and their family usually doesn&#39;t have Betas, they are an Epsilon legacy family, so you&#39;re going to have to impress OUR testing for the calculations, right now we really only need one Beta, but if you impress US like you have Enid we will definitely consider adding you. The pack will keep growing and not having to look for another Beta for a while will help with the work we have ahead. Got it?&#34; Shomari gave a sly smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well game on Beta Víctor, bring on your testing!&#34; And we tested him just as hard as we did with Janaína... Calculus, trigonometry, advanced strategy, physics, changing combative styles and improvised moves, sharpshooting with different wind factors and then we shifted and did it all over in our wolf form. He and his snow white wolf Omen matched everything we threw at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both him and Janaína were just as impressive as we had hoped. Víctor and I agreed that BOTH were exactly what we needed for our pack... We even wanted to do more training the four of us once they are named to increase our synchronicity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we we&#39;re satisfied with what we were going to do we linked Izzy before telling them that we indeed wanted them both. She came with Isla and the pups and started studying the report while I took my nephew in my arms so she could focus more and check out the recordings of especially their improvising in combat. Morgana will go into labor very soon and I have been practicing here and there with the pups to get a feel for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ura and Freya are now overdue and she&#39;s stressing, while Ura is absorbing her stress, each day they&#39;re adjusting more to the Twin Soul Bond, but Freya&#39;s personality is much more forward and stronger than Ura&#39;s. We thought that they would already be similar, but we were very wrong... But since Ura is naturally very laid back he is little by little projecting his own personality on her and the moment she starts stressing he plays with her hair or rubs her back and she settles down very quickly. Daniella and Estefanía are making record of it for a future Twin Soul matings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right, they&#39;re both very impressive! Can you imagine if they would have been born here?!&#34; She says to anyone listening. I go to Víctor with Deacon so he can hold him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get ready compadre, you are going to have your leave and you&#39;ll be carrying one of these soon!&#34; He gives Izzy a questioning look and she just smiles and nods to him with a wink to take the pup. He takes him nervously while Izzy and Isla can&#39;t help but give out a laugh at his face. I see Izzy link someone before going back to the report and Isla comes to me and hands me Jade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree with you guys... Best to name them both and avoid having to deal with looking for another one in a while and I really like the idea of all of you training together. I&#39;m so glad you agreed to take this office, it can hold four more desks easily and still be comfortable, I will order two more be added with the equipment necessary. Link them over so I can name them so they can start ASAP before Víctor goes on leave---&#34; And just before she finishes the sentence...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s too adorable!&#34; The Lady Magdalena comes in the office with shinning eyes looking at her mate holding Deacon. She gives Izzy a smiling look as she goes to her mate and Izzy winks back at her sister Priestess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought maybe a little inspiration would help with you guys with a successful heat! Please My Lady, don&#39;t let your ovaries explode at the sight!&#34; Víctor was about to hand his mate the pup when she refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have taken care of pups before Mi Amor, I am enjoying the sight of THIS! And I don&#39;t know Alpha, my ovaries amongst other things are feeling like they&#39;re about to explode at this picture! Thank you for calling me over, Blessed Be!&#34; She gave Víctor little kisses on his cheek turning him into a puppy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does it feel cariño?&#34; She asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still don&#39;t know, but I am very interested in that part you mentioned about parts of you exploding... We will start on that as soon as I get off today! And it&#39;s going to be a rough week but once I am off you are MINE princesa!&#34; He says while nibbling at her Mark making her giggle and Deacon starts laughing and his sister joins him when she hears him. Making Magdalena extend her arms towards Jade who in turn goes to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I already know that Morgana and I are having just one and she&#39;s not wanted to know the gender, but I already know it&#39;s a boy and everything is ready for our pup and Ura&#39;s to join the twins in the nursery when they are old enough, Mónica is going to have her hands full. But I can feel the nervousness mixed with excitement coming from Víctor. The other day Izzy and a few of us went to The Southern Temple with offerings so that they and everyone about to have their Heat have a successful one. Even in a healthy mated couple a heat doesn&#39;t guarantee offspring, especially on the first one, so this little exercise that Izzy did of linking the Lady Magdalena is an old wives tale of our people to help along with the successful fertilization of the egg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright guys, you&#39;ll have your fun soon enough and I will be telling Moira to send Kendra and Jolene over to take over your duties in the Shrine while you are on leave My Lady. According to Ryoko they are ready to take their duties as Handmaids to assist you, so with that and adding both Janaína and Shomari should give you both the peace of mind to forget about everything and focus on each other. I will check on the girls to make sure that they&#39;re not destroying your garden My Lady, I don&#39;t remember it ever looking as good as it does now!&#34; She goes and takes Jade from Magdalena and Isla goes for Deacon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can second that! I don&#39;t know what special magic you have My Lady, but after living here for so many years it&#39;s a joy to take my prayers to the Goddesses and meditate. Never have I seen so many species of butterflies and beautiful birds you almost never see so close to the coast, usually we would enjoy that more when we go for runs in the forests!&#34; Magdalena&#39;s blush and Víctor&#39;s proud look towards his mate gives me hope that they will achieve what they wish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayo, link the candidates so that I can name them and you guys can get them up to speed on where we&#39;re at. I want a report on my desk tomorrow on the extractions taking place and the status on the other three that asked for sanctuary. I also want to give the alternative to packs that wish to stay in their territory... We can offer to send experts to train their Warriors like we did with Blood Moon, without the whole spy in their mists trick. We would need official treaties and declarations of them entering the jurisdiction of Avalon... You will extend this to Blood Moon as well. Whatever Kayden and his pack decide to do when we extended the invitations to openly join, I would prefer that they are as strong as possible. I hear Jason is doing good progress...&#34; It&#39;s more a question than a statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s doing better than just good progress Izz, he&#39;s adapting much faster than expected, when he&#39;s not flirting with every unmated female on sight! By the Goddess, he was even making out with Safiro last week! And she wasn&#39;t using her seduction magic this time! The boy sure likes the Mermaids and they really like him!&#34; Víctor reports to which Izzy just laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m more worried about Safiro, I have to talk to Queen Pasha about her, I don&#39;t mind her enjoying her time with the unmated boys or girls of her choosing as long as she doesn&#39;t use enchantments. I already told her Majesty that more likely than not the boys and girls will gladly make out with them without the need for magic! Either way I would like to talk with him, so dismiss his training for tomorrow and send him over with the report. Ok?&#34; She says smiling at her son. &#34;Are you going to be kissing Mermaids when you say your just going to the beach to surf mijo?!&#34; He laughs as he grabs her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem... So I&#39;ll link you when Janaína and Shomari are here, we&#39;ll make them do the reports so that they can get acquainted with how we do them. I&#39;ll inform Jason to be in your office after lunch, oh and The Commerce Committee wants to know when we&#39;re reopening the Red Light District and are asking for permits for Atabex City. Ayana and Phoebe have been asking as well to add to the contract with the fae folk, they are really looking forward to it.&#34; I just blurt that last part, that part of the city has been closed since before The Incident... I used to have some good times there, and not just sex, usually unmated pack members enjoy those, but there are also burlesque and exotic shows, the best lingerie shops and sex shops for toys and other fun stuff. I got Morgana my favorite set on her there when we Marked and mated, everything is usually one of a kind, the color of the fire in her untamed orange hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Goddesses I had forgotten! I love Maddame VonNoir&#39;s Burlesque and Vedettes Dulce&#39;s and Chacha&#39;s shows... I never got to see the new show that Kike and his mate Santiago were doing with the silks in the air! Yeah, make sure everything is up to code and ask Ayana and Pheobe what do the interested fae have in mind, I am indeed curious about that, they usually have an ample imagination for the most exotic and interesting proposals. Anyway I&#39;m going to feed these two, I&#39;ll be down once the new Betas are here and have Miguelina ready so that they can choose which apartments they wish as their rank dictates and that they can occupy as soon as they wish.&#34; And with that her and Isla leave to deal with the twins.</p>
