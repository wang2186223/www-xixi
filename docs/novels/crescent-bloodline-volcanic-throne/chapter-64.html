                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t feel anything... No love, no hate, no fear, no sympathy, it&#39;s like I am just an empty shell. When Morgana put the block up while I was securing Kayden to the tree all anger or passion towards him faded away, there were still traces of everything we just did... a memory of joy, bliss and pleasure. When I took one last look at his beautiful face I couldn&#39;t help but kiss him one last time and cut a lock of his hair, my feelings for him were just neutral and yet a part of me compelled me to do that. I took my clothes in my mouth and shifted to run faster... Aryn was not happy at all, not with me, not with Kayden, not even with Deacon and I wasn&#39;t in a negotiating mood so I compelled her to run as fast as possible to the tent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was evacuating to the planes and many Blood Moon pack members saw the commotion and wanted to come with us... mostly Omegas. The rest that wanted to raise the alarm were enchanted by the Priestesses to forget what they saw and go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I went to my personal tent with the things I had brought in advance from the pack house, my feelings were still off, yet I didn&#39;t want to leave Kayden, I was so confused. I had a memory of immense fondness towards him, when I saw in his memories I understood why he was so ignorant of many things. His parents kept both him and Marcus from important information, especially about The Council, but because Marcus is a Beta his natural curiosity and hunger for knowledge gave him an edge. Yet I also saw the immense potential Kayden has to be an exceptional leader and what a ferocious Warrior he is and despite of his faults he has particular favor from the Goddess. As to why, I didn&#39;t have enough time to see. I am still processing his memories, yet the goal of finding betrayal was met. His mother sold us out, his father was complicit and he KNEW, that&#39;s the information that I was to find. I am still working out the timeline of when he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when I was in the tent I start picking up my books... The Prince and The Art of War with my notes should help him be a better leader, I take off my cloak and cut a lock of my own hair putting it inside one of them, then I wrap the books in the cloak we mated on... it means nothing to me right NOW, I hope he finds it and fulfills his destiny. I can&#39;t find the gibberish book and I asume Bayoán took it, but my small note pad was with the other books so I put it in my bag...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cacique we must go!&#34; Yaya comes for me and we leave not looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once in the plane I have a chance to ask Morgana what&#39;s happening with my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy, it takes time to get used to it. But your emotions will return in a few days, it&#39;s just that your brain is adjusting to who it&#39;s supposed to take effect on blocking. When it determines it&#39;s the one who marked you, the block will release your emotions as before but not let the ones from him enter your mind. But you have to understand something Izz, the mate Bond, especially between Alphas, is very strong. You still will get some emotions and thoughts from him, but of every single blocking spell, this is the strongest.&#34; I took in the information, I didn&#39;t really care for anything right now so I stoped caring for the explanation but I understood. I felt as light as a feather and for a while I hoped my emotions would never come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listened to the exited voices around me while I looked out the window to the darkness of the night and suddenly I had a flash of his green jade eyes glowing even greener. I cleared my mind and I pushed them out, and suddenly I felt so tired and before I know it I am waking up at the bumping of the the plane landing. The first thought was of him, I know Marcus found him and my spell is still holding. It should hold for a week, but somehow I know it won&#39;t hold for that long. I look out the window and the sunshine looks splendid but I see that there are still debris around the airport and I feel nothing. I remember the woman from The Catacombs and I know that there is a purpose I have to meet... but I don&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some vehicles were working but it will take time to mobilize the people back to their homes and Avalon was working overtime to get shelter for the new additions, every Truth Seer was interrogating everyone new since we were in the air. The Priestesses and technicians had achieved a lot from yesterday to now but again I just don&#39;t really care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayoán comes to me with Morgana, Yaya, Gloria and Braka with his mate... Helena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy, Morgana explained to me how the block works and I am reliving you of your duties until you are fully back with us, ok?&#34; He says and I feel through the link he is a bit afraid and sad for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Agreed, I could turn this island to ashes right now and just not care. Even I can recognize I am not fit to rule right now. Just take me to The Fort and put a Prime Priestess to guard me just in case. I trust you can handle a few days of ruling yourself and I expect that the military will assist.&#34; I say looking at Braka.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Cacique, we will honor the sacrifice you have done for the pack!&#34; I just look at all of them with what I imagine is a blank face and I nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayoán lets Braka take charge of the relocation of the people, while he, Morgana, Yaya and Gloria take me to The Fort. When we arrive it looks totally different from just yesterday, it looks like it did before the treachery of The Council...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sister, the Alpha&#39;s Chambers are ready for you.&#34; I only have been there once with Luna Isla, she never used the Luna&#39;s Chamber, that was a way of living from before, but it&#39;s not like it would be eliminated. The Alpha&#39;s Chambers were huge, with the best view to the ocean and an open half roofed half Moon balcony that could be enclosed like a cocoon in case of an attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to know that I have put Nina in charge of doing some add ons I need and doing some remodeling here, so whomever lives here feels at home and of the design of a city to be built in Uguaca Bay. So whatever bullshit you have with her get over it.&#34; I don&#39;t want to hear shit about it. &#34;Awe c&#39;mon Izzy!&#34; He says with the most childish tone I have ever heard. And the look I gave him was enough to shut him up and make him comply. I feel more powerful being here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find the best historical architect Master to revive the old citadel and I want the modern part of Itiba to look worthy of a modern metropolitan city, again work with Nina. l also want The Luna&#39;s Chamber be prepared for Luna Isla to her liking, she will remain Luna of this pack and she will be treated with the same honor and respect as before, is that understood?&#34; My voice sounds monotone even to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you say Alpha.&#34; Then to his mate. &#34;How long is she going to be this way again?&#34; Morgana rolls her eyes. &#34;As long as it takes for her brain waves to adjust to it, so you will have to get used to it for now, after what she did for the pack she deserves a damn break stop being a damn jackass! What&#39;s your problem? You fucked up yesterday and here you&#39;re doing AGAIN!&#34; She answers totally annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree with Morgana, Beta... What the Alpha has achieved is dangerous and could have cost her sanity, the spell is keeping her together, she needs rest. You are in charge but she is still Alpha, one who is lacking emotions now, they will come little by little, so lets make sure that rage and anger are not the first to come for all of our sakes. So deal with your own issues! You agreed with this plan, so now follow through!&#34; Gloria says. Can&#39;t argue with that logic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she addresses me... &#34;Alpha with your leave I will go to OPIA HQ with my team to make sure everything is on schedule, I will contact the Beta with any news... But I want to thank you for your courage and sacrifice and congratulate you on the success of your mission. I know you don&#39;t feel the pain now, but I assure you we will investigate Alpha Kayden and try to help you piece what you saw... Remember, from what you have reported so far, he might be innocent. When you are ready we will be available to verify the timeline.&#34; I just nod at her, I don&#39;t care for any of this right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just walk away to the stairway that leads to the Alpha&#39;s Chambers, I just don&#39;t want to talk with anyone right now, I want a bath and to be alone. I open the double doors into the massive rooms... Is this necessary for one person, alone? A King sized four poster bed with pure white linens and a white mosquito net hanging from the roof. Kayden comes to mind again, I feel him for an instant and just as quickly the thought is gone. The rooms are full of natural light from the five open dark wood narrow doble doors that lead to the half Moon coral stone balcony. The breeze is the perfect temperature with the delicious salt air of the ocean and the sound of the waves breaking way down below on the bottom of the rocky cliff. It beckons to me and I go out, I swallow the salt breeze, but I have no emotional response as I know I usually would, yet I still sit on one of the couches that surround a small fire pit in the middle. The sudden urge to roast marshmallows with my children here enters my mind, this spell isn&#39;t just messing with my emotions, but my mind is compromised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get up and verify the massive walk in closet and it has a few ítems and a note:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Greetings Cacique!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am Master Ximena Le Blanche, I will be coming tomorrow to take your measurements to create a beautiful wardrobe worthy of a Queen. I am honored to serve you Cacique, in the meantime I have left some items that you can use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Your loyal subject,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddame Le Blanche</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subject? The items include several pijamas in different textiles and colors, a few dresses, robes, cloaks, jeans, t-shirts, shorts, bathing suits, sandals, flip flops, heels, boots... I think all this is enough yet I remember that I&#39;m Cacique now and how I look represents my people. I take a pair of cotton white short pijama bottoms and a white lycra tank top and a beautiful purple kimono robe with white plum blossoms at the bottom and go in the large bathroom. It has another closet stocked with towels and other toiletries. I soak for a while until I have washed as much of Kayden off of me, dress and put the kimono on a chair by the bed that connects to a sitting area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lie on the bed and stare at the white ceiling with dark wood rafters through the net and let the ocean lull me to sleep.</p>
