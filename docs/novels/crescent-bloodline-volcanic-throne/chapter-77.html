                <p>Guanina&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These days have been so wack that I am definitely ready for some Mediterranean choice meals! I got my dark cocoa curls shinning in the sun, I put some eyes drops to cool down the red and let these amber puppies shine! I got my tattoo on my shoulder, no way am I following no damn trend, this is permanent and I don&#39;t want no damn entity making me go wacko, I can do that by myself! Kyra has been impatient all morning for something new, I have been celibate for over a month now and I can&#39;t take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet as Izzy&#39;s family we are to wait for Oceani Luna and Lune Primière in the throne room. There&#39;s supposed to be about 8,000 more wolves coming and I already made sure to have enough of the yet unnamed city ready. We focused on keeping a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing design. Since we didn&#39;t didn&#39;t have any historic buildings to protect we allowed our imaginations run wild. It&#39;s not complete yet but already it&#39;s looking splendid in my not humble opinion. I personally wanted to wait till they arrived to brainstorm with some of their own Kappas to integrate architecture that makes them feel at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The throne room is large enough to hold over 3,000 people but like with Alhilal Almuqadas, the open grounds in front of The Fort are ready to tend to anything they might need they will be taken to the new city by bus which is an over an hour drive. Izzy didn&#39;t like this planing, and she made a good point. They have been weeks at sea and not in a cruise ship, she wanted to receive them at the Uguaca Docks, they would be tired and probably would want to get settled and rest. But even Tía Ayiti objected, they wanted to ensure the stupid pomp and circumstance, plus they wanted to give a chance for everyone to greet them to give a chance for mates to meet, so Izzy accepted the terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was looking smoking hot already showing a little bump that just popped out of nowhere, still it suited her. Ximena dressed her in an Imperio style sleeveless backless dress with her chest fully covered and crisscross rope around her neck in sunset orange that made her own amber eyes pop! And the draping of the skirt part of the dress was exquisite. She wore dark leather gladiator sandals, a custom gold arm band around her right arm ending in two wolf heads one going up and she other down. Golden chandelier earnings with leaf trimmings and Isaura out did herself with the Queen&#39;s Braid adding some yellow pearls here and there with very light natural makeup. The gold Guanín to finish the look. Suania and Freya thought she looked like renditions of Cleopatra until I showed them pictures of coins showing what Cleopatra really looked like... But she did look like the Hollywood version.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the exorcism, of Bayoán, the little news outlets that worked before the blowing up of Mt. Cemí were starting up again and they were having a field day taking pictures of her. In between takes I could tell she was feeling uncomfortable. I got her some tea with two Tunu drops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, here drink!&#34; She takes the cup and takes a sip. &#34;Izzy you&#39;re going to have to learn to get used to this you did great with Alhilal Almuqadas!&#34; I try to comfort her but she&#39;s on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina last time there were only about 150 wolves and no reporters... This is way too much! Can you hit me with another drop? And I know I&#39;m going to have to get used to it, but right now I&#39;m not.&#34; I pour another drop in her tea and she takes a deep breath and exhales slowly. And her Mark shines yellow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They inform us that the Alphas are arriving with their entourages with as many of their people as the throne room can hold. And then I see him and he sees me! It&#39;s like a match has been lit and he is yummy! He has a very dark blonde shoulder length hair and light brown eyes, a sharp jawline and high cheekbones frame his face and his lips carried a devilish grin. He must be at least 6&#39;4&#34;. I couldn&#39;t stop smiling at him! So THIS is what it feels like to have a mate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Izzy greeted them and all yada yada, I link Bayo: &#39;Yo! who&#39;s the one with the long hair?&#39; He looks at me and I imagine that he already noticed Kyra and she frowns. &#39;That&#39;s Alpha Antoine from Lune Primière, are you serious Nina?&#39; He asks. &#39;I&#39;m hella serious he&#39;s my mate!&#39; And Bayoán looks at Antoine looking at me! &#39;Hold it Nina, don&#39;t interrupt. Izzy&#39;s nervous enough!&#39; Does he think I&#39;m an Idiot? Well I think he&#39;s one too, so that makes us square! &#39;Duh, dummy don&#39;t you SEE me chill?&#39; He rolls his eyes. &#39;Well play it MORE chill because he&#39;s not paying attention! Avert your eyes to Izzy so he follows suit, this is important Nina!&#39; Shit! I lead his eyes to look at Izzy and he smiles and pays attention, yet we give each other little glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bring out the chalice and Izzy slices her wrist twice so that there is enough blood in it for everyone including those outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he drinks and is in the Link... &#39;Bonjour mon chéri! I have been looking for you for some time, what is your name beautiful?&#39; Ekkk! French! &#39;Hola a ti también mi amor, my name is Guanina and I have been waiting for you as well, my brother says your name is Antoine?&#39; He wets his lips. &#39;Oui chèri I--&#39; I see Izzy going to them to seal the deal. &#39;Mi cielo, pay attention my sister comes!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he blinks and takes Izzy&#39;s forearm and shake, she already has noticed and slaps his outside forearm playfully with her other hand giving him a knowing smile. She goes to whom I believe is former Alpha Cesar and takes his arm as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You are sister to the Alpha?&#39; He says forgetting the whole ordeal. &#39;I am her older and funner sister and I can&#39;t wait to have fun with you!&#39; His smile turns into a silent chuckle. &#39;That sounds promising! I can&#39;t wait to claim you finally!&#39; He glares at me with the devil in his eyes, oh yes! He&#39;ll do nicely! &#39;You better mate!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our secret conversation is rudely interrupted by duty. Izzy calls me to her side... I go up the stairs to where she returned to the Dujo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my sister, the Master Guanina who is the principal architect in charge of building the new city where you shall all be able to reside. She wishes to invite all of your Kappas who are experts in design and architecture to help adapt some elements to make you all feel more at home and finish making a beautiful city!&#34; She was awesome! She was exalting me in front of my mate! &#39;A Master Architect my little one?&#39; I give him a devilish smile. &#39;Among other things...&#39; And I already SEE him get aroused and I can tell he scents mine. &#39;You are a mischievous one my petit chèri. Let&#39;s finish with all this.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Izzy invites everyone to feast I see him link someone. &#39;I have just linked my ex Beta Louis to take over here, is the somewhere we can be alone&#39; And everyone leaves to go outside... &#39;Follow me!&#39; And I gide him to my rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second we are inside we lock lips and we start getting rid of our clothes. He takes a good look at me and I can&#39;t rip my eyes from his eyes, his lips, his chest, his cock. I have had my fun with men and women, but DAMN! He is more than I could&#39;ve dreamt for. &#34;Quite acceptable!&#34; I say lifting my gaze from his cock to his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Acceptable?!&#34; And he laughs. &#34;Well you chèri are a marvel!&#34; I walk to him and he takes a handful of the back of my hair and and starts sucking at the place where he will place his mark and oh my Goddess the fire in my body rises! This feeling is totally new, I rake my nails down his chest and going down myself, I want a close examination of what I will be working with and lick his tip making him sit on the bed and I take him fully in my mouth and he rewards me with non stop growling. He tries to bring me up but I slap his hand away and I let Kyra take over &#34;MINE!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughs with a growl and his canines are out and his eyes pale grey. He finishes in my mouth and I swallow him up but he is still hard and this time he doesn&#39;t let me go and kisses my lips again. &#34;I see you are a indeed a gifted Kappa Master Architect!&#34; I laugh at his jist and he throws me on the bed opening my legs, the scent of cinnamon and wine so strong on him and he gives a little teasing lick at my clit and just at that he has me moaning. I look down at him eating me up and I tangle my fingers in his long hair, I feel through the Bond my moans are driving him crazy and he climbs on top of me and goes inside me filling every inch of me! And he trusts into me over and over and my moans turn to screams of pleasure, I feel that he worries about the sound, he just got here and already in the bed of the Alpha&#39;s sister! I laugh internally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Don&#39;t worry about the sounds mi amor, every bedroom is sound proof!&#39; He looks at me with surprise and a smile. &#34;Master Architect indeed!&#34; And he turns me around pushing harder until I come in waves and when he is about to come himself he moves my hair out of the way and as we come he Marks me with a roar and holy shit! That&#39;s the best orgasm I have ever had! I get my bearings and push him under me and start riding him moving my hips in round motion and he grips my hips digging his fingers in and his head is back with little growls and moans. &#34;Tu es une déesse chèri!&#34; And I am about to come again I feel his pulse inside of me about to spill in me again and my canines are out and just in the correct moment I mark his neck and we finish spilling everything we have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stay there holding onto each other for a while and we open our eyes and he gives me a deep kiss and I feel the connection grow exponentially.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34; He says. &#34;To listen to others say how it is you would think they are exaggerating!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach over to my night table, purposely grazing my breasts to his face and pull out a joint for emergencies and light it up. &#34;Yeah, no shit! I thought is was bullshit too!&#34; And take a puff and offer it to him. He takes it and takes a deep puff. &#34;You are truly perfection chèri! I even get lit after that! I will truly love you untill I join the Goddess!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn better Tony cuz you you&#39;re stuck with me!&#34; And I lean over and give little kisses down his jaw and down his neck. I take the joint and push it in the ash tray turning it off for now. I go back to kissing his lips and he wraps his massive arms around my waist holding me in place and cleans my mark and gives it many little kisses. &#34;I am so happy that we took the deal, I can already tell that I am going to love living here!&#34; And we start making love again. &#34;I will make sure that you do!&#34; I whisper in his ear.</p>
