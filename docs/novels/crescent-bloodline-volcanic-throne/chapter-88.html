                <p>Phoebe&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood next to my Queen in the throne room as has now become custom, she had returned my dignity and a place of power whereas my own people and family shunned me and didn&#39;t care if I lived or died. We have grown to understand each other&#39;s mind helping me give her as much insight that the blood in my veins of those who shunned me gave me. As fae/elf and mate to my beloved wolf Jacob I was able to join the Link and could silently give her the information that she needs, it&#39;s good to feel needed, it&#39;s good to feel respected, it&#39;s good to feel that she regards me as a dear friend. She soon will know that I too shall be a mother, not even Jacob knows, I just found out!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These new members stood before her and I could read that they had never seen anything like her, I felt proud to be a part of what she is building. Her regalness matched that of Queen Titania of the Seelie, yet not with the same level of arrogance of the uppity cunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To receive these new members Master Ximena dressed her in a blood red, low cleavage dress that had a bosom corset top to not touch her ever swelling belly. The sleeves were long geisha kimono style with earrings of a single large round ruby in each ear and The Guanín resting on her cleavage. Her hair was in it&#39;s intricate Queen&#39;s Braid that reached to the middle of back with beads of rubies here and there. Master Isaura made sure to give her a smoky eye makeup look, they wanted to show her as powerful, the Alpha of one of these packs had showed reluctance to a woman&#39;s rule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I did get that sentiment from some of the males, the one called Modou didn&#39;t care about it, his mate was pregnant and he wanted to protect her yet understood that he couldn&#39;t do it where they were without putting her at risk, yet some in his group were skeptical and Alpha Dawda wasn&#39;t liking it at all, he only gave in when his pack and his own son Yengiga deposed him right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I welcome you all to Karaya Island and am glad the operation to extract you was a success.&#34; Loiza said yet giving Dawda a killing glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Modou and Yengiga stepped forward bowing their heads, they were grateful for the escape yet they oozed skepticism, I linked the feeling to Loiza... &#39;Gotcha&#39; she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m aware that for some of you the mere idea of a woman being your Alpha is difficult, I understand your sentiment, it&#39;s indeed a rare thing. Our own people have had a limited amount of females who have held such title, yet here we are and this is MY rule. Yet if this is something that you can&#39;t accept, we will simply give you Forgetting Potion to take our location from your memory and send you on your way and you can choose your own destiny wherever you please. You&#39;re not our prisoners but our guests, yet for you to stay and to ensure the safety of MY OWN people, the terms of union to our pack and submission to me must be met. If not we will give you transport and you may go. The choice is yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of leaving is scaring most of the people, since arrival to the airport they were able to see what this paradise is like in the half hour drive over to The Fort. They saw how free and happy the people are and how they go about their lives in peace not having to worry about constant attacks. Just that drive alone convinced the overwhelming majority that they wanted to stay and belong. I linked this sentiment to Loiza and she tapped her finger on her lap telling me that that she understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up... &#34;For those of you who do wish to stay this can be your home, after you&#39;re initiated into the pack you&#39;re basic needs like a hot meal, medical attention and housing will be met. We will also conduct a census of sorts so we know what your ranks are to determine which will be your strongest contribution to the pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The now ex Alpha Dawda stepped forward in front of Modou and Yengiga. &#34;Do you think you can seduce my people with this place?! We have have existed for hundreds of years! My dynasty extends to before the colonizers came, we have might---&#34; Loiza didn&#39;t let him finish, she went to him and shifted her right hand to her claw and slashed Dawda&#39;s face with a strong roar! Every new comer gasped and Dawda put his hands to his face and roared back at her, but she extended her hand towards him and lit him on fire for a short moment as to ensure he lived. Every single one of them knelt in submission any doubt of her power gone, every one of us were smiling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dawda was on his hands and knees... &#34;YOU DARE still have the balls to think of yourself as a leader of any kind?! YOU who put your people and those who risked their lives from Senegal to come to your aid in danger! YOU who because of your stupidity risked the lives of MY OWN KIN FOR YOUR FUCKING PRIDE?! You are not worthy of my mercy! You STILL LIVE NOW BECAUSE I ALLOW IT! You don&#39;t want to be led by a woman yet it&#39;s YOU WHO IS WEAK! You are so mighty yet had your people living behind walls, are you the dumbest cunt on the planet?! Your son and your people showed courage with their determination to survive and fight along our people to leave the life of misery YOU lead them to and STILL show disrespect in MY Court?!&#34; Alpha Yengiga stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mighty Alpha our people wish to stay please forgive my father, you speak truth! He has been incompetent for more time that I wish to accept, it&#39;s truly my fault. I should have made him stand down years ago when I noticed that he was not the same Alpha he once was. We accept all of your terms, swear submission to you and look forward to a life here. You are definitely nothing like we expected.&#34; He bowed his head in submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;He is sincere my Queen, he is absolutely in awe of your power and is actually fearful to be sent away, they all want to be lead by you and stay.&#39; I inform her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;And Dawda?&#39; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;He is in shock but is furious.&#39; Her claw goes back to being a hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ask you Alpha Yengiga, if you were me... What would YOU do to a Wolf like your father, whom was cordially invited to your territory and showed the disrespect he has shown here today in front of your people? Would YOU have granted mercy? I wouldn&#39;t lie if I were you, I WILL know!&#34; I smile, she is putting his father&#39;s fate in his own hands in front of his people and exposing what kind of leader he would have been to them. If he says mercy he himself exposes that HE is weak! And he&#39;s REALLY thinking hard, but he KNOWS that if it would have happened to him, he would have killed him... I link this information to Loiza. &#39;Copy that.&#39; She responds, she continues to glare at Yengiga.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you usually take this long making simple decisions Alpha Yengiga?&#34; He closed his eyes and sighs. She has put him on the spot and he can&#39;t defend his father anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have had his head for such an act Alpha.&#34; And she smiles at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I thought! And WHY would YOU have had his head?&#34; General Braka&#39;s smile is priceless! It&#39;s so rare to see him have such a large smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has not only shown disrespect, but has proven he is untrustworthy and a threat to my people which is something I would not accept in my territory.&#34; He says weakly, he knows what his very own answer means for his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very wise indeed Alpha Yengiga, maybe your people would have not been in the situation they were if indeed you would have made a stronger move. I am glad you understand what must be done!&#34; And once again her hand turns into a claw and with her water power lifts Dawda&#39;s body so that he is at the very least standing and with her claw slashes his head from his body ending him with her face unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that this matter is over and done with do you all wish to remain in Karaya with me as your Alpha and submit to our terms?&#34; She asks serenely her claw back to being a now blood covered hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Modou and Yengiga step forward again and no bowing heads now but they land on their knees... &#34;We do mighty Alpha all of your terms shall be met and our people shall now be your people and I hope that Dawda&#39;s insolence shall not make us lesser in your eyes.&#34; Modou says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, and don&#39;t worry, Dawda&#39;s actions are his own and that&#39;s how it shall remain, just take it as a warning that just because I am a woman doesn&#39;t mean I will tolerate stupid bullshit from anyone! Bring the chalice so that we may officially welcome our new brothers and sisters to the fold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguelina, the head house keeper of The Fort, comes with a large bowl of water as Loiza goes back to the Dujo so that she may clean the blood from her hand and not pollute the blood she will spill. And the usual ritual takes place and we feel them enter the Link and many from the pack welcome them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna Isla, please escort our new people so that they may eat and get the care they deserve as Osupa.&#34; Luna Isla smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you command Cacique!&#34; And she escorts everyone to the grounds for the feast of Caribbean food and medical check ups that await them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loiza stays sitting in the Dujo looking at Dawda&#39;s lifeless body, she is thinking about how this could have been avoided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza, forgive me but this had to be done. You calculated all your options, his mind was full of rage and could have tried to rally those who may not like you, to cause a greater tragedy. With this you only had to execute ONE person, with his own son&#39;s blessing, instead of many in the future.&#34; She closes her eyes knowing the truth of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Lady Phoebe is right Cacique. You did what must be done.&#34; Braka says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tía, make sure Gloria instructs Víctor to be as CLEAR as possible with our terms to the packs that he will work to bring. I don&#39;t want to welcome any more members in this manner again, if they don&#39;t agree with a single term then I prefer to leave them to their fate, now if you excuse me, I&#39;m all bloody and my boobs are killing me with this corset, I wish to be alone for a while. General, you know what to do.&#34; She is very tired and hungry and wants to visit the shrines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do Cacique, it shall be done as usual and your orders with regards to the prisoners is being met.&#34; He assures. And she stands up to leave walking over Dawda&#39;s corpse and leaves.</p>
