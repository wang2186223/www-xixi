                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well that will sober you up fast! I go to where Maco is lying Amelia on the floor and put my hand to her belly and examine the water of the amniotic fluid to verify how the pup is. She&#39;s calming down her laughter to catch her breath. Everything is well, but she did give us a scare... I can already feel her focusing her water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my Goddess! I REALLY needed that! I don&#39;t remember the last time I laughed so hard! As my hand is still on her belly making sure that the placenta is still attached I feel my little niece kicking up a storm! I take Maco&#39;s hand and put it there and he smiles kissing his mate while helping her up holding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it seems that she&#39;s going to be a jolly little girl! Looks like she&#39;s really going to love laughing!&#34; And everyone goes ahead to the ever so annoying act of touching a pregnant woman&#39;s belly without asking! Yet everyone feels the pup and Kayden takes the opportunity to touch Amelia and deliver the Blessing he had prepared for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Remember to delay it a bit Love!&#39; If his Mark appears the moment he touches her everyone will start to have a little suspicion. But since everybody is touching her it will seem like something out of the blue!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I know babe, I have her, I&#39;ll absorb the sizzle so she doesn&#39;t get startled. Just be ready to explain it, ok?&#39; His Blessing will include Maco and the pup, it&#39;s going to be a Hereditary Blessing Mark like the one Gaia gave him for us. It will inject health into the main branch of our family which is Maco&#39;s, in turn it will feed ALL of us! He already told me we won&#39;t allow Lola to keep her pain and will help Ishaan, as much as he hates the idea of him joining the other Betas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he let go he came over to wrap me in his arms and then it happened while some lingered touching Em&#39;s belly... Apollo&#39;s Mark appeared on both Maco and Amelia&#39;s left wrist and since Kayden absorbed the slight pain they almost didn&#39;t notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did this come from?!&#34; Maco saw it on Amelia and then on himself. Since I already told them what it was they became confused. As Maco helped Amelia up everyone started to go back to their seats unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I already told you guys it&#39;s a Blessing from Apollo. He&#39;s one of the gods of health, so he must be watching over your pup Maco!&#34; I hope that does it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;IZZY! Why say his name! We don&#39;t know what deity is looking for you!&#34; Bayo says started. Yeah we do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not Apollo. He already knows where I am otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have gotten his Mark myself.&#34; I wave it away so they relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; Bayo asks cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup! Very! Let&#39;s finish eating! Nina is there anymore of that hazelnut chocolate tres leches from earlier?&#34; We all sit but Kayden and I can feel them worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, sure, Nía can you get it?&#34; Nía always wants dessert!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a deity after you?&#34; Marcus stopped laughing a while back... He just took the brownie and ate it with us before asking what it was! It&#39;s been hysterical ever since!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup! That&#39;s why I have all this ink on me... It makes me invisible to him. Don&#39;t worry it&#39;s fine.&#34; I link Kayden: &#39;A little help here!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While we are on the whole car thing, Bayoán, is there a way to bring the cars we have in Virginia over? We only used them for show but here they&#39;ll be used for their purpose!&#34; Smooth... Bayo used to race until he started spending all of his free time with Moira. Maybe now he&#39;ll join us! I never got to race him. Maybe he can have his rematch against me NOW! If he couldn&#39;t beat me when I was a 15 year old Gamma, I&#39;ll rip him to shreds as an Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tony was asking about the same thing! The Lady Conceição passed her Prime Priestess examinations, the boost in power should allow her to open a portal for two maybe three at the time. Since the attacks from The Council stopped we can take a breather and besides from Solas Na Gealaí Clan we don&#39;t have any pending extractions. We&#39;re still investigating Wives of the Gods Coven, in New Orleans, and I want the whole story about this war of theirs. Everything moving forward should go smoothly if everything put in motion goes according to plan. What cars do you have?&#34; Awesome, Bayoán took the bait! &#39;I love you!&#39; I link him and he kisses my cheek. I haven&#39;t felt this happy ever!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well we have five and I think Everett does want to bring his Dad&#39;s &#39;37 Cadillac Phaeton, too, he had already given it to his heir Jonas. He would sometimes take it out with his mate Abigail and just drive it to Devil&#39;s Drop, Samuel told me that the patrols said they would just sit in the car holding each other while Abigail sobbed.&#34; We have been treating them both here and Sandro told Kayden that they are accepting what happened, and besides therapy they have a prescription of a very particular strain of cannabis that helps the neuro pathways of someone in their state to accept the guidance of meditation at the Shrines or Temples easier. Cressy has been assisting them and many others of Half Crescent Moon, she is the best at growing particular strains of cannabis like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Originally he didn&#39;t want the car, the other day he told Kayden that he was starting to feel hope again and asked if there was a way to get it since it was in the Blood Moon garages as well. There was nothing really left at Half Crescent Moon except for the spirits of the departed. Both him and Abigail are still in their prime, this doesn&#39;t have to mean the end of their bloodline. Sandro explained to them of the many treatments available to spark Abigail&#39;s Heat again. He says that she has found a lot of peace since they arrived and likes running through the rainforest, they still can&#39;t get over so many naked people at the beach! By the Goddesses It&#39;s not THAT many!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayoán nodded. Now that they were inside the Link everyone is receiving their pain and retuning sympathy. &#34;That&#39;s a fine car! Nina, look for a picture, you&#39;ll like the design features of it. We can definitely do that for Alpha Everett.&#34; I think it&#39;s fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just keep thinking about getting Hacienda Florencia, we will have an estate with plenty of room to grow our family. Mami was right in making sure that this house is in tip top shape but Dad had a plan of expansion, he was already taken into consideration all nine of us and the children we would have. Which means he was calculating that our family possibly would increase in numbers. Did he figure out what happened to the generation after Adelola and Imotonex? I&#39;m going to have to read his diaries too! To be given such a big blessing and then for it to be basically taken away instantly SOMETHING must have happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beach house idea is completely brilliant, and it won&#39;t cost that much. In this I do trust Nina fully if she thinks we can have BOTH properties for the correct price I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s possible especially with the little trump card she wants to play with our great-grandpapi. At that altitude and that weather it&#39;s also ideal to grow cocoa! We would be able to house Ishaan&#39;s family as well as Nasser&#39;s, Adam&#39;s and Cesar and Catalina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Nina, when things get a little calmer outside and we&#39;ve settled everything here I would like for an inspection of the house in Granada, last time we went there it smelled of humidity and some of the wood work was rotting. We always use it as a safehouse, ok?&#34; That WAS a fun month!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, I went months before the blast and checked it out, I was planning on spending a few months over there looking for new inspiration. I already sent some of the furniture to Jorel&#39;s studio, but you know how it is, she&#39;s absolutely backlogged right now. And I always rather spend my money with family, plus we always get a discount. Nía, there&#39;s even MORE of Asenath&#39;s clothes over there! I think I know were I get my shopaholic nature from!&#34; As long as it should be fine for now. And now for my ultimate Imotonex move of abuse of power and ensuring future financial prosperity for our family to pay for the all the other projects I want for future generations while trying to make sure not to empty out our account...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maco, as we know the humans keep destroying this planet and at this pace the waters will continue to raise. I would like for Wolf Skull Inc. to come up with a defense system to protect the whole island and adjacent areas from not just waters, I want a system that if those crazy motherfuckers destroy this planet Karaya will remain. If the air is too polluted, it will be clean here, we have their nukes locked, but until we are able to FULLY disable and disassemble their cores they&#39;re still a threat. Let&#39;s just say that I want a system that can protect us and our waters from even a GOD. I&#39;m giving you and Gadiel a month head start thinking about ideas and experimenting them to come up with the best system, before I announce the proyect then EVERYONE will have three months to present their ideas and designs. How do you think this will change the future of Wolf Skull Inc.? Gadiel might end up trying for an even better family estate...&#34; They don&#39;t really need this advantage, but better safe than sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with the injection of founds from this to Wolf Skull, it could help it start gain a global traction. When Tali and Nina mentioned the companies and other contributions our mates&#39; packs intend to do another idea popped into my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow Izzy! I bet Imotonex and Abuelo would be proud! Your taking the family to another level of piracy, bootlegging and smuggling and are an even bigger mobster!&#34; Bayoán says with admiration. Oh you have no idea where I&#39;m going with this yet!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want to be my conciliary?&#34; He just chuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously Izz?! A project of this magnitude can put us to compete with the really big fish!&#34; It damn better!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very serious! And I want you to start thinking as a big fish yourself and tell the same to Gadiel, this will be the biggest government contract Karaya has ever undertaken, do you think you guys can do it?&#34; He is linking, I imagine talking with Gadi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gadiel is at the drawing board right now Izzy! It&#39;s in the bag!&#34; Excellent!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Earlier Tali and Nina talked about you boys handing over assets and companies, correct?&#34; Kayden already knows this plan and I will really need him, Marcus, and every single Alpha and Beta with experience in this area heading this. To be honest we haven&#39;t ventured our businesses off island because of our distrust of humans and other packs, so even though we have professors on the matter, that have done practical study, most is theorical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oui Izzy, Nina said that she talked to a professor.&#34; Tony said while Nina served him some rice and he gave her an adoring smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we handed Bayoán all the documents of our personal accounts for the family and the businesses of the pack. Everyone else from the pack opened their own personal accounts with their own founds... Oh Adam your brother has yours since we knew you were in The Fort and kinda figured you were preoccupied with someone, which, yeah! Dude don&#39;t ever just disappear like that, the only reason we were chill is because you felt calm and your scent was fresh, no decomposition detected. We even gave Avis&#39;s mom his share, he told us to fuck off last time we tried linking him! Seriously man! Do the Spogels practice kidnapping often?!&#34; Oh, Marcus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I thought you warned him?&#39; We know Avis is having the time of his life, we sent Sophia to check and Edit is very happy that she has two of her remaining 4 daughters mated and can&#39;t stop pampering Jason and Avis. She gave both Sammy and Brianna a condo in Atabex City, I was talking about the same with Maco. To start investing in condos here and there for when the kids reach that age, Amelia thinks to add an account for each. We all agreed to to do that so they each have their start up, regardless of the family&#39;s properties or money, we just want them to know that they will have a backup. Nía volunteered to help Nina find some nice ones, she&#39;s pretty well connected. Kayden and Marcus handed their family assets and we told Marcus to start negotiating again for the vineyard in Nappa the minute the housing market crash... It&#39;s already happening. All of their stocks got hit badly on what they&#39;re now calling Black Tuesday the 2nd! Ha!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I did baby, but you know how he is, it&#39;s fine.&#39; He&#39;s so calm enjoying his meal, he&#39;s also really high! It&#39;s so funny to see how both brothers act so differently, they make quite an adorable pair! He may have been ignorant about many things but Kayden and Marcus focused their education mostly in economics and finance and they administered their company really well. So they each also have their own personal wealth, they each opened accounts and Tali and I added ours to the ones of each of our mates. And they&#39;re already considering moving operations for the company out of Richmond to Miami.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>L: &#34;It&#39;s Sammy Marcus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>U: &#34;Yup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>S: &#34;Their experts!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>G: &#34;Pffft!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>N: &#34;Babe I told you that you wouldn&#39;t se your friend for a while! Sammy&#39;s been busier than Joey, we just made her baby sit you guys because Izzy was so worried about Kayden even though she wanted to rip his lying tongue to the point where the esophagus stayed connected and she actually pulled his stomach out through his mouth! You remember Izzy you went into great detail!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>L: &#34;Your damn right! Even if there was no piece of the stomach I still would have been HAPPY!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>K: &#34;HEY! How much more do I have to grovel here?! Adam did you ever see any of those fuckers do any of that?! Seriously? My stomach!&#34; He whines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;ll make it up to you later, stop whining.&#39; I can&#39;t help kissing my mate, the God that was supposed to be my husband...</p>
