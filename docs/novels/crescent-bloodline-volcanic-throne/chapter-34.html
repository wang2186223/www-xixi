                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A freaking portal opens up out of nowhere and out comes what I can only imagine to be the top Priestess of the Goddess. She&#39;s more or less as tall as Iza, with dark caramel skin, her eyes were obsidian with no whites and thick lips, a tattoo that starts at her bottom lip and goes down her chin, down her neck until it is lost covered by her white cloak which was adorned simply with runes lining the hem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lady, I am honored that your most noble self has bequeathed upon us your magnificent presence!&#34; Bayoán says while kneeling before her with arms wide open and head bowed, shit this must be serious...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that how it&#39;s intended Yaya?&#34; Bayoán asks the other Priestess with a smirk. Wait, he was just messing around? And then to the Priestess... &#34;Was that not a great show of humility My Lady?&#34; He says as he stands up and dusts himself off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut the bullshit Beta I am aware of fake flattery and your insolence will be the end of you!&#34; The Priestess who came out of the portal responded. Is he trying to die?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that makes my job a whole lot easier My Lady, I love cutting down worthless banter, did you bring the sword?&#34; And I hear Yaya gasp and cover her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a lot of nerve Bayoán, calling out the Goddess&#39;s own name demanding the Sword of Peace for an execution! Do you have a death wish?&#34; Did Iza really name HIM Beta?! He mentioned the Goddess&#39;s name?! What is Iza&#39;s strategy here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right! I should have just gone ahead and ask for Excalibur itself, but since Excalibur cannot carry-out Avalon law for this particular crime I did not ask for it. As for my nerve, I remind you My Lady that over 24 hours have gone by since the attack on our Island, and so far the only one who is actually helping is the Goddess herself, why did you not contact us the moment you knew that we were attacked? Avalon hasn&#39;t even sent an inquiry. So I ask you again, My Lady, did you at least bring the sword?&#34; This guy is crazy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What evidence do you have that you were indeed attacked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;He is insane, and now I don&#39;t know about your mate&#39;s judgment!&#39; Marcus mental state is decaying, but his beta brain is still registering all the information. However I have a feeling that crazy IS Iza&#39;s strategy, she is a Priestess herself and by the way Yaya reacted to Bayoán asking for some sword, I imagine she would also be more formal with a past mentor. So she needs someone who will cut the formality and make a stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You tell me My Lady. What evidence could I have if Avalon hasn&#39;t even sent a team to inquire on what happened with the mountain while we are in the boonies? A mountain may I add is supervised daily by Priestesses that YOU yourself trained. Whether you like it or not My Lady, The Goddess keeps manifesting herself in favor of our people, she has basically crowned Loiza and just last night my brother met his Twin Soul. And while we&#39;re on that, why didn&#39;t you send more Priestesses to fetch the unicorns and investigate the crimes committed here? I&#39;m pretty sure that the Goddess must not be pleased knowing that her most precious creatures have been taken from her most protected Sanctum.&#34; The Priestess just stands there pondering what Bayoán said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was here last night too, she was inside of Willow when Freya claimed me with shining turquoise eyes.&#34; Loiza&#39;s other brother adds to their case. I could tell them right now and take the Priestess to my mother to get her confession, but what happens after that? Will they execute her too? SHIT! It was hard enough disowning them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Priestess drops the hood of her cloak uncovering a shaved head crowned by a ribbon tattoo and inside that ribbon every single phase of the moon and runes which I can only imagine are incantations for protection, also her ears are like the elven girl we took out of Vanessa&#39;s house, is she an elf?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would suggest you tone down your arrogance Beta, I have lived for over a thousand years and usually when vermin speaks to me that way I make sure to crush it with my boot.&#34; She tells Bayoán. Damn, over a thousand years old?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No thank you! It seems my arrogance is an effective way of keeping your attention and it&#39;s a good thing that I&#39;m not of a size that fits underneath your boot My Lady, pray tell me Moira, what was the Goddess&#39;s answer to my plea for the Sword of Peace?&#34; Why does he need a sword?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Priestess Moira hisses at him and it actually DOES sound like a cat! &#34;Your arrogant demand HAS been granted by the Goddess, she does not wish to have those undesirables in her Realm and she has already decided with Hades and he will take them from her to condemn them as he sees fit. Their only condition is that their own Alpha swing the sword.&#34; And Bayoán starts laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, what was that? I was going to interrogate them to know who their seller is.&#34; I answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lady forgive me for not introducing you this is Alpha Kayden Black of The Blood Moon Pack, Alpha this is The Lady Moira of the House of Aranda, Grand Prime Priestess of Avalon, the Lady of the Lake and Keeper of Excalibur.&#34; HOLY HELL!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t need to interrogate them for that information because that rogue situation that you blew out of proportion, considering the fact that you have slavers in your pack actually answered that question. Anyway that rogue turns out to actually be a victim and my new sister, that makes TWO members of MY family who have been bought and sold, so as of NOW I am taking this matter very personally. It turns out the ringleader of all of this is Alpha Marius, who not only is keeping people of different species as his own personal property and business, he has not shown up to uphold a Blood Oath. Those are two very serious crimes under Avalon Law, breaking a Blood Oath will garnish you banishment, however holding people against their will is punishable by Death. That&#39;s why you need the sword Alpha. I also suggest you send your Beta to rest, from what I am assessing from him he doesn&#39;t seem to be registering as quickly and is mentally crumbling. I&#39;m sure that as his Alpha and brother you must have felt that already. We can however offer both of you something to calm both of your nerves.&#34; He says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Marcus and I know his mind has been crumbling since last night. I have clearly underestimated Beta Bayoán and feel vindicated on Loiza&#39;s judgement to name him, he is in complete control, even with regards to Priestess Moira. He seems to know BOTH Council Law and Avalon Law and I just remembered that he was a Captain of the military. Iza and General Braka aren&#39;t even here, they are tag teaming and actually working as a PACK.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have some questions and I will accept your help, clearly I don&#39;t have my shit together.&#34; And Yaya gasps again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yaya calm down! Moira is old enough to have heard every curse word in every language, also, don&#39;t you see she is here to HELP! She KNOWS the value the Goddess places on Karaya. I am also sure she heard EVERY single LEGAL request that we, as wards of Avalon are entitled to and will follow through respecting the rights bequeathed to us by the Goddess herself, she even granted the sword. So I am POSITIVE the Lady Moira will fully cooperate with us... isn&#39;t that RIGHT My Lady?&#34; Damn he IS in FULL control and it reminded me of what Marcus said about Loiza&#39;s WILL and how it broke Kevin, who hasn&#39;t said a word since, he hasn&#39;t even changed his pants yet...</p>
