                <p>I don&#39;t have anything else to say to Nina, I said everything I wanted to say and Tali just put the nail in the coffin. Either way, I linked Maco, Amelia and Izzy...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>U: &#39;Guys I think we just let her put her money where her mouth is, let her literally pay the penalty for her shit and let it go.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>L: I agree, I feel through the Bond that she&#39;s on the verge of tears, and she really is giving it her all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>M: I&#39;m with you guys. She&#39;s been putting in the work and even though she&#39;s busy with the other projects, she comes over for a few hours to restore the paintings and the other over the top shit in the vault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A: I think we can come up with an arrangement and yeah, she&#39;s been working her butt off to make amends. How much are we going to punish her for behavior that she has been correcting, I say we give her the chance to atone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina, please calm down. I think we&#39;ve given your ass fair retribution for how you&#39;re actions fucked us over and we have all seen how you have stepped up and chilled since Izz became Alpha. So don&#39;t cut yourself short, it&#39;s not just Tony&#39;s influence. With that said let&#39;s talk money... Nina what number did Tony calculate that you owe just me?&#34; Tony&#39;s calculations don&#39;t mean shit if she didn&#39;t mention EVERY time she would give an IOU to Maco, either way he has every single one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He calculated ₲31,000.&#34; She says in defeat... That&#39;s roughly about $90,000, but that number sounds about right. Maco was an idiot giving her that much!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup, that&#39;s exactly correct! Thank Tony and thank you for being honest and not holding back Nina, it means more than you know. Now to the other number... Nina, Dad paid ₲60,000 to Isabella for her to accept the Alpha Command Non Disclosure Agreement. Remember, Safe Word or not you went fucking overboard! She healed but couldn&#39;t work for a pretty good while, she&#39;s a TOP paying model Nina, Dad had to compensate her lost income... you went out of your budget and made relations with the Saint Germaines more complicated. Sure they apologized for not obeying their Izzy, but I&#39;ll leave that for HER to handle... You say that you have the amount to pay me, I will accept your payment. You&#39;re going to handle the yard right?&#34; We all look at her as she drank the rest of her wine before pouring herself more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By OUR law an Alpha can&#39;t get involved in petty gossip and give an Alpha command to just shut someone up over a PERSONAL squabble, we HAVE free speech after all! This wasn&#39;t a pack or top security secret, this was Nina wanting to play Dominatrix with a hot chick! And that&#39;s FINE, but she&#39;s the Betas&#39; daughter and she chose to play too hard with the wrong person, she just doesn&#39;t stop and THINK!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gúarionex and Dad would have broken the law and acted like a tyrants if they would&#39;ve commanded Isabella without consent, and that&#39;s without mentioning creating a big rift in the pack with us and the Saint Germaines at each other&#39;s necks, AGAIN! We&#39;ve been trying to REPAIR our old feuds with them and here Nina comes and takes Dad&#39;s efforts back threefold! He was already negotiating with Augustus to invest in rituals for a Mating between Suania and his second son Erbao who was REALLY into her. She thought he was cute, but Nía was more like me in that regard... We really didn&#39;t care if we found our mate or not. They both found their mates anyway, so it&#39;s not like it matters now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sigh. Yes Patriarch, I have the amount to cover ALL my debts, including the ₲60,000 Dad paid and yes, I will cover every expense for the yard.&#34; She says in a low and solemn voice while looking at the burgundy colored liquid in her glass with a gloomy stare... Ok, whatever else I hate to see her like this. Nina is always full of life and laughter, I really want to get over this day already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, Nina I&#39;m only going to charge HALF of what you owe me but the rest I want in labor. You want the yard to be the legacy you leave our family and I&#39;ll let you go to it as soon as you want. I will make sure our records show EVERY contribution you, Tony and your line brings to this house. However the part you owe me will be put to use on the other issues of the house as MY OWN legacy. You&#39;ll take care of the family burial chamber and I want all the basement refurbished and turn the dungeons into a good storage space, just make sure to leave intact the cell that housed that piece of shit Mengele, besides everything else he did, that&#39;s also a part of Abuelo&#39;s legacy to this house! I will help you with the tech needed to keep out any humidity and the such, also Morgana said she would add the same enchantment placed over her house in Brooklyn. We shouldn&#39;t even have to dust the house anymore! She had already tested it with Yaya and Izzy to make sure it doesn&#39;t clash with Adelola&#39;s spell.&#34; What that monster did to Babka&#39;s mother, our own great grandmother, her sister and her family has no name. The fucking humans allowed him to escape to Argentina, before moving to Brazil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abuelo brought Babka to Karaya before WWII even started, they only had news of weird shit going on in Germany with the Communist Party and the growing NAZI Party. When Kristallnacht happened, Agüebaná III ordered it investigated. So Marushka moved here with no worries for her family or her pack back home. Abuelo wanted to impress her, so he stole a fucking yacht to bring her and ANYTHING she wanted here! He had made a VERY good amount of money in the 20s with the bootlegging to Tampa, so he took her on a shopping spree and she brought a lot of fancy shit and a ton of family heirlooms from both Russia and Poland. Nina IS RIGHT, we ARE turning into HOARDERS! That is one thing we ALL agree in this family... we have to get rid of a ton of crap! Not even Nina who&#39;s the Kappa wants to keep it! I&#39;m telling you go to the Oller&#39;s house and it looks and feels super cramped! And their house is almost identical to ours! Thank the Goddess Dad sold that yacht along with the boats Abuelo used for smuggling rum and weed into the United States! While bringing back peyote and their cactus, that he would trade with The Tonkawa Tribe in Oklahoma. Yaya&#39;s temple has a huge green house where she breeds, grows and harvests them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only cool things they brought from our other ancestral countries was the Kuznetsov family&#39;s sovnya, named &#39;Konets&#39;! It&#39;s a two-handed polearm that dates from the FUCKING 10th century! It&#39;s by far the oldest weapon in our armory! It still has the Kuznetsov&#39;s coat of arms and Abuelo commissioned the steel Masters to engrave our OWN family crest on it. The moment it entered our armory it was blessed by Adelola&#39;s protection spell. It&#39;s like she designed it so that just by adding the family crest it was then and forever OURS, and we had LOADS! Just the collection of Spanish rapiers Anani&#39;s father brought was enough for an exhibit. Ensuring her OWN legacy in the family which, DUH! She&#39;s literally EVERYWHERE! You can&#39;t have a damn bowl of cereal in this house without her looking! They were the epitome of go big or go home!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also brought a Bayonet Bagnet 28&#39;! We NEED to get a Poln M29, Poln 98, Karabinek to complete the piece, but it still looks good and it&#39;s weight is comfortable. And a Karabin samopowtarzalny wzór 38 M, WHEW! Thank the Goddess it&#39;s our other mother tongue! We grew up among Spanish, Polish and Russian. Izzy and I spent most of our time in Eastern Europe, ESPECIALLY Maco who DOES look Slavic! I would usually fein an accent so that my cover was believable! Good times!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s a self repeating rifle model 38M, they&#39;re very simple but they&#39;re actually pretty cool! And the piece of resistance... A whole armor set from Poland! Nina put everything apart and cleaned them really nice and put them back together making sure not to damage the betina of the weapon. Between Warrior families we always say that it&#39;s a LUXURY to have a Kappa in the family! So far none of us have given birth to a Kappa, we have yet to see when Maco&#39;s and Amelia&#39;s daughter is born.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Germany invaded Poland in 1939 Babka was already pregnant with Tía Ayiti and she was worried sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We have ALWAYS infiltrated other countries with our methods, but what we have NOW... A HEAVILY organized spy network? OPIA? Sure, but The advanced tech to contact those far away?... No. All of that was in it&#39;s infancy. Our scientists and engineers had already increased the range of the Morse code we used, we already had sonar and cloaking, but long range comms? A satellite in orbit? Not yet...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abuelo couldn&#39;t stand seeing Marushka like that and prepped a team putting the old bad back together: Pedro, Bjørn and Björk, to head out to find Alpha Mikołaj and Klan Księżyca Lycan. He was gone for months yet he made sure to be back for his daughter&#39;s birth and to care for his mate, but came only with rumors that they had fled back to Russia and others to Czechoslovakia. Babka wanted at the very least to have her mother and sister with her, and Abuelo flexed his muscle to assure them sanctuary. Alpha Agüebaná III was willing to meet Alpha Mikołaj and give them ALL sanctuary. A few months after Ayiti was born and with Marushka healthy, Abuelo head out again with the others and backup to scour all of Eastern Europe looking for them. He would be satisfied is he at least found Alexandra and Verushka alive or dead. They followed a lead that some of the pack were captured by a particular NAZI scientist who ended up being a damn vampire with his own agenda to find more weakness in Warewolves!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doktor Jörg Schäfer was infatuated with his human prodigy, Doktor Josef Mengele, the fucking Angel of Death, and had the intention to turn him. In Shäfer&#39;s diary he would ramble about what a visionary Hitler was and and how Heinrich Himmler was a genius. He compared Warewolves to Jews and Gypsies (Romani) and that the world would be CLEAN without us! We don&#39;t get involved with human wars but we were VERY close to entering the ring here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way Abuelo found our great grandmother, Alexandra Kuznetsov and brought her and her grandson home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verushka had met her mate Ivan Sokolov and had a pup, Alexander Sokolov-Dukovich. The pup was still untouched, but what his tender eyes saw be done to his parents and grandmother, scarred him for life and Alexandra wore an eye patch covering the her empty left eye socket. Verushka and Ivan didn&#39;t survive. And it took Abuelo and his team a day and a night to find their remains in a pit a few miles from the camp and brought them home for Marushka&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abuelo and his team liberated the wolves in that camp North of Treblinka, bringing back documentation EN MASSE along with Doktor Jörg Schäfer who spent a few weeks in the dungeons until Abuelo compiled the evidence against him. Mengele had already been transferred to Auschwitz to keep with his disgusting experiments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Agüebaná III sent this information, a COPY of Jörg&#39;s diary along with his head (Moira did the honors, Selene didn&#39;t want him in her realm, she doesn&#39;t mind war, she DOES mind the genocide of ANY of her creatures) to the head of his Blood Clan as a warning to keep their people in check. And since this became an Avalon matter, Moira went herself to hand our pack&#39;s gift to Reinheit im Blutclan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sent an apology letter disassociating themselves from what Jörg did, along with a coffer of gold for the compensation of the victims and one of four of their baseball sized Blood Rubies as a gift to the pack as a thank you for ending him and what they called: &#39;... a very distasteful ordeal...&#39; And &#39;... shameful subjugation to humans lesser nature and stupidity...&#39; Moira took Blood Ruby to Avalon to verify foul play. They didn&#39;t find any. However the Lady Ziggy, Yaya&#39;s mentor, wanted to double check. She loves Yaya and was really embarrassed by what one of her kind did, she waited with Moira until the full Moon to purify and Bless it with the blood of her tears and the light of the Moon before handing it to us personally with her condolences. Our pack has trusted Ziggy for almost a century, she made sure to make Yaya powerful and Izzy said she was very doting with all the girls. Moira was Izzy&#39;s mentor in the Misteries, but Ziggy was her archery and sword Master. Either way, Abuelo hunted that son of a bitch down and was able to find him in &#39;63 in a small village on the border between Brazil and Paraguay, right before The Great Warewolf War.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By that time the only people who lived in this house were Abuelo, Bapka, Ayiti, Dad and Alexandra... Alexander found his mate in Edith&#39;s Spogel&#39;s sister, Marianella. They even lived in the Small House for a while, he IS a reputable Chi reconstructive neurosurgeon and even though most of his 5 kids, our kin, have the Spogel mutation, most are Chis, too who have been working everyday repairing the damage many received from the blast. He and his oldest two were receiving special training in Switzerland and were among the missing for a while. He founded the Sokolov family; his family crest brought from Russia dating to the 16th century and Marianella&#39;s Dad Erik bought them a condo Downtown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexandra divided the coffer of gold given by the vampires between Alex and her part she gave to Abuelo and Marushka as thanks for bringing Verushka to rest since she had no expenses by living with them and she wanted to contribute to her other daughter&#39;s standing in the family. Alex and Gadiel have been negotiating with Bayo and Isla to buy the Real family ancestral home, Maco started vouching for Gadiel, while Bayoán is more inclined towards Alex. However Izzy told them both to keep out of it because it has nothing to do with us and to leave Isla decide whatever she wants. I don&#39;t have to ask Izz anything to know she&#39;s got extra info, so I haven&#39;t said shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abuelo had the Doktor in that cell for months allowing Marushka and Alexandra claim their vengeance. However, Alex wanted more than just a quick satisfaction... He handed Mengele over to the Human Studies Department, a subsidiary of the Biology Department of the University, so they could study human pain tolerance and the most effective ways to extract information from them on him, giving them free range to go about it however they wanted and no one showed that monster any mercy. Alexander&#39;s only condition was to keep Mengele alive and lucid for as long as possible and to prepare him for what Hades would dish out to his soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lived to a ripe old age full of pain and misery... In the end there was only his torso and his head left, not even his cock and balls were spared. JUST as he was dying, Dad wanted to fuck him over one last time and ordered for him to be burned alive, denying him even a peaceful death! Ayiti took his ashes to a pig farm in Germany, where she dumped them in the mud with the pigs. Alex, Ayiti and Dad didn&#39;t want to pollute Karaya or the ocean with his remains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We never met Abuelo and only Maco, Nina and Bayo remember Alexandra. Shit Nina even painted her portrait when she was 7, and it&#39;s VERY close to her pictures! Maco says that sometimes she would call Nina by Verushka&#39;s name and she always talked in Russian or Polish, never caring to learn Spanish and would always have a tall glass of vodka with ice. For all the therapy she received she couldn&#39;t get over loosing her daughter and her mate, great grandfather Szymon...</p>
