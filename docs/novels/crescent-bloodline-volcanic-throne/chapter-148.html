                <p>chapter to leave, I wouldn&#39;t put it pass Loiza to finish them if they make just ONE wrong move, and now that Kayden is with her it will be even simpler.&#34; Simpler?! I nod to her in understanding yet not the part about Kayden. And she walks out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point everyone was shouting trying to talk over one another! Ugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;STOP!&#34; I roar at the top of my lungs using my Beta command and everyone is silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is SERIOUS! The Grand Prime Priestess of Avalon is officially extending an invitation to finally go to Karaya. We will hold a VOTE!&#34; From my calculations running this scenario before I already know it&#39;s conclusion. So let&#39;s start with the easiest...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who votes for us to stay?&#34; Murmurs again. Thomas stands up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With respect Beta, most of us WANT to go... My questions are what are the conditions for us to go? And will we be treated like pariahs once we&#39;re there for what a few did?&#34; He sits with his family. They are mostly Kappas and so far their beer is the best!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will have to bring in the Lady Moira for those particulars Thomas, what she wants to know is if WE as a pack accept the invite. From what I have studied of Alpha Loiza she doesn&#39;t seem the type to scorn on ignorance and if she invited us it means she&#39;s fine with us. Besides with Kayden by her side do you think he would allow that for us?&#34; They start murmuring again. Avis steps in:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think that because The Osupa handed The Council their own ass we are safe? THINK guys! We have ALWAYS had attacks! Thomas, wasn&#39;t your mate killed in a regular rogue attack 4 years ago? That had NOTHING to do with The Council! I personally want to go for several reasons, but mainly I want to be as strong as them, so yeah, I want to be trained by them and with what Jason has reported, the life they live is I want for my family! We have already decided... My family accepts Queen Loiza as Alpha according to what our Alpha wishes for us!&#34; I know Avis&#39;s ginger head has been thinking very much about this, he has his mother and sisters to watch for and his Kappa brother is now finding sculpture as his main drive. It&#39;s stressful to know YOU are the best shot your loved ones have to survive the worst. And he opens up that feeling to the pack so that they understand that it&#39;s not just a power play. He wants to be able to achieve his goal of getting stronger to protect his family but at the same time he wants peace of mind that they are safe and happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The minute he ended his words the whole pack went silent. Everyone was linking with their families. After almost an hour the pack said yes on moving! I fetched the Lady Moira so she can give the particulars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will be asked every questions that every other pack has received before being allowed into their sanctuary. There will be powerful Truth Seers who will easily detect any lie. There is no spell needed, as you have already divided yourselves among the Greek coding every single discipline will be nurtured and encouraged to grow. But believe me their training for EVERYTHING is rigorous, they strive each day to reach perfection. As for the Warriors I guess you know what that means for you starting from the very top, every single Alpha born in Karaya Island is receiving intense training as the first line of defense and the strongest in the pack. A team will be sent over shortly for the questioning and to help extract you from here and take you to the island. I can already feel many of you worry about things you will leave behind, since this area is actually quite safe right now I recommend you pack everything you wish to bring, but remember you can always come back to fetch whatever else you want. As the world is right now, there is so much chaos that you can probably fly in and out of the country without any problem especially with Osupa technology. The main problem was the constant attacks from The Council and that has been neutralized for now. Does anybody have any questions?&#34; She concludes with her voice sounding stale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you My Lady, when should we expect the team to arrive?&#34; At my question three portals open. About 30 Osupa come out and we hear her... Her voice no longer adorable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HEY YOU BUNCH OF CUNTS! DID CHA MISS ME?!&#34; And Josephine comes out and pounces on Avis like a cat and gives him a hug, after she kicked his ass they became friends and they never said goodbye because he didn&#39;t go with us to London. Jason walked out with another girl who looks A LOT like Joey! This must be Brianna... Damn! He looks bigger than on screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo Leo! Are you ready for warmer weather man?!&#34; And he hugs his best friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you kidding me?! My sister keeps going to the mall with friends and getting new bathing suits! I want to get a board! Yo man, LOOK at you! You look buff as fuck!&#34; Jason laughed at that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bathing suits? Nah man! They have REALLY nice shops down there! And they&#39;re only used sporadically. But do use them around the Mermaids, they ALWAYS want to play with your---&#34; SMACK!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really Jason?! Maybe he WANTS that! Just like YOU used to... REMEMBER?!&#34; Brianna smacked Jason behind his head. Ok... So Brianna is younger than Joey but she sounds like she can rough someone up just as well... She&#39;ll be good for helping Jason grow up!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No my beautiful Frost Faerie, I completely forgot about EVERYTHING! Before meeting you nothing is worth remembering.&#34; She gives this triumphant smile and he takes her hands and his kissing them and kissing her lips after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow! So that&#39;s what being pussy whipped in less than 24 hours looks like!&#34; Avis interjects making us laugh. But Jason cannot control his smiling! Looking directly at his mate he answers very matter of factly ...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup! And what a perfect pussy to be whipped by! I really hope to be whipped by it every single day! Maybe someday YOU&#39;LL also know how awesome it is Avis, that too will help you relax after training, trust me!&#34; Brianna blushes furiously and Joey starts laughing hysterically!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aw man! I don&#39;t even know who I&#39;m laughing at anymore this was a collective burn here! Jason! That was a GOOD one you got both Bree AND Avis! Are you having a dry spell old buddy? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m pretty sure Jason will like to give you guys the tour The District. It&#39;s always fun to go! Especially when you don&#39;t have a mate and you still want to unwind without having complications of a relationship!&#34; We&#39;re all a little confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious Joey?!&#34; Brianna glares at her sister, eyes still retaining it&#39;s dark limbal ring but the irises turn fully white! Her wolf&#39;s eyes are white?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever Bree! I&#39;LL take them so you can go ahead and whip Jason more with your pussy!&#34; Whoa!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;BUUUUURN!&#34; They all shout at the new mates, BOTH now blushing intensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even TRY with me baby sister, your whining works on Sammy not me, wrong twin kid! Anyway, yeah it&#39;s going to be better when more fae come, but guys we have to focus on NOW, get Samuel over here, I need the Epsilons to secure our exit plan. Marcus, Avis, we need the census you guys made, the techs will input the data and take blood samples to make sure every genome is verified, we&#39;re always on the look out for mutations which will make our pack stronger. Also it&#39;ll help with accounting for everyone, we want to KEEP Karaya secure. Understood guys? Remember Karaya is sanctuary to ALL of us you want to make sure that those we fight for are safe... That&#39;s how the pack survives.</p>
