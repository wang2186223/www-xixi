                <p>Bayoán POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So she said that, huh?&#34; The Lady Sumayah just informed me of Izzy&#39;s latest command, she invited what&#39;s left of Alhilal Almuqadas here. Thanks Izzy just as I didn&#39;t have enough shit to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for that information My Lady, I will take up with the Lady Moira.&#34; She stands and curtsies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Beta, just to know that what is left of my people is secure will give me great joy, my brothers are strong Warriors and I am sure they will be great assets to Karaya and my sister is expecting and grieving the lost of her mate. Alhilal Almuqadas, will do their part to be dutiful Osupa, I shall take my leave to continue watching over the Alpha.&#34; I stand to escort her to the door. The Lady Sumayah is a reader... I know damn well she knows they are killing me. I swear this is conspiracy to drive me stab myself with a silver dagger and end it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is off duty and is still bossing me around! I link Izzy but I remember she blocked it! Ugh! So I go to sniff her out, yet her scent takes me to The Luna&#39;s chamber, I was ready to go to the damn Combs to get her. When I arrive I see, smiles and laughing and tea!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here I was looking for robot Izzy but find Alice sipping tea with the Mad Hatter!&#34; And more laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Beta I&#39;m not wearing a hat!&#34; Isla responds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey that was a good one! We don&#39;t even have a white rabbit!&#34; Izzy jokes. Well isn&#39;t this just splendid!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess your block took hold? Since everything looks quite peachy!&#34; Here I am with work up to my eyeballs and she&#39;s having a damn tea party!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I could go for peaches right now!&#34; Izzy says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry mija I just linked Domingo, he thinks you would like them caramelized!&#34; WHAT?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayo my block is taking hold but I&#39;m still in between moods, give me a break! Here want some tea? A few Tunu drops will help you chill out!&#34; Chill out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy you just invited another pack of refugees, what are you thinking?&#34; Making my job impossible, that&#39;s what!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I was thinking that Sumayah would like her mourning sister be able to not have to deliver her baby in a fucking cave! I was also thinking that since they are leaderless and in hiding it would be the right thing to do since Sumayah has helped me. Also Alhilal Almuqadas only has about 150 members left and I would be a shame if the bloodline of their particular breed were to go extinct! Should I go on dear brother?&#34; And Isla takes a sip of her tea while raising her eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how do you propose to get them here safely? They&#39;re in a war zone.&#34; Although I can imagine her plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Bayo, I&#39;m not used to hearing dumb questions from you! Their numbers are tiny, you know how, so quit bitching about it and get to it!&#34; Bitching am I?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy, Avalon is helping us and preparing the all the evidence for the war declaration! And---&#34; Damn knock on the door!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you get that for us dear?&#34; Isla asks...Ugh! She KNOWS I won&#39;t say no to her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to the door and get the tray, it DOES smell good! And I place it on the balcony table and they go at it, are they even paying attention?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn these ARE good, Mamá can you thank Domingo, I don&#39;t want to open my link yet, still a mishmash in there.&#34; She says taking another slice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With pleasure mija I am so glad that you got your appetite back! Eating for three will be a challenge!&#34; Ugh! How does she know? Who am I kidding, this woman is the most connected person in this pack!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayo stop stressing will you, I already knew, I&#39;m sure Moira explained how we are trained. I KNOW my body, do you think I wouldn&#39;t notice two heartbeats besides my own? And Mamá knows everything. Here taste this!&#34; I sit on the chair to her left and take one while Isla serves me tea and puts two Tunu drops, enough to calm me but not drowsy me out for the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy they found the Priestess who lost her Mark that day...&#34; She almost chokes on the slice of peach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was it?&#34; She takes some tea to wash it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mortiana.&#34; Another granddaughter of Morgaine Le Fay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh wow, how&#39;s Morgana taking that?!&#34; Sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not well, she is mortified, stressed, devastated... She cried and cursed for a whole day!&#34; My poor prego Brooklyn witch...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well she shouldn&#39;t, she comes from a complicated bloodline. Just because we have an idiot cousin should not reflect on us.&#34; Good point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what&#39;s the next move?&#34; She asks taking another slice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We want to present the declaration before you start showing your bump.&#34; So ASAP.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When am I due?&#34; Oh boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well according to the records for Alpha Kiskeya AND Alpha Ayiti, yes we found those as well, in about four months.&#34; And immediately she shakes her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, no not happening, not like that!&#34; She responds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what do you suggest oh mighty Alpha?&#34; I have been on them to speed it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am due in January and my hormones are all over the place! So AFTER I give birth and my head is sound and I have had a little time to recover and enjoy my babies, so February sounds good. My mind will be in tip top shape to cream them, I am not walking in there with my babies inside me and me not fully in control to defend myself, so do a do over on your plans and get a portal to bring Alhilal Almuqadas. Name Phoebe my official Truth Seer, she is the most powerful Truth Seer I&#39;ve met plus she&#39;s a reader. I want to appoint her and Orwell to my council, so tell Nina to get whomever did my rooms and Isla&#39;s to work on apartments for them here at The Fort.&#34; Yeah those pregnancy hormones are wreaking havock on her brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to bring a VAMPIRE into The Fort?!&#34; And she sighed aggravated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup! They BOTH have roles to play, stop with the questions and trust my judgement. Brother I KNOW you have a lot going on and that everyone is pushing you especially me, but I trust your judgement, I trust Dad&#39;s teaching in you and I trust you can take it and more. You are one cocky motherfucker, but inside I know you have always doubted yourself putting out this joker front... Well, you are no joker anymore, you are the Bata of The Osupa. Now is there anything else you want? I have plans for dinner with Isla and Sumayah to celebrate that the rest of our pack will be here soon, Oceani Luna, Lune Primière and now Alhilal Almuqadas are coming, as well as me not being an emotionless robot, tomorrow I have plans to check up on Maco and Amelia.&#34; Dinner plans?! And Isla gives me &#39;The Look&#39; of &#39;Do your duty and fuck off.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you want the vampire&#39;s rooms to be?&#34; And she rolls her eyes at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His name is Orwell, so start by treating him with respect, and you can ASK where he and the others feel more comfortable, SIMPLE!&#34; Right, Phoebe has a mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, about that, Braka thinks you should have a personal guard and thinks that with training Freya, Helena and Jacob could be good candidates. Jacob hasn&#39;t stopped surfing since he learned and it&#39;s getting on Phoebe&#39;s nerves&#34; She raises her eyebrows. and gives a confused look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that really necessary?&#34; I can tell she hates the idea, but Isla steps in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mija this is a very good idea, your father and Braka proposed this to Guario, but he dismissed it. Anytime there was a threat to me, Yadiel or the family in general he would loose focus. So I agree with this plan, it should be structured to protect you and those who others can use to make you vulnerable and loose focus on your task.&#34; Thank you Isla!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what do you think? Izzy we ARE going to declare war...&#34; I ask hopeful, this would include protection to my own family and help ME focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She takes a deep breath and the way her eyes are moving I can tell she is going through every scenario.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine... We&#39;ll put it on trial. Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No ma&#39;am, I&#39;ll contact Moira to tell her of the changes in the plan and the portal for Alhilal Almuqadas and get Phoebe to check everything&#39;s good with them. And yes the vamp-- Orwell too!&#34; She just added on so much crap and my brain is exhausted. I&#39;ll need to go to Tatiana, or even Sandro latter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you big brother, I have every faith that everything will turn out fine!&#34; Whatever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave you ladies to enjoy the afternoon and dinner after, I have a boatload of work to do!&#34; I say gritting my teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re doing your father proud Mijo!&#34; Isla really had to push it in...</p>
