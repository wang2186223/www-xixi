                <p>Umbros&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit, shit, shit! Where the fuck did she go? I follow her scent back to The Fort. She has her link blocked from me, damn it! Since meeting Adam I didn&#39;t really think of any problems except for them knowing, but they&#39;re right! Why was I freaking out about it when I see it all the time here and no one says gives a damn! Maybe I AM spending too much time off Island. I go to her apartment, I KNOW she&#39;s in there. I start knocking, but nothing. Great, the ever so effective Silent Treatment!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon Lola I know you&#39;re in there, let&#39;s talk about this!&#34; Man, I&#39;ve been so angry at her for years. When Enzo found out he just started ignoring me all together before warning me to leave him and Lola alone. I felt disgust from him, but now that I read it a little bit better he wasn&#39;t disgusted at me per se, he was disgusted at the fact that I would try to make a move on my sister&#39;s man! I thought that Lola had told him to do it. Shit! I didn&#39;t need her pounding my face to know she didn&#39;t know ANYTHING! Ugh! I could CLEARLY SEE that she was truthful! Nina and Bayo have been going at it for over a decade! I can fix THIS!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LOLA! C&#39;MON I&#39;M SORRY! I&#39;LL STAY HERE YELLING AT THE DOOR UNTIL YOU OPEN!&#34; Brilliant! I&#39;ll just threaten her! I totally got this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LOLAAAA---&#34; She opens the door and she punches me SOLID right to my mouth! Damn it! My tooth! Not again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SON OF A BITCH!&#34; Ugh! I&#39;m holding my tooth to take to Daniella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YEAH, YOU ARE! You and Mami are FUCKED UP in the HEAD!&#34; And she slammed the door in my face!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Tali? Dear little sister? I need your help...&#39; She could help me negotiate this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;FUCK OFF DICKWAD!&#39; Well she&#39;s no help at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go downstairs to Daniella and she puts my tooth back regenerating the nerve endings with water, she&#39;s shaking her head all the while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you keep fighting with her you&#39;re going to loose one of your teeth somewhere there isn&#39;t a Daniella to put it back! As your primary physician I strongly recommend you two stop!&#34; I&#39;m trying but she doesn&#39;t want to listen!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see Adam at the door of Daniella&#39;s little clinic... I had told him not to leave the room. We decided not to Mark each other yet until we talked with our families but it just so happens that our Alpha is a Priestess of the Goddess who would totally BANISH us! She WOULD be following the law anyway, the risk to the rest of the pack from such an act could weaken us! They give you Forgetting potion and they send you on your way no matter what your family says! It is a HIGH CRIME to reject a mate here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you told me to stay put but...&#34; I have been an asshole to him too! I made him hide and doubt. I stand up and kiss my mate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Adam, please forgive me baby!&#34; He kisses me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you two get a DAMN room! We&#39;re still on working hours! And if the next tooth YOU bring is from a fight with one of your sisters or your cousins you better find yourself another doctor who put it back! Now GIT!&#34; Yeesh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You fought with your sister? Damn she got you good baby!&#34; And he didn&#39;t see how it was before, if it wasn&#39;t for Izz using her water to help me heal I would still be looking pretty bad. Damn it! Ever since she was born she&#39;s always had the upper hand!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah you should see how I left HER!&#34; This is humiliating!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she all right?&#34; Is she alright?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t have a SCRATCH on her! Come on I need to solve something!&#34; We go upstairs to our rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Solve something?&#34; Yup!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah...&#34; And I proceed to kiss him and take my clothes off and he rushes to follow suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adam, I want to Mark you... Baby I want you... You&#39;re MINE!&#34; I was holding back for the sake of not loosing control and Mark him. He&#39;s already panting but I hear a soft &#39;yes&#39; from his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We made love and MARKED each other. And. Oh. My. Goddess!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It feels AMAZING! I can feel EVERYTHING in my body strengthen, my blood feels like it&#39;s pumping fire in---&#34; I feel like I&#39;m in a trance. But his adorable self cuts me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby, how long do plan to hide from your sister? Dude you fucked up big time!&#34; Ugh! I cuddle towards his smooth, hard chest. At least I Marked my mate! Shit, I didn&#39;t say anything about him and his family. He has his brother, sister in law and his two nephews... I have two more nephews from him! If I wouldn&#39;t have been a cowardly moron I could have vouched for him and his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His family is staying over at &#39;Ammonite Tower&#39;. It has an oval-shaped, glass façade similar to the coiled shell of an ammonite fossil. It has a glass exterior that will allow maximum exposure and transparency of the building&#39;s inner-workings and grants a lot of natural light. If you don&#39;t want your apartment to be exposed, all you have to do is press a button and the glass turns dark from the outside looking in. It has steel railings will provide &#39;armor&#39; to shield the structure from The Caribbean climate. It has a mechanism that in an emergency the glass turns into an impenetrable alloy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can pull some strings so that the boys can study here and get the BEST education and training! Who am I kidding?! The only string I&#39;m going to pull is my hamstring when Izzy separates my leg from the rest of my body if I don&#39;t fix this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I KNOW! I have no idea how to fix this, she won&#39;t even listen to me!&#34; I&#39;m feeling like shit after the most important moment with my man! Damn it! Nina got hers good and was forgiven, and she screwed EVERYONE! I still don&#39;t know about Mom, I&#39;m FURIOUS with her! I have more nephews AND another sister and a BROTHER! And now that I recall, Cesar did mention that Catalina&#39;s eyes and mine are the same dark indigo blue, his are more sapphire, very similar to Lola&#39;s. Damn! Fine Daddy-O you had blue eyes! We ALL have them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon babe, let&#39;s take a quick shower and go talk to her, before heading back to the house, ok?&#34; He&#39;s really sweet but I&#39;ve never seen Lola this pissed at me! He pulls me out of bed and helps me shower and rubs my shoulders trying to take my tension away. This feels so good, he puts his arms around me and kisses me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon hot stuff, I&#39;ll do the talking, ok? You just stay quiet for now.&#34; I just nod, I FEEL the determination Izzy said he has and I&#39;m feeling bolder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok.&#34; We get dressed and Adam knocks at her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lola, It&#39;s Adam! Your dumbass brother&#39;s mate! Can we talk?&#34; YO!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Seriously! We just MARKED and already you&#39;re betraying me?&#34; What a traitor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see?! That&#39;s where I DO have the upper hand! Since I HAVE been with women I know what they like to hear. And they LOVE, hearing us say how much inferior they think we are compared to them! Watch and learn Love!&#34; Learn?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already know you two are conspiring! You can come in, the dumbass stays outside! I don&#39;t want to see him EVER in my life!&#34; Well I&#39;ll be damned! Motherfucker got in!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait here, I&#39;LL talk to her!&#34; He doesn&#39;t know Lola, she&#39;ll chew him up alive! I become a little anxious for him and start nibbling on my thumb nail. Lola opens the door for him and shuts it back in my face! Sure, no problem...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited, and I waited, and then I waited some more until I sat on the floor next to her door feeling like the red Garnet we put outside our door at Yule to ensure that the island always have warmth and never cold. I waited for over an hour! Until the door opened... Adam walks out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s willing to listen to you now!&#34; Is he serious. I kiss him and go inside cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your lucky brother, you have a mate that&#39;s willing to stick his neck out for your sorry ass self. I&#39;m willing to forgive the shit you put me through, but I&#39;ll NEVER forgive you for trying to betray me! Enzo knew didn&#39;t he?&#34; Her voice is scary calm... Sigh, I just nod. And she nods slowly herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder he was so distrustful of you, I even noticed that he wouldn&#39;t even look your way after a time... Why? I LOVED Enzo Umbros! I choose not to move in with him and he got pissed and ended it! I wanted to still be with him, but I accepted his choice, I was heartbroken and you were there to jam the knife in further! I wonder... did you start to have what YOU consider &#39;feelings&#39; towards him before or after I hooked up with him? I remember that you were fine with us at first.&#34; I don&#39;t know if this is a trick question, as a Truth Seer the questions I ask are very specific to make the process of an interrogation more efficient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a simple question idiot... before or after?&#34; I look back in my memory...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After.&#34; It was ME! She didn&#39;t take anything from me. What is wrong with me? She&#39;s silent and looking at Karayita in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lola, I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t take back what I did. Please give me a chance to make it up to you? I&#39;m SO SORRY... I&#39;m sorry he&#39;s gone.&#34; She just keeps looking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you, and how DARE you basically demand me forgive you? Even Nina was more shameful and IS ATONING to EARN that forgiveness. You treat me like an enemy and expect me to forgive and forget the next minute! Do I look like a dumb cunt who can be manipulated and gaslighted?! Fuck you Umbros!&#34; I wouldn&#39;t have forgiven me so easily either, in my head she was the one at fault and I punished her... my little sister, every chance I got. It was words and jabs, and in a few occasions it would get physical, hence Daniella&#39;s warning. But words can hurt just as much as bloody knuckles. And the more she talks the less I want to listen because everything that&#39;s coming out of her mouth is true and I have the curse to be able to see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right, if the roles were inverted I wouldn&#39;t have forgiven you. I gave you a hard time because I thought something else and never even bothered to ask you about it. But that&#39;s because I&#39;M an asshole. Lola you&#39;re not an asshole and how about if I instead of asking for forgiveness I asked for a chance for atonement myself?&#34; She still hasn&#39;t looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;UGH! YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE!&#34; Hey at least she looked at m--- DAMN IT SHE PUNCHED ME IN THE NOSE! At least no tooth was gone! She opens the door and Adam&#39;s there waiting, he has a concerned face... Damn it! My nose must be bloody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before you even THINK of growling at me for breaking that turd&#39;s nose, remember dear spy wannabe bro, the FIRST rule for being a Master Spy is full self control or you&#39;ll blow your cover. ENTENDIDO?!&#34; What did he say to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-- I don&#39;t know what that &#39;entrendrito&#39; means?&#34; His very serious, worried face and the gentle way he asked totally BUTCHERING the word was hysterical and Lola couldn&#39;t help but laugh at him! She wasn&#39;t making fun of him, it&#39;s just that the whole picture looked absolutely adorable! I couldn&#39;t help it and joined her making my already broken nose blow out a dash of blood! And then Adam and Lola couldn&#39;t help it and they laughed at THAT! Lola suddenly stopped laughing and also punched Adam in the face!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HEY!&#34; We both whined at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to hear shit! YOU get that for making me talk to this IDIOT! Now BOTH of you go clean up and round everyone up so I can go get my mate from the hospital and get dinner! I intend to get high and hammered as fuck tonight! At least I know I have another brother I can trade this ASSHOLE for! See you two idiots later.&#34; And she left us there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand baby, did she forgive you or not?&#34; He asks as I put my nose back in place and check that Adam is okay, yeah she broke his nose too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not exactly, but she has drawn enough blood from me today to at least drop it, that&#39;s a good start! Wait till you meet the rest of the women of my family, I admit THIS is my fault, but them bitches are crazy! Do you know how to put your nose into place so it can heal appropriately?&#34; I feel ashamed. If the roles would have been reversed I would have been a total jackass and not spoken to her ever again, but she&#39;s already softening up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really.&#34; He answers. I adjust it before he even has the time to think about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AHHH! A warning next time?!&#34; He gently touched his sexy Greek down turned nose with caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Second lesson of being a spy master, learn to put your bones in place, you won&#39;t have an Omega doing it for you in the field. I heard you were a good driver, do you know how to fly planes and helicopters? And what did you tell my sister that she was willing to speak with me?&#34; Sure it took him over an hour but if it would have been me alone Lola would have never opened the door!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well both your questions go hand in hand, the first answer is yes and no, I do know how to drive, but I&#39;ve already been seeing through your thoughts and you want it for racing. I&#39;ve never raced. We have REALLY nice cars in the pack house back in Virginia and maybe there&#39;s a way to get them over here, but we&#39;ve never really RACED them. I was looking through the opal ring while you were out and I see what you guys do here, but law enforcement are NARCS where I come from, and to go into drag races with humans it&#39;s not something we really wanted to do. But I definitely can learn it REALLY fast, so if we go to The Drag? All I have to do is sit with somebody and once I catch their moves I will definitely be able to race like them or close to it! Your other question... when I got your sister&#39;s scent at the door I remembered it from London. She was left chair to the Alpha in the helicopter, and they seemed to really know what they were doing. I was super jelly! I started studying Osupa methods ASAP! So no, I don&#39;t know how to fly a helicopters or planes but the moment I get a chance to learn it&#39;s usually very easy for me. And as my mate if I know it, you can tap into it right? Isn&#39;t that how the Bond here works? I saw some of the fighting moves Kayden has been using lately, it looks a lot like what you guys do and he was far away from the Alpha. And now we find out how he did it and believe me I&#39;m going to find ALL of your skills, and once I learn what apparently is not that easy for you, so will you!&#34; That makes sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you talked about London with her?&#34; We take off our shirts and clean our face and I know he&#39;s linking Kayden to tell him that we&#39;re going to the house. I think he&#39;s going to be confused...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah! I didn&#39;t talk about you or how slowly she wanted to kill you... well she DID say that if it were up to her you would die the same way that dude Mengele did? I thought they didn&#39;t find him? I&#39;m not sure about that, anyway yeah we talked about the play-by-play of what happened, and she told me some mission stories she had been with the Alpha and Urayoán. After a while she was calm and I just asked her if she would at least listen to you and PRESTO! I got you in! And from what I hear you owe me big time, I know about the thing about you not being able to enter the family burial chamber if you keep messing up. She said they even threaten your Mom?&#34; He asked in a concerned voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Totally, but Mom REALLY deserved it so I&#39;m totally okay with that decision! Besides, it&#39;s joking! But if you REALLY step out of line in a family and they disown you and your remains are cast off... Well, let&#39;s just say that just the THOUGHT of it is really scary to us! Just poke around in my brain later on and you&#39;ll find all that.&#34; We put some clean shirts and head out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you don&#39;t mind me poking in there?&#34; Nope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah! And you can bet your sweet ass and I&#39;m going to be poking inside yours and later on not just your mind!&#34; And what a sweet ass it is!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds promising I&#39;ll hold you to that!&#34; He&#39;s so CUTE! We meet up with Freya by the main entrance looking at me PISSED! Of course she saw EVERYTHING!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess you&#39;re mad at me too?&#34; She rolls her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think genius?! Wait sorry, how could I ever call YOU a genius?! I swear! Some of you sometimes make me nervous for my daughter&#39;s genetic predisposition to stupidity! Either way, congratulations on your new family, maybe THEY will be so kind as to bury your sorry ass bones!&#34; Bayo once said it would be like Ura times two! I can&#39;t get a break away from him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about my bones sweetie! I&#39;m sure they will be rattling after you&#39;re gone!&#34; Ha!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah right! That&#39;s a lot of talk coming from someone who destroyed three cars just by switching on the nitro! Pfft, nice try Mr. Crash Master!&#34; She IS Ura!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s the Crash Master?&#34; And Kayden, Marcus, Morgana, Nasser and Tony show up ready to go. And we walk out, it&#39;s only a 20 minute walk.</p>
