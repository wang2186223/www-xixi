                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Son of a BITCH! Isn&#39;t this a little too much?!&#34; Master Ateney had been working on my back for 3 hours now. Phoebe wanted the Guanín to be at least a little bigger than the size of a dessert dish, she also wanted the symbol that Morgana found to ward of ALL invasive entities tattooed on the outside of BOTH my ankles. The Fort looked like a medical ward full of people who instead of getting their flu shots everyone was getting tattooed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tía Ayiti got every tattoo artist in the island to start here. It&#39;s a good thing my bump had not popped out yet because being on my stomach would&#39;ve been impossible. The tattoo was outlined with me sitting but Ataney is the best at what he does and had no problem with me lying down so that I could read Morgana&#39;s mother&#39;s grimoire were she actually found the symbol that would be tattooed on everyone, It&#39;s a seven pointed pentagram in a circle surrounded by a ribbon with the astrological signs, the Crescent Moon on top, triangles in the four Cardinal points and right in the center of everything the symbol for Earth. Bayoán decided he wanted his on his whole back, that&#39;s how paranoid of having something inside of him made him. I left him to grovel for a bit, but I don&#39;t blame him, he was possessed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to Morgana&#39;s grimoire this symbol comes directly from the grimoire The Key of Solomon and wards off every single entity from any single religion. Like any vaccination, this was being recommended to everyone on the island and people were taking to it, the fact that their Beta was possessed had everyone wanting one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re almost done Alpha, and it&#39;s looking wonderful and don&#39;t worry, it will be healed by the time we start with your ankles.&#34; Sumayah told me after she finished getting hers that everyone in her family was getting it as well. I wonder where Yahir is going to get his, Nasser got his on his right forearm to match with Nia who wanted hers where I have my Priestess Mark... I poked fun at them for being so fucking cheesy, but after the display of power last night, she didn&#39;t clap back. In fact I noticed everyone acting weird around me and it was getting on my nerves. Yet apparently getting it on the right forearm became the trend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phoebe why do I have to get them on BOTH my ankles?&#34; When everyone told me what Phoebe did my jaw dropped, not even a Priestesses of Avalon can cast out anything out of anyone! But the icing on the cake was when Ura told me she basically called Moira an incompetent narcissist! I missed Moira getting a slice of humble pie from a hybrid! But her question was something I myself never asked, WHY if I was a Gamma and now an Alpha was my element of choice water? Sure I use fire but I feel more comfortable with water. That&#39;s why I asked Nina to add ass much of it in the inner courtyard, just looking at it soothes me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Simple, to guard your steps, you don&#39;t want them to be crooked do you?&#34; Sigh, fae folk sometimes take things quite literal. But who am I to question someone who cast out a demon to Hades to be Cerberus&#39;s dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well DUH! Why didn&#39;t I think of that?!&#34; Let&#39;s just get this over with I&#39;m starting to look like a damn bulletin board!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Alpha, all done!&#34; And we go to my closet mirror that&#39;s from head to toe long and take another mirror to look and I actually love it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Ataney you aren&#39;t a Master for nothing! Thank you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my honor Alpha I already have the stencils for the other ones.&#34; Yeah I just want to be done with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you mind if we do this on the balcony? I&#39;ll have lunch brought up!&#34; And he starts picking up his equipment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds good Alpha! I&#39;ll have good light there.&#34; He started with my left ankle and I scent Nia&#39;s new scent with Nasser and Yahir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s the storm maker! I thought you would still be on you belly, we brought food!&#34; Suania says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Food?! I love you!&#34; And she brings out a huge tray with an assortment, with a side serving of Yahir with his tattoo also on the left forearm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you went for the trend, huh?!&#34; He laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well the Warriors all decided to go with the trend in honor of their Alpha, who after seeing what she can do are very enthusiastic!&#34; I could have destroyed the island but people were thinking it was bad ass. The Hell?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enthusiastic? That&#39;s not funny, I could have really hurt people! This is really freaking me out, I&#39;m a damn menace!&#34; And he sits next to me. He reaches over to get the grimoire, and our hands touch-- involuntarily, yet I get chills. I reminded of when I met Víctor...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morgaine Le Fay and her bloodline are no joke, I have heard the legends, yet to actually meet someone of her bloodline is another thing entirely!&#34; He looks over the grimoire. &#34;Yeah, I have no clue how to interpret this.&#34; And he reaches over like before, but closer to put it where it was. He is seriously doing this on purpose and I can&#39;t help my smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, and Morgana is an elemental witch AND a Truth Seer. She is indeed quite powerful. We are lucky to have her.&#34; Nia says feeding Nasser some kofta. Damn it looks good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Samira wanted to thank you for taking Nasser of her list of people to cook for!&#34; And as I reach for one I start laughing taking my hand to my mouth, so he gets me a piece instead and followed Nia&#39;s lead and placed it in my mouth and I don&#39;t know what has me salivating more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay still Alpha, these are more complicated and smaller.&#34; Ups!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Ateney, have some it&#39;s really good!&#34; Ok well that was embarrassing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a piece and... &#34;Damn! your sister should open a restaurant man! It gets really busy down town, it would be a hit. I&#39;ll eat more when I&#39;m done with this outline so don&#39;t eat it all, I want to try everything!&#34; He goes back to my ankle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yahir gets some fresh baked pita and dips it in some homemade hummus and feeds me that, too! Ok, this is too much and I grab it while it reaches my mouth. Nia links something to Nasser and he nods very excited and she grabs his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok guys were, uh... I&#39;m giving Nasser a tour of The Fort see ya!&#34; And they leave and can scent them going to their room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh huh, sure...&#34; And Yahir&#39;s laugh is intoxicating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit! Um, Alpha I have to get my other machine, I&#39;ll be right back!&#34; The Universe is conspiring against me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how have you been feeling today?&#34; So it&#39;s small talk huh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well not in the mood to destroy Karaya with the ocean!&#34; He he.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s very good to hear! I don&#39;t think anyone would be in the mood for you to do that! But are YOU ok? Your babies? And he puts his hand on my stomach and it feels right but at the same time not. I take in his scent, but it&#39;s not right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are fine, my womb is SOLID!&#34; Ok, you&#39;re embarrassing yourself. But the feeling of him touching my belly made me think of Kayden. When was the last time I thought of him? It&#39;s like my mind is doing away with him entirely. Do I want that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He noticed and took his hand away. &#34;You went far away there for a moment. Were your thoughts with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know were my thoughts go sometimes anymore. But it&#39;s difficult right now, It&#39;s like I am in many places at once. Morgana&#39;s Block is so strong that there are days I forget him, yet others... It&#39;s hard to forget when you hear two extra heartbeats all the time.&#34; I want him to know were I stand, I already did something that is highly taboo for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the same with Samira, the first time someone reached to touch her belly after Farooq died she slapped her hand away. Mothers become very protective of their pups, it&#39;s our nature, especially as werewolves, our primal animal demands it.&#34; I am relieved that he understands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to make you uncomfortable Loiza. I can just hope.&#34; I cup his face and he holds to my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One day you will find your mate and she will fill your world... The Bond is so strong that look at me. As much as I am tempted by your offer, and as strong as the Block is, there are instances he pops in my head. I thought that by this time he would have rejected me, yet I know he hasn&#39;t and if I focus enough I can feel his wolf calling to Aryn. I already betrayed the Bond Yahir, I don&#39;t think I can betray him. I don&#39;t know what else to tell you.&#34; He looks at me thoughtfully and lowers his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand, I have not found my mate and in the past years since the numbers of our people declined, some would take a chosen mate, that is what happened with Samira. Beta Farooq was not her true mate, but they loved each other deeply.&#34; He says sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More boats arive tomorrow or day after that from the Mediterranean with thousands more. We were able to port you guys because of your numbers, yet the Priestesses can&#39;t hold a portal for that many people AND help us rebuild. Samira&#39;s and your true mates might be there and still there are more I am willing to invite. Orwell is right now verifying some more vampires that wish to come.&#34; He is thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are they not enemies?&#34; I sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, they&#39;re not, the enemy is prejudice. I imagine Sumayah told you that we have sisters from Avalon from all back rounds and we work in harmony?&#34; He smiles at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sumayah told me... She also told me that you always had revolutionary ideas as a girl that would drive The Lady Moira to &#39;slight annoyance&#39; I guess that would mean angry for an elf!&#34; I give a chuckle. I look down and remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a lock of my hair in his fingers and starts playing with it, looking at it with longing. &#34;What if my true mate has died? Loiza, what if I never find her and you forget your mate entirely?&#34; I close my eyes. I can&#39;t let this go on but it feels so wonderful, to have someone who desires you, who wants to love you. I don&#39;t know what will the future bring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;IF, and that is a very big IF, I would definitely consider it, but I will not bring him pain. I still don&#39;t know the extent of what he knew and when he knew it. My biggest sadness was he didn&#39;t trust me with the truth. Maybe he thought I would reject him without an explanation. But I don&#39;t want to give you or anyone for that matter false hope.&#34; He takes me in his arms and it feels so comforting and he whispers in my ear... &#34;Then I shall just hope, allow me at least that.&#34; I take in his scent that now that he isn&#39;t touching my belly smells of fresh grass. I feel dizzy and I allow him to just hold me for a while taking in his comfort and feel at peace... Even if it&#39;s just for a little while.</p>
