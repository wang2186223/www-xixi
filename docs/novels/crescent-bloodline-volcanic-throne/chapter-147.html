                <p>Marcus POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news channels have been going haywire all morning. We are all at the big Television room in the pack house looking as the world is in chaos because of what happened. The funny thing is the only casualty the humans are suffering from is from their own fear, not of them died, none of their property destroyed, they are terrified that an organization can pull off an attack like this in so many countries. People are going in and out of the pack house with new information to share. Many family members from other packs have been calling all morning... Most asking if we were going to move the pack and join The Osupa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everett came over... &#34;Good thing my source was in Washington DC, otherwise he would be dead! This is indeed a HEAVY blow to The Council! I don&#39;t even know if they&#39;ll be able to recover from this! It was truly unwise to attack The Osupa, they definitely don&#39;t fuck around!&#34; I still can&#39;t believe what they pulled off... Well after really being inside Loiza&#39;s mind I can imagine how much focus this took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got an incoming transmission from Jason, and everyone went to the comms room to listen in...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you guys seeing THIS?! Dude it was INTENSE! EVERYONE on the island partook! I STILL FEEL the surge of power man! Also I FOUND MY MATE!&#34; He will be given citizenship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, Jason what do you mean everyone partook?&#34; I ask. He explained how they did it without much detail, but I got the gist. By the Goddess! My own sources in the supernatural world report that every attack from The Council has stopped (yeah, no shit!) and that even The Elves have concluded that The Osupa were worthy adversaries and would be unwise to irk them... They have very much put an end to any plans anyone had to cross them or their allies (again, no shit!).</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you found your mate?! How?&#34; Leo asked him wanting details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dude I TOLD you! The moment I saw her I just KNEW she would be MINE! Brianna turned 18 today and I got to it and mated and Marked her immediately! I am officially Osupa man! I&#39;m in THEIR link now, Brianna turned 18 at midnight and the moment I Marked her I was IN so I was one of the pieces that helped with what happened! I have NEVER felt this and the mate Bond! It&#39;s insane! I&#39;m so glad we got a holiday today.&#34; Where&#39;s Kayden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason, Kayden went over with the Lady Moira to negotiate, have you seen him?&#34; What&#39;s happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen him but I did scent him earlier, so he IS here, also I overheard Shomari tell Haya that he has been all morning with the Cacique.&#34; Who?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, if he&#39;s been in there all morning that&#39;s a good thing... I guess we wait for him.&#34; Adam hasn&#39;t stopped watching the news, and now that he heard Jason gloat that not only he&#39;s a part of supernatural history now, because yeah... THIS is going to be studied, already there&#39;s debate weather Loiza is a butcher or the Avenging Angel of Death... But that he ALSO found his mate, has Adam cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Beta, the Lady Moira waits by the shrine. She wishes to speak with the pack do I escort her?&#39; Where&#39;s Kayden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Yeah, bring her up!&#39; I have been trying to figure out how best to approach her, I NEED to hit the books hard on Avalon Law!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a splendid though Beta.&#34; She was looking at the television showing split images of the destruction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lady I was hoping my brother would have returned with you.&#34; She looks at me with that blank face of hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Cacique and her mate are rekindling the Bond between The Osupa and Blood Moon. What does Blood Moon choose? To stay or be welcomed as new Osupa?&#34; Um? Everyone in the room was looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lady, is it ok if we assemble the pack so that you could give the terms as well as your opinion and take it to a vote?&#34; She looks around at everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Assemble away Beta, I shall wait.&#34; Thank you! I link Avis and Adam to round up the pack and take them to the assembly hall, while I escort the Priestess to the office and offer her anything. She only wanted water again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After gathering the whole pack, I escorted the Lady Moira so she can address them. Many had seen her before, dressed in pale yellow she was truly a sight to behold. The murmurs stopped the second she walked in the room and she lowered her hood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blood Moon... As you have seen all morning, The Osupa will protect their territory and avenge their dead with a very clear message and yet have the finesse to carry it out with the power of Avalon as backup. OUR world, is understanding that to choose to have animosity with The Osupa is CLEARLY a poor choice, so regardless, the supernatural world will not make a move against them, at least not now, we all know how this goes. The human world is in total chaos, we are trying to determine how long does human fear last, however it doesn&#39;t seem to end, so this chaos will endure until they calm down when they don&#39;t think they are in danger, yet well we know them to be unpredictable. Your Alpha has reconciled with The Osupa Queen and they wish for all of you to join them in Karaya. What is Blood Moon&#39;s choice? Remember, your Alpha could have left you to fend for yourselves, the Cacique had already forgiven him and she could have taken back her mate, yet he stayed to ensure your survival. They BOTH want you to.&#34; She placed the cards on the table except the conditions. She wants to know what they want. She comes to me on the way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beta I will wait by the shrine until they have made their choice. Also tell Alpha Everett to warn his man inside the Washington</p>
