                <p>chapter they occupy? I&#39;m talking not even leaving a trace for human forensic divisions.&#34; This has always been a Gambit she never wanted to play, looks like she doesn&#39;t care anymore. Bayoán and the others linked me what happened. I still have my sister&#39;s last voice mail on my phone, she sounded so happy... I can&#39;t erase it. My brother Vincente still has Mom&#39;s bracelet that she had the day before. She had taken off while having dinner, she would always do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Always Alpha!&#34; Gloria answers with a growing smile already understanding Izz&#39;s plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good! I want every single operative we have to prepare to perform a coordinated attack throughout the planet for a controlled implosion of EVERY single one of those buildings, I want the correct schematics so we don&#39;t hurt any single human building. There might be casualties but I want to keep it at a minimum. They already gathered the additional information we need so tell them to come back home once they&#39;re done we need to ensure no images of them be at the disposal of ANY of those countries. While The Council is dealing with the pandemonium of the attacks, we will extract Chandrama. We need those rogues attacking gone. Give me a plan to get them to the Sea these are over 7,000? Correct? I want The Council to bleed, I want them to be terrified of even hunting anyone that wants to ally themselves with us! I want them on the run!&#34; The room went silent... It reminded me of her with Chairman Tiago&#39;s daughters... I didn&#39;t think she would REALLY do anything and now looking back I think she WOULD have taken their hands. She hasn&#39;t dealt with her pain and as Alpha, she carries ALL of OUR collective pain too. Yet I felt it... WE ALL felt it! She was opening her link to SHOW us the pain she has been holding. The one we have been ALL holding... We take a collective breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence... We could only hear our own hearts pounding in our heads. Our memories of that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? You&#39;re not comfortable with my plan? Would you have felt uncomfortable if I would have been male? I am a werewolf! We are what nightmares are made of, we are the angels of death to those who dare even think of harming our people so if anybody has a problem with this plan I suggest you speak up now!&#34; We all exhale. Through the Link I feel that everyone is shocked by what she proposed, yet we are ALL remembering our pain, when we had to collect whatever remains were left of those we loved. Some started to hold hands, I felt Janaína&#39;s hand in mine... I looked at our matching aquamarine eyes. She wasn&#39;t Osupa when Mt. Cemí blew, yet she feels my pain and I feel hers for those lost in Brazil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were all holding each other in a way looking at the map and then General Braka roared waking us back to reality! He took a knee before Izz and we all followed. I am still running numbers holding Jana in my arms, she&#39;s backing my calculations. Shomari and Bayoán are playing all the scenarios and we are linking Gloria and Izzy our every assessment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It shall be as you command Cacique! At what time do you want to strike?!&#34; Braka asks, receiving all our data.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiles... &#34;That&#39;s simple... So that they KNOW it&#39;s US I want this melody to begin at EXACTLY 4:30 am OUR time!&#34; The time THEIR attack on us started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room explodes in massive howling! Gloria starts giving commands out to EVERY comm to contact our people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;General, is the First Regiment standing by?&#34; The First Regiment? When did she give THAT order?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As ordered Cacique!&#34; She lets us in her mind... In every single extraction her and Braka always had additional back up, however, since we had the back up of Avalon with Priestesses it was never needed. But THIS... This was VENGEANCE! This was personal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They wanted our wealth, they wanted our tech, they, like those who took our lands and HUNTED and ENSLAVED our ancestors centuries ago to near extinction, we will teach THEM THAT WE ARE OSUPA!!! We survived the colonizers! We survived The FUCKING Great War! We survived The Warewolf Council&#39;s treachery! FUCK SURVIVAL! We are the HUNTERS AGAIN and they are our DAMN PREY! Let this be a warning to the entire supernatural world! THE MINUTE YOU MAKE YOUR FIRST MOVE AGAINST US WILL BE YOUR ONLY MOVE!&#34; I looked at Bayoán... We felt it... The WHOLE island was awake! The Link was humming alive as the wings of a bumblebee in the hive. The entire pack was ready to HUNT, the natural instinct of our Primal animal alert and prowling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every operative was standing by preparing the explosives. We were already sending every single one of them an exit plan from the country they were at! The techs were hacking into every single satellite connection on the planet hacking into the system to erase any trace that remains of our people. We hacked into their own intelligence agencies through back doors they didn&#39;t even know they had. Stalking... The entire pack was feeling the natural instinct to stalk, feeding those in command to take the leap for the collective to feed off the pray!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see Izzy&#39;s eyes molten gold, she was running through every single scenario in harmony with Aryn! Damn she always looked sexy when she did that! Every time I would read her notes I knew she was going to be something amazing. Would I have been able to handle a mate like this? Can Kayden? If Gaia herself mated them it means HE can do this too, Izz only had an edge because of her education! The last time we were on a mission with Ura, Lola and Sammy, we all looked like KIDS as she would tell the stories of everything that we thought was a myth and legend. We would sit late into the night in front of the fire drinking whatever booze we had in hand and she always had the best weed, her voice alone was a spell! This is truly when we actually heard her voice, she used to be so silent... I send this message through our Beta Link. They all know what I had with Izzy, when we did synchronization training we completely synchronized ourselves and all of our minds were open to each other. It was pretty embarrassing with her brother! But still they were able to access a part of her that they never knew about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;We have to get them together at once! If this is successful it could either go really good or really bad and we have to be ready for that scenario. Having Blood Moon with us and them together could make a difference a very big one! I guess the Goddess didn&#39;t disappoint me after all! He is GRAND indeed it&#39;s just that he wasn&#39;t as educated as her, but I have a sense he&#39;s already accessed EVERYTHING. Look let&#39;s focus on THIS now we already know our next move after, now we have to solve the puzzle with her we are her backup!&#39; We are all in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We go to the map, each of us studying different parts of the globe and which operatives were already in place. We have to make sure that they had an exit plan, we are Osupa Warriors, we&#39;re trained that every single second is extremely valuable! It&#39;s always best to take the very minute you have the idea and move the collective just as it is with a Kappa, inspiration can leave at any moment. This is OUR art! And she was inspired by her pain to strike her brush stroke back as hard as possible! Each and every one of us is getting in tune with our own wolf. I had only read once about this! Kumo is with me! I can even feel the Saint Germaines feeling of shame but we&#39;re all willing to drop it to ensure the win of the main goal. The hive mind is in tune, all of our minds feeding our Alpha, her eyes shinning red with that new moon Mark in her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already every scenario for the pack in India to move out is in place, there will be a massive power outage... Obviously with the commotion that&#39;s going to be happening worldwide it&#39;s only going to be a glitch. And that&#39;s when we move the pack to the closest airport! Again we are using a worldwide terrorist event to take all of the attention away from us! That is OUR stealth! That&#39;s how we stay invisible! The other event will be global so a power outage in India with thousands of giant wolves will be dismissed as mass hysteria. We will ensure that there is no evidence we were ever there. We will become the loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, The Yeti. With the First Regiment there, there is enough people to fly the pack out!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks over at me and signals for me to go with the others to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you guys think? Do you see any glitch? I&#39;m running the numbers as best I can.&#34; Her numbers are actually on point she even has 2 minutes to spare! And now I see what Bayo meant of her having part of her mind think like a Beta. I don&#39;t know, from what I remember of her mind has ALWAYS been like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy you have 2 minutes to spare do you have anything that you want to add or is just leftover time?&#34; She looks thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, that&#39;s fine. I just wanted to double check. We have less than an hour!&#34; Her eyes are still gold fully focused that&#39;s how everyone&#39;s eyes must be right now, the color of their Wolf. We can even feel those who aren&#39;t wolves... We feel the mermaids alert, even the vampires. And it&#39;s Harmony!</p>
