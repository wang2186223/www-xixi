                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I locked my door and ordered to not be interrupted until morning. I was jetlagged and was anxiously waiting until midnight for them to get me to take me to her. I was just in jeans a white T-shirt and white sneakers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The portal opens and I cross already getting her scent, but there&#39;s something else. We weren&#39;t in Loiza&#39;s room, Víctor leaves while Bayoán kisses the pups&#39;s foreheads and gives me a warning look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious man?! These are MY pups!&#34; And Víctor returns and takes him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayoán, you and I will talk later, do you understand?&#34; Isla tells him without looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you say Luna!&#34; He responds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please forgive Bayoán, he&#39;s a lot like his father, he is very overprotective of his family. Enough of that, I brought you earlier so you could see them yourself. Also their scent on you will be good for her mood.&#34; I can&#39;t believe it! They&#39;re right in front of me! I pick up the girl and she&#39;s stunning, she is a little photo copy of her mother, down to her cupids bow and dimples. Her skin was so soft and it did have the pearlescent look, but you could barely see it in person. Luna Isla took her claw to her and told me to look. She scratched her, but her skin was unbroken!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now try with the boy.&#34; And I pick up my son, he already looks strong and alert. I take out a claw, and I&#39;m unsure about this... She takes my claw and puts pressure to his skin, but it took a lot to cut him, he cried a little but regenerated almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that they&#39;re the product of two Alphas, being born in water full of mermaids, Queen Pasha&#39;s Blessings... Or if you two started a new mutation, their skin is being cloned to experiment on it&#39;s features. Also...&#34; She shows me both of the inside of their left wrist and clear as day there&#39;s my new Mark. No wonder Izzy made such a fuss! Marks appear on her pups and sees it on me, duh she wants to know!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caliburn will never hurt them, no matter how long they hold it or get cut by him.&#34; I tell her. I take both of my babies, the girl looks like she&#39;s got a secret she&#39;ll never tell and he is so serious. I can&#39;t help myself and hold them tightly... Shit! I helped make these!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hands them to a woman to take them to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She produced milk all day and we were able to pump it and good too because she has slept all day! We made sure to leave her. This pass week she only slept 4 hours. So thank you, keep doing what you&#39;re doing, Come!&#34; We go to her room, she&#39;s sleeping like she&#39;s lounging, and has this lovely smile on her face. And she is as naked as I left her! They were taking the milk pumps out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s water and other things in the refrigerator, if you want anything else call me on your ring and it will connect you to me. Ok?&#34; I can make calls with the ring, too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Luna!&#34; She smiles and leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurry and go wake Izzy. I take off my sneakers and climb in bed and just rake her body with my eyes and just want to take little bites of her, I bite her ear, I bite her lip, I lick my Mark. And she&#39;s stirring, I touch all of her body and her nipples are rock hard just like me, I take little bites of those. I go lower and open her legs wide and give little bites and kisses inside her thighs, licks to her clit and of her core and I feel her hands on the back of my head encouraging for me to continue...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take off my shirt and go back to her pussy and her moans are making me harder. I feel from her end that she&#39;s recovering but still needs me to go easy on her body but hard enough to to fill her with pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I keep playing with her pussy going to my Mark and suckling it while putting one, two fingers inside her. And she rewards me with her moans and her hand is looking for my cock. I unbutton my jeans and throw them on the floor, and welcome her touch, she shifted her body towards me and the hand that found my cock traveled up slowly up my abs, my chest and found my face and lowered it to hers. We made out for a while, I never just made out with her, I loved this feeling, she was showing love, I loved feeling that she loved me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked in her eyes when I started playing with her pussy again, she looked at me with begging eyes, I kissed her temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what you want baby, let&#39;s charge you up a bit ok? I want you really wet and in need today. I want to see if what I read works.&#34; She looks doubtfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to experiment on me?&#34; She asks me with a hoarse raspy voice... Meh, maybe!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe, will you trust me?! Besides you had a spy in my pack, you owe me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s really wet now and her scent is even stronger and I enter her, again gently but then her need made mine escalate until we came and I sunk my canines on the bone right behind her ear and I felt it. As my canines punctured the bone it&#39;s if my marrow is being sucked out but I feel hers get stronger, I feel more pain than pleasure. Yesterday she would have been to weak for it, I was reading on ways of after birth recovery for females who were very weak, they recommend this. I let go and lie there catching air, I feel like I&#39;m about to pass out... I even think I did because I feel her getting something, I don&#39;t remember her getting up. She raises my head on her lap and gives me cold water and pours some on my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you better now? Kayden?!&#34; She sounds worried, I want to tell her I&#39;m fine. Isla comes in and I can tell Izz is explaining to her what happened, hey my Spanish is getting better!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the doctor comes in. Sure just leave me there naked! Oh Right, The Osupa don&#39;t really care about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s going to need to consume a lot of blood, I&#39;ll send something from the kitchens to help him recover the blood loss and a potion to help speed his regeneration. It must have been the first time he&#39;s done it this is only recommended in extreme circumstances if the female is VERY weak, some males become desperate to help their mates that they don&#39;t care about the risks to it. The good thing is it does help the female a lot but weakens the male... do you hear that Alpha, this could have killed you! Next time ask a doctor! But now that he&#39;s punched through the bone, it will be very easy to have access to it and transfer marrow, so the bone won&#39;t heal for at least a month Luna, it will remain this way to allow him to keep transferring marrow. We just have to keep giving HIM the meat that was not really helping the Cacique, she will get what she needs from him. I&#39;ll send for some morcilla, Alpha Kayden, how does that sound? Have you ever had blood sausage?&#34; I give a thumbs up, but I really could do with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They leave us alone and Izz gets a kimono from her closet and a robe for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby you couldn&#39;t have brought this before all those women came in here?&#34; And I hear her laughing, I can&#39;t contain my own smile. She comes and gets inside my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always forget what prudes outsiders are! You didn&#39;t have to do that Kayden, you experimented but the cost could have been too high!&#34; And Isla brings a tray with assortments from the kitchens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I did love and please don&#39;t say that again, remember I refuse to have a Block, so you feeling like this is killing me.&#34; She dodges her eyes from me. She goes to the tray and puts something in my mouth, it&#39;s a bit spicy, but the taste of the blood is heaven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You like it?&#34; More!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My love there isn&#39;t anything that your pack cooks that I don&#39;t like, more please.&#34; And her smile and how she looks right now made this totally worth it. &#34;Here, czernina, it&#39;s Polish and this is dinuguan, it&#39;s a pork blood stew and steamed rice cakes.&#34; It&#39;s 1:30 in the morning after I eat all of that... Oh yeah, and it was a wonderful bloody mess, I feel so much better. I have her in my arms, I already smell her need again but she&#39;s so still, I feel in the Bond she doesn&#39;t want me to hurt again, but I AM hurting not touching her, I wish she didn&#39;t have her Block so she could understand. So I have to be more creative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I untie her robe while kissing her Mark so to distract her a bit and rake my fingers down her body reaching her sweetest spot. Her moans are intoxicating, I put her on her stomach... as I am entering her I notice the markings and tattoo on her back. &#34;What are these love?&#34; I am gently trusting inside her, tracing them with my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell you later, I&#39;m not in the mood to talk about how everyone is turning me into a bathroom stall for their doodles! Just like that baby, keep hitting me right there! That speed is perfect! And LOOK!&#34; She shows me the inside of her left wrist. I climb on her so my chest has contact with her back, it feels really good, and I agree, this speed is perfect... I hold her wrist and trace the Mark with my thumb. I kiss her neck...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you all get it at the same time?&#34; I am trying to focus but she is snaking herself under me making me push into her harder and faster turning her soft moans into screams in to her pillow, I can&#39;t take it, I come in her and again punch my canines in to her bone. This time I only feel a bit dizzy, but I catch my bearings and I&#39;m fine, just REALLY tired. I unmount her and lie there with her wrist at my lips, my other hand caressing that thick ass I love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got her breath... &#34;Yeah, we did. Did you figure out what it means?&#34; Shit. I let go of her smooth ass and put my arm over my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet love, c&#39;mon I was finding how to do my part for you and the pups...&#34; She wraps her arms around my neck and puts a leg over me, making me put my arm on it. She kisses my lips...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I appreciate it.&#34; She takes my hand and exposes the Mark. &#34;Baby, this means Earth, look at my ankle.&#34; And there&#39;s another tattoo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn babe! How many do you have?&#34; She shakes it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not the point, look inside, right in the middle.&#34; And there it is. The same symbol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Earth... what about the ones on your back?&#34; She tells me about the things that have happened, she even tells me that there&#39;s things she can&#39;t even share with her Betas, with me or anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will only be able to share it with the pups when the time is right, I don&#39;t know who gets to rule and Jade is only like three minutes younger than Deacon.&#34; WHAT?!</p>
