                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The packs from Uruguay and Brazil were welcomed as the others were. They were very impressed with the tactics we used, so their Alphas Diego and Federico, Betas and other Warriors wanted to be trained at once. They arrived almost at the end of the Solstice festivities but they didn&#39;t need to be pushed AT ALL to join in!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was summer were they were, not that we really are touched by winter per se, but their cultures and customs are VERY similar to our own. They added Candombé, Batucada, Samba, they took to the streets with shows of Milonga and Tango and so many rich flavors! They were tired of just surviving and wanted to LIVE and wanted to start immediately! For us it was refreshing to be with people with as much energy as our own and they joined in with our flavors of Salsa and Merengue, Mambo and Trova, Bomba and Plena, Rara and Bachata, among so many others. They helped complement us and were curious of the music and customs of the others and helped us bring them out of their remaining shyness. The packs from Afghanistan, France, Sardinia, Senegal and The Gambia now definitely wanted to shine!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samira had Jalebi dancers and the sounds of the zerbaghali added to the flavor of the food. And the plazas in downtown Itiba and Atabex would fill up with Kappas with every instrument from the mandolins, accordions and fiddles to the sabars and the tama drums. The news outlets were interviewing all and asking questions about their regions, music, food, language and dance styles. This was something I did appreciate, it helped everyone learn about THEIR own new brothers and sisters. The media also talked with the mermaids and this helped spread their own particular culture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone of different ranks from Alphas to Omegas were receiving education on their particular strengths and the opportunities that came for them and the pack by feeding into those strengths. Nina was exited by the Kappas from Brazil, the city that she wants to start building ASAP in the mountains in the Caney District, was already given founding and she was working with them on the challenges of building there and surrounding rainforest. She and other architects were very interested in building a city very similar to Brasilia. I asked her to make sure to make something nice for the shores of Caney Lake so that the mermaids could swim up river there and hang out which will help feed the economy of that city. We were now a multicultural, multi species pack of over 30,000! Ayana said that many fae hybrids wanted to come as well as a big group of Brownies and others of mainly the Unseelie Court. I had her and Phoebe start drawing up a VERY STRICT treaty, with the big inclusion of no changeling funny business as well as a no tricks for regular words and gestures like for example saying thank you. It also had to include basically the same terms as the mermaids of no mind tricks and such. They definitely had their work cut out for them. With the fae you have to be VERY specific.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayoán was going insane with the amount of work he now had. So I decided to go into uncharted territory and called Víctor to my office, he may be the asshole he is but he IS a VERY capable Beta and he and Bayoán got along and had worked very well together when Bayoán was a field op. I didn&#39;t know how to approach this... I hate his guts right now, but I KNOW him and can&#39;t think of anyone better, so I swallow my pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took some guava juice with 4 drops of Tunu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha?&#34; The 6&#39;6&#34; tall wall of muscle, with tan skin, very dark auburn hair and hazel eyes gave a knock at my door. Sigh... Maybe this is a mistake, but my intuition is pushing hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Víctor, please come in, take a seat!&#34; He sat in front of me with a questioning look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Víctor I want to congratulate you on how you handled the situation in Uruguay. And to that goes my first question because depending on that answer will give me an idea of the offer I want to propose to you. The least I want to do is waste anyone&#39;s time especially my own, you know how I am about that. Fair enough?&#34; Always have a plan B! If he didn&#39;t want to be Beta, he was to be given a team to extract packs who needed assistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s how you know I like it Alpha, no need for needless chit chat.&#34; Indeed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Víctor, you have been in the field for a long time, do you prefer to stay there or would you like to take a break from that and stay home?&#34; And suddenly I notice that he gives a slight blush. What in Hades was this?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Alpha, um...&#34; Ok, this was WEIRD behavior coming from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For Goddess sake Víctor I&#39;m not proposing matrimony, spit it out! It&#39;s not like we are strangers, I still remember fondly the time I gave you a right kick to the balls for being such a charmer and you calling me a stupid cunt that should sleep with one eye open in the mission in Honduras. Funny shit!&#34; He actually chuckled and rubbed his face smiling and blushing more. Ok now I was nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, good times! And now you are The Alpha not The Raven.&#34; Ooookaaay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Víctor I thought we said no needless chit chat, spit it out! You want to go back out or stay home? Speak your mind or I will order you to!&#34; Him acting like this was unsettling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! I found my mate among the pack from Uruguay and want to stay home to be with her!&#34; And I can&#39;t help but laugh! So that&#39;s why he&#39;s acting like this! And no wonder he was so patient with them, he wanted her to be happy and bring her pack, and duh! His scent is different! Stupid fog!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn, I should have kept it to myself!&#34; Oh no you don&#39;t!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Víctor don&#39;t be an idiot! If you want to stay home I will inform Gloria of it, there is no problem. I just wanted to offer you a job! Which I may add has lots of perks which is always a plus at giving mates a good impression!&#34; At this he did show interest. So far so good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A job Alpha?&#34; Crossing fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you clearly have noticed Víctor we have tripled our numbers after the... Incident, which I wish to extend my condolences for the loss of your mother and sister, they were amazing women and Warriors.&#34; He gave a sad smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, and you as well Alpha, your mother was a respected instructor and your father... Well Beta Ayato shall have no equal.&#34; Here we go... He was calling Dad so formally! Not that they were familiar... It&#39;s just that he disagreed a LOT with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He may or may not, I miss him but sadly his time has passed, which brings me to my job offer. Like I said, our numbers are tripled those we had before and Beta Bayoán&#39;s work load with it, I wish for you to be Karaya&#39;s second Beta. You both will have the same rank and standing, you will work as a team as you two have done so well in the past...&#34; As WE did so well in the past... &#34;As Beta you will sit in on my Council and be privy to sensitive information, as well as having apartments here at The Fort. I would prefer you both share the large office in the East Wing were you would be able to brainstorm together, but that would be up to both of you to decide. You know me well enough to know I won&#39;t bitch about how you would prefer to work, so what do say Víctor?&#34; He looks shocked, what is his mate doing to him?! He&#39;s showing emotions! Like... On his FACE! It&#39;s scary!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious? You want me to be Beta?&#34; Um?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Víctor if you don&#39;t want to, it&#39;s absolutely fine! I won&#39;t take offense, I am offering because even though you are, well YOU! I KNOW that your skill and capacity for calculating and assessment are top notch, I KNOW that your loyalty is unquestionable and your dedication to the pack is impecable. If you don&#39;t want the jo--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I accept Cacique! I swear to the Goddess I will not fail the standards you have shown so far. It would be my honor to serve as Beta to you, side by side with Beta Bayoán!&#34; And now I don&#39;t know how I feel about this but my intuition is not letting this go. Move on Izz! Shit, that&#39;s how he always called me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awesome! Then follow me!&#34; I link Bayo to make sure he&#39;s in his office and sure enough. &#39;Where ELSE am I going to be?!&#39; I am going to have the most charming Betas any Alpha could wish for!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get to Bayoán&#39;s office with Víctor and he already knows he accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok you two, you know the drill so stand together and allow me to focus on BOTH of you as one unit, got it?.&#34; Bayoán stands up and walks forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Goddesses Izzy just do it already! If I get home late one more day Morgana&#39;s going to take all the air out of my lungs!&#34; Víctor looks at him like he&#39;s having second thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shut up and let me focus I have to calculate my words to the T! Now stand side by side and focus on my words and keep your links open and in sync with mine.&#34; They&#39;re still and focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I, Loiza Mirabal, Alpha of The Osupa Pack and Cacique of the Hallowed grounds of Karaya Island, name you Bayoán Mirabal, Beta of our tribe and you Víctor del Valle, Commander Field Operator and First Gun of the Osupa Pack Intelligence Agency, to the rank of Betas of our tribe, to work in unity. Blessed Be.&#34; And suddenly the same Mark with the Greek B for Beta burns at Víctor&#39;s right wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHOA! THE FUCK?!&#34; He he! Bayoán shows him his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you kidding me?! For two big though guys like you, you act like big babies! Here I am about to pop and looking like a bulletin board and you don&#39;t hear me bitching about it! Ok, now how are you both feeling? Are your brain waves syncing?&#34; They both close their eyes and they move as if REM sleep. Víctor should be feeling the power surge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa!&#34; Víctor says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know right?&#34; Bayoán answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both open their eyes at the same time and their colors have changed to aquamarine blue! Ok did I miscalculate something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, guys...&#34; I start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn! I feel amazing! I&#39;m calculating a mile a minute! And my nose! I can smell the people by the Fortaleza Beach!&#34; And he looks out the window. &#34;I can see all the way to Karayita CLEARLY! I feel like I could swim all the way to it in less than half the time I used to!&#34; Bayoán gives this smug face, like he knows. I get my little mirror from my pocket. And hand it to smug face! My forehead Mark has already assured me everything was done to perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guys, BOTH of you have gone through a change, so take that stupid smile from your face Dumbo!&#34; Bayo looks at himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHOA! Izzy what did you do?!&#34; I smile. And Víctor looks at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey nice eyes dude!&#34; And Bayo hands him the mirror. And Víctor looks and almost drops it! This is too funny!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at both of you looking so pretty with your new baby blues! You two should get matching suits and everything!&#34; And they look at me at the same time. Yup they&#39;re in sync.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to us?!&#34; They both ask at the exact time and I start laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry! So your eyes changed color, they look really nice! Look everything is as it should, the Goddess has given you both a Blessing now learn to adapt to it, I bet even you&#39;re feeling stronger than before Bayo... Am I wrong?&#34; He recalibrates and he feels it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do! How is this possible?&#34; He now goes to the window to see if Víctor was exaggerating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, the Mark on your forehead is glowing--&#34; Víctor starts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Green? Yeah, I have friends in high places. That B Mark for Beta is a Blessing from Selene, those aqua eyes are yours courtesy of the Great Mother Gaia, so remember that you serve THEM as much as you serve me! Now Bayo I already have informed most of the basics to Víctor. But you both should be feeling quite connected and as you share a Bond with me, you should already feel a strong one to each other. Now I shall leave you alone so you can get acquainted with your new Bond and Bayo you&#39;re welcome! I just cut your work load by half! Víctor choose the apartment that you want and I hope you and your mate enjoy the perks of living at The Fort! Your welcome, too!&#34; Now for some lunch!</p>
