                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have a bad feeling...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today is my 20th birthday, everything is quiet, too quiet. I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m Alpha, Cacique, Queen, Priestess, Freak, etc. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m having a party! When we were a little younger Suania used to say that I was completely insane for hating them... Dad always respected it and I know he made sure Mami didn&#39;t make a fuss. We did negotiate a cake and the wish... But singing? A party? No way! I only accepted my Quinceañera reluctantly because I still was barely talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sad reality is Mami had prepared a surprise birthday party for me last year. She knew I was feeling unhappy, I didn&#39;t tell her it was because disappointment of when I turned 18 and not getting Víctor... Not even Casi... I walked out of it and didn&#39;t come back for two days. I know I hurt her but I was pissed, she KNOWS I hate these, how could she even think this would cheer me up?! I felt humiliated and I guess she did too, but we never talked about it. Like it never happened. I wish I could argue with her now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We never celebrated our birthday in Avalon, we had a ceremony at midnight and a Blessing for the day and that was that. The only thing that I craved on my birthday was to just be with Cressy and Ayana and have an adventure, since it was my only request, Moira always approved it and all three of us were relieved of our chores and duties for the day. That&#39;s how we got our affinity for Unicorns! Neither of us could shift so it&#39;s not like we could run really wild, when I turned 6 we had already established our little pack, all the girls had their own little group. We all work together regardless but we still have our own more intimate circle. So that year we just went exploring the island of Avalon... It&#39;s big and not easy terrain, we were determined to find something of real fun. After hours of walking, climbing, running, scratches, tiredness and just frustration we decided to head back but Ayana kept looking East.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s do that hill guys, if there&#39;s nothing we bail, ok?&#34; We were already fed up but she looked so convinced about something and her hearing is way better than Cressy&#39;s and mine. So we thought she had a hunch. And boy was it worth it! There are unicorns all over Avalon, you might see one maybe two a week if you were lucky... But THIS! It was a field FULL of them, hundreds! We approached carefully not wanting to startle them, but we were female maids and they could tell we were children. They allowed us to climb on them and they indulged us and they ran wild! From that day the other two asked the same request for their birthday, so for three days every year we would ride unicorns on our birthday. Those were the happiest memories of my childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had our first official Council meeting today. The Betas except for Víctor who&#39;s on leave, General Braka, the Lady Yaya, Admiral Casimar, Lord Orwell, Luna Isla, Ex-Director Ayiti, Director Gloria, the Lady Phoebe and Elder Orocobix Guerrero-Real (he was my mother&#39;s mentor and she trusted his judgment, I knew we was reasonable and he had been mentor to other Alphas in the past, there is no way I was going to have Elder Guillermo who mentored Guarionex, he was always a backwards quack) I can already imagine his indignation... Made me smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you listening Cacique?&#34; Bayoán asks calmly but I know the pitch of his voice so well I could hear his annoyance. It made me smile more. The Council chamber behind the Throne room had the same design in a way from the latter so the acoustics were perfect. With the exception of me welcoming them they started yapping immediately throwing a thousand things at me! So I decided to stay silent until they decided to vent whatever they had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could I not Beta?! The acoustics in these chambers are quite good and you&#39;re all speaking so loudly. I think everyone here has good hearing, so instead of chuckling like a ton of hens can you all give me items one by one so we can actually solve them? Seriously! Is this how business was conducted before with Alpha Guarionex? Because if that&#39;s the case we&#39;re lucky so many of us survived at all! So know your place Beta and put your shit together! Now, would you all like to try that again?&#34; This is an Official meeting and as Dad&#39;s apprentice I know Bayo had attended these meetings before so he should know better. He also spoke with an inappropriate tone, in a place such as this and with the people present that was out of bounds. I may not have been Dad&#39;s apprentice with regards to this, but when I did go hunting with Mami she would give me the inner scoop... What for? Gossip? I don&#39;t know but since I do have the information I intend to use it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Very good, remember to exhale.&#39; I heard Elder Orocobix, I didn&#39;t look his way but I exhaled slowly. I hate politics...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless, I had just set the tone of how every meeting will be conducted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Queen forgive us, let&#39;s start again. Did you read the report related to my vision?&#34; Phoebe had not spoken. Neither she nor Orwell went on a rant. How fucking embarrassing the two non wolves are the ones with manners!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you My Lady. I did. I must admit this was quite disturbing, is this truly an order? Are the security measures in place not enough? And a deity? I don&#39;t remember offending any, I thought my Priestess Mark alone shielded me from those.&#34; I was actually thinking about getting something fun and non pack related since I was already all doodled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beta Bayoán spoke directly with the Lady Moira and she confirmed it.&#34; I nod and look at my brother with a look of: &#39;Watch your step asshole, I&#39;m not your little sister here!&#39; and I passed the sentiment though my link with the Betas so they don&#39;t forget their place. We can joke around outside, HERE I expect more. I felt their collective gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beta Bayoán, what does the Lady Moira recommend? Does she have any theories on to why this vision occurred? And which deity is so offended by me?&#34; You see bro? Civility. He looked like I just shook him and instead of the childish behavior he displayed earlier, I am giving him a pleasant smile and waiting patiently for him to get his bearings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cacique, the Lady Moira is collecting information and has requested an audience with Selene. However she recommends taking the vision seriously and to indeed get the tattoos. We have the schematics and measurements needed as well as each and every single rune. I have both Oller Masters working on the stencils.&#34; I breathe deep, my arms are all marked up, why the fuck not?! But... I haven&#39;t offended any deity. Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess there&#39;s no reason to discuss this item anymore then, tell the Masters to be ready by tomorrow, there is no reason for delaying this. If one of the Goddesses sent it, whether be as an order or as a warning we should always make heed. And if simple tattoos will bring security to our people and unwanted attention from whatever is out there it&#39;s a very small price. What is the next item?&#34; Since shutting Bayo up, the others show hesitancy. Phoebe did perfectly, can&#39;t they take her cue?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since no one speaks I have something my Queen.&#34; Orwell interjects. Ugh! The non wolves are taking them to school. Was it really that kind of chaos with my Uncle? I refuse to believe my Dad would allow a meeting be conducted that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you My Lord, please speak your mind.&#34; As non wolves I wanted to make sure that the pack understood their place of respect and hierarchy, so I granted Phoebe and Orwell titles of Lord and Lady. He passed around two files to everyone. Upon inspection it&#39;s the witch coven Morgana spoke of in New Orleans and I glance at Bayo but he seems out of the loop, I verify the report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lutherus, Roland, Gael, Mu Ten, Aurelia and myself have been watching the coven the Lady Morgana said reached out to move here. We have found no anomalies they&#39;re actually quite helpful to the supernatural world.&#34; This did pique my interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How so My Lord?&#34; He explained how they cast hiding spells for creatures so they can&#39;t be found by human hunters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They do practice some darker magic, they are Voodoo witches after all, they have worship for Selene but they also are allied to Yoruba deities.&#34; I inspect his report again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We hold high esteem towards the Yoruba deities and the prime Orishas in Karaya, there are still shrines for some around the island and even our own Beta Bayoán is a fervent follower of Changó even making it his code name. There&#39;s no conflict between Karaya Island and The Orishas, their worship is welcomed here. With that in mind what is yours and the other vampires opinion on welcoming this coven?&#34; He looked thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess it makes it simple then, we were just concerned about their gods, especially because of the order issued by the Goddess for the tattoos. However you say that The Osupa also hold worship for The Orishas I guess then we found no foul play with their intentions, they are just as those looking for sanctuary.&#34; Then what would happen to their work?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lord, I do have a question, why would a coven of witches dedicated to the worship of not only the Goddess but the Orishas, be looking for sanctuary? Did they offend anyone?&#34; Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Queen, you have been working at top stress. Maybe you haven&#39;t been informed?&#34; I look at Gloria, what the fuck is going on?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director, is there something you must tell me?&#34; I look at Tía Ayiti and she&#39;s got no clue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cacique, The Betas and OPIA are of the opinion---&#34; Ugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t ask for an opinion, I asked for a fact. Cut the shit and spill it! That&#39;s an order!&#34; All the time I&#39;m actually looking at Bayoán and he lowers his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The witches are at war Alpha.&#34; WHAT?! I am livid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see no point in continuing this meeting. Clearly many of you are unprepared and undisciplined. We will meet again in three days, I want a full report on this conflict, the parties involved and how all this began. I already read the report on the India extraction and I didn&#39;t see the proposal from the Saint Germaines, I won&#39;t move forward without it. If anyone has a beef with the them I suggest that peace be made and that bullshit be done with, we are Osupa, the pack is ALWAYS first, I will not stand by pride and pettiness. Ex-Director I recommend that you help Director Gloria, your pupil, and explain that keeping such important matter from her Alpha is akin to treason. We can have 20 Betas... They don&#39;t have the authority of keeping information from their Alpha. I can accept and overlook many things, but the price for treason is death! I truly hope this dress rehearsal has made you all understand what I expect from you in the future. I am not Alpha Guarionex nor do I care how he conducted his Council in his time, I expect excellence from you, if you can&#39;t give it to me I will find someone who can. Lord Orwell we shall talk about this other file at that time is that ok?&#34; I don&#39;t want to look at any of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you command my Queen.&#34; I need out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, this meeting is now adjourned, we will reconvene in 3 days I hope everyone is better prepared by then. And fair warning, if I get so much as a sniff that anything said here leaves these chambers make sure to get your pack transfer paperwork, any chismoso will be banished! Again, I don&#39;t give a shit anymore on how my uncle ran this show, I&#39;M the one running it NOW so focus on pleasing ME! Good day, I leave you to talk behind my back in peace!&#34; I take my documents and exit without sparing them a single glance. They are going to have to understand that I can joke around and am Izzy every day, yet I have always been someone who takes my duties seriously and the circus displayed was a joke that I would not tolerate ever again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to my office, I wasn&#39;t able to read Orwell&#39;s other report and want to see what it&#39;s about and link for coffee from the kitchen. As I start reading I can scent Elder Orocobix at the door, I raise my head with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How may I help you Elder? Please sit, I just ordered coffee, would you like some?&#34; He just gave a soft chuckle as he sat he crossed his legs and stared at me. Oooookaaaay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elder?&#34; His light brown eyes hone in to a picture of my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It should have been her... She would have silenced those &#39;chuckling hens&#39; as you said a generation ago and you wouldn&#39;t have been dealing with this now.&#34; The bitterness in his voice is palpable. I put down the report and sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elder we don&#39;t know how it would have played out either way and there&#39;s no point on thinking of it. It&#39;s on my head now and I will manage it as I see fit.&#34; He sits back on his chair with crossed arms, his own Alpha blood oozing calm and mature dominance, I imagine he must have been a very alluring man in his prime, just his own features and curly brown hair with salt and pepper trimmings gave him have that handsome mature professor look. Despite his age he is very handsome who takes care of himself and his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I accept.&#34; What now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elder?&#34; He gives me a dashing grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will mentor you as I did your mother, retirement isn&#39;t to my taste anyhow. I have been watching you very closely since we were in Blood Moon and you sequestered all of the Elders under suspicion of treason. You weren&#39;t even Alpha then... That was a very bold move risking the anger of the Elders, we need more of that.&#34; I recline on my own chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I&#39;ve been doing so well why do you consider I need a mentor at all? I don&#39;t think you would be able to comprehend the magnitude of the things I have been ordered to have done before one of my children takes my place. Elder I invited you to this meeting today strictly as a courtesy, everything I know about being an Alpha I know from my mother and since you helped train her hence the invitation. I guess I needed an unbiased opinion and you just gave it to me. So tell me again why is it I need you? As you can see I have enough advisors and they&#39;re all driving me crazy why would I add more salt to the wound?&#34; His roaring laugh jolted me up, for fucks sake!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ARE your mother&#39;s daughter! Why would Director Gloria obey The Betas more specifically, your brother?&#34; I&#39;m so tired of this...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My brother was going to be the next Beta of the tribe with previous military experience, while I was was just a Gamma Priestess with more experience in the field rather than High Command with a gentle title of Lady... I am not surprised that many people in this pack still see me that way, we always adhere mostly to the old ways and I&#39;m very sure that the fact that my brother, who people had already accepted would be their Beta to lead, should have more authority. Is my theory far off?&#34; He looked stunned. My gentle smile remaining after catching my bearings from his laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly was giving a thoughtful frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you analyzing as a Beta?&#34; Ummm...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I was named Alpha I had no Beta, it took more than expected for Bayoán to step up so my own brain picked up the slack.&#34; I COULD always use an experienced Alpha to give me some insight... I could really use my mother, even Grandfather was gone. I was in Avalon when he passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does Dr. Daniella know about this?&#34; Shit! I just noticed I said too much. No one can be MADE a Beta, you either are one or not, what I did is an anomaly and many wolves are very superstitious. Bayoán and just a few know but I never followed up with it. I stand up signaling the end of the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elder, thank you for your concern, but my health is in top shape, it was a pleasure speaking with you---&#34; He stands up and starts walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need for that Alpha, this old man won&#39;t pester you anymore today. I&#39;ll be back for the next meeting, after that you will tell me the whole puzzle, my job will be to make sure all your obstacles are clear I will accept your invitation for coffee then. Good day Cacique and Happy Birthday!&#34; He just waved with his back to me! How did he know? Has it been made public?</p>
