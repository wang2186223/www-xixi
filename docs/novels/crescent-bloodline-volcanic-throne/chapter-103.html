                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel like the dill hole who goes out with the smart chick, so that I don&#39;t have to do anything at school! No wonder they think we&#39;re a bunch of fucking cry babies. I didn&#39;t have to work to hard getting to see this, but for me to know all this information she made sure I looked for the right things. It wasn&#39;t hard, but I had to do it by myself, she turned it into a little puzzle. If I would have been what my father was to my mother I would be by her side right now, I would have held my pups as they were born, I would have been there to give her the prenatal care she needed yet, I STILL can give her post natal care! I have to claim her again after birth giving her body the boost I know that a female needs from her mate at such a time. She must have filmed this last night, the pups are just a week old, it was my duty to help her and continue to love and claim her every day to boost her body to produce more milk, no wonder she smelled different, she&#39;s breastfeeding. It makes me want to take their fucking heads again. Maybe we could negotiate for me do my postnatal duties to her, I hope Jason gets to call right away. I tried to link him but there&#39;s no way. I had Marcus wake me when we flew over The Caribbean, maybe we could try linking him there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Deacon, we have a lot of training to do.&#39; &#39;I know.&#39; He sounds so solemn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden, wake up man we are lowering our height, we&#39;re going over The Caribbean.&#34; I wake up immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want everyone to link Jason now!&#34; After half an hour Leo was able to link him and give my message about meeting with Loiza, this is a long shot, but I didn&#39;t like how I saw her in that recording. They gave us coordinates of somewhere to land. It was a desolate island with a runway, nothing else. I told everyone to leave me to talk with them alone, but it was Bayoán, that guy Víctor and Luna Isla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Kayden, so nice to see you again, so SOON...&#34; Bayoán started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough Bayoán! Alpha what matter exactly would you be referring to as your duty to Izzy?&#34; Apparently Loiza has left Isla as official Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That which must be done after, to care for her wellbeing, I saw how she looked Luna, is she like that every night?!&#34; Víctor looked at Bayoán who cut the smirk and looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was checking if you did get to that part Alpha... She&#39;s not well. She is producing less milk by the day, she sleeps less. We have already talked about a Wet Nurse, but that is stressing her more!&#34; Shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna I am willing to come to her for a few hours every night, no one has to know. I will make sure she&#39;s taken care of, I will claim her every time and give her anything she needs.&#34; She nods to Bayoán.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t know yet, two hours every night for her to regain her strength lover boy. We will bring you back in two hours, then you can fly away home and we will get you every night at midnight Cinderella, you can&#39;t leave her room unless it&#39;s by her command.&#34; How bad is she if Bayoán, blue eye edition, is totally ok with this. I link Marcus and tell them to wait for me. &#39;Are you serious?! We&#39;re in the middle of nowhere!&#39; &#39;Marcus I fucking order all of you to wait for me!&#39; I see him raise his arms in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me to her.&#34; Luna Isla signals me to follow her through a portal. And we are in long hall outside closed double dark wood doors next to us, Víctor and Bayoán leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll come for you later, listen Kayden, she needs this desperately, this is a very difficult time for a mate less female. She needs your care I didn&#39;t think you would think on it.&#34; Wait...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t you think I would think it? And she&#39;s not mate less! She&#39;s MY mate and I don&#39;t have a Block, I knew she was in pain, I just didn&#39;t know why.&#34; And she gives me a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry mijo, I misjudged you, just so you know every room is soundproof, come!&#34; She opens the door and there is only light coming from the balcony, this room is massive! We reach the balcony and she is sitting there with a blunt and a glass of wine. She shakes her head a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mija, I brought something that you need.&#34; She doesn&#39;t even look up, just covers her nose. She looks like a dish with her black satin camise and shorts in front of the fire. I can hear the roar of the ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it that nice Rioja I wanted?&#34; Isla just goes to the door, gives me a knowing smile and leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caress her cheek and I feel the goosebumps and the lightning, and so did she. I walked over to the edge, even the balcony is a huge half dome with a half roof! I check out how much of the famous Karaya Island do I get to see. Not much, not in darkness, but I see exactly what I want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this a castle or something?&#34; Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or something...&#34; I can&#39;t help but smile that she isn&#39;t kicking me out. I turn around and she&#39;s offering me the blunt. But she looks beat and today mustn&#39;t have been a walk in the park, although she sure made it look like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You found my hang out spot Alpha Black! Would you like to sit?&#34; I certainly park myself right next to her. Blow out and put it down, there&#39;s just one thing I want, my body is reacting to the knowledge of the pups and I can smell them on her, they smell well taken cared for. Will I get to see them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their mother is another thing. I can smell the lack of some nutrients she needs and my body is reacting to give it to her. I feel hers giving in. I wrap my arms around her waist placing her on top of me while I grind into her. Her scent was driving me crazy, but I couldn&#39;t pin point what it was, I had never had a pregnant mate before. Her scent now doesn&#39;t let me think, it&#39;s just telling my body what she needs and she needs me on top and inside of her badly. I carried her bridal style into the bedroom and I placed her on the bed and took my jacket and tie off. I kissed her Mark, getting more goosebumps and hard nipples I started caressing from under the fabric. I took that off and again I feasted on her beauty. I unbutton my shirt while I just watched her watching me. She was so still, as if patiently waiting with her eyes full of her soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes following my every move and the scent of her need was making me go faster. I take her bottoms off, she was a small puddle already. She was whimpering at this point, fuck it I will give her what she wants now and right now she really needs a good fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright baby, I know you&#39;re in pain.&#34; I kiss her forehead, her lips, her neck. &#34;It&#39;s been painful without you, too my beautiful mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go in gently and fuck, she&#39;s as tight as before and her whimpers turn to tears and moans, she holds tightly to me. And I start trusting harder and faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t stop Kayden. It hurts so much!&#34; And my beautiful mate is in tears, shit, I should have been here! I kiss them and I feel her reaching her orgasm I speed up to catch up to her and just as I spill myself inside her I bite down on my Mark and I&#39;m in heaven, I can feel through the Bond she is recovering and her body is taking from mine what it needs. We lie there for a moment until I felt she got what she needed and glad I wasn&#39;t to tired to give it to her. I retract my canines and get to task of cleaning it so it heals nicely again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay next to her spooning her on one elbow and caressing her waist, her hips, her thighs. We didn&#39;t have to talk, I could feel how tired she was, how she&#39;s falling asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey code name Raven, let&#39;s get you cleaned up ok? C&#39;mon sweetheart.&#34; I pick her up and I try to guess which door is the bathroom. She chuckles and points to the one the left, there were three!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Goddess, it&#39;s bigger than the room! How&#39;s it you don&#39;t get lost in here?&#34; She has this lazy smile but her complexion looks better. I sit her on a spa type bench, she is just smiling and watching me like before. I can&#39;t help but kiss her lips. I finally figured out how the shower worked and she got a long stick for her hair and put it up, she is so beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon love, no wet hair, got it!&#34; I cleaned us both. This shower has where to sit. If this is just HER rooms, I wanted to check this place out. But I made a deal and I am getting to be with her for a little while and make sure she&#39;s ok to take care of the pups. I will work on making this permanent, but I don&#39;t want her next recording to give me nightmares of her withering away. I laid her down and I spooned her again, her head lying on my bicep and my arm holding her close to me and she fell asleep, I stayed there looking at her sleep I wanted to join her but I knew my time was up. I kissed her telling her I would be back tomorrow and started getting dressed and no sooner did I got my tie...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon lover boy it&#39;s time to get you back.&#34; Víctor calls me while Luna Isla and Bayoán go to Loiza.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I follow Víctor... &#34;So, you&#39;re Loiza&#39;s second Beta? Apparently she&#39;s going to need a third soon.&#34; He stops and turns around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At the rate we&#39;re going, yeah very likely. If the Alpha told you something it&#39;s her prerogative to do so, but keep it to yourself. That woman in there has been a pain in my ass for a good chunk of my life! But see here&#39;s the thing about our pack, two people might not like each other very much, but there is something that moves every single link and that is duty and honor to your people. And if there is something I respect and admire greatly from our Alpha is that she takes on her duty without bitching about it. Dude on THIS island your mate has loyalty and respect from her people, of those who like her and those who don&#39;t, loyalty means EVERYTHING to us! I have a mate and I can imagine what you&#39;re going through and because of that sympathy for HER, her decaying condition and the insistence of The Luna is why this is being allowed. No one on this island would hurt or betray your pups man, for now I do my job and you do yours. I know that your not just focused about getting in her pants, she&#39;s your mate, she&#39;s already given you two pups and US two heirs. But I know she hopes to present you to everyone, but you have to get your shit together... If it would have been your pups lives on the line today, would YOU have trusted your people to take care of them or US? Now C&#39;mon, I want to get back to my own sweet mate! Hasta luego Goldilocks.&#34; And a Priestess opens a portal back to where the others were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the hell did you go?! Why are we HERE?&#34; Yeah, I totally ditched them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look I just wanted to make sure Jason was fine, ok? And he is, so let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the ring? Will it help us be more like them Boss? I have to say, it was kinda embarrassing to know YOUR the package you see elite teams in movies protect.&#34; Adam has always been prideful of being a strong Gamma, yet he loves those types of movies, so I can only laugh at his disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah it&#39;s full of instructions, but we can&#39;t ignore what we saw. They are the best because they train without complaints, we have to step up our game even more, remember guys, we are under the jurisdiction of Avalon now, we count on their protection and support, but we still don&#39;t know what that entails. Let&#39;s go home and prep a new training schedule in the morning, in the meantime call home and tell them to have raw steaks waiting for me.&#34; I have a mate and pups to care for.</p>
