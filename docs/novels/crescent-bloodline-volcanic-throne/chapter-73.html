                <p>&#34;Sumayah, I feel like myself again, go ahead and be with your family before you take your duties at the Eastern Temple I have already had it cleaned and updated and it has the most beautiful sun rises on the island.&#34; She has stayed ever vigilant of my progress, but besides my regular pregnancy hormones I feel fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Alpha, if you allow, my family would like to honor you with a traditional dinner of our people, my sister and her sister in law are gifted Kappas. Please allow us to thank you.&#34; The last time I had Middle Eastern food prepared by Kappas was in a short time I spent in Karachi a few years ago. &#39;Izzy this is a bad idea!&#39; Ugh! &#39;I&#39;m just going for the food! Leave me alone Aryn, just like you were not in the mood to talk with me before I am not in the mood for you!&#39; &#39;You will hurt him!&#39; &#39;I don&#39;t care, now leave me alone!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would would be honored Sumayah, at what time?&#34; Yum!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you wish we could leave now! Tomorrow the Warriors begin with the new training and they have been watching those who were of Blood Moon and have questions, so my brothers wish to ask them if that&#39;s ok?&#34; I hold the smile that wants to creep out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure! I&#39;ll link for a car, let&#39;s go. I am so hungry all the time now and I could go for pilaf right now!&#34; I link for Jacob to come to the front with a car and we go. We meet up with Suania who was on the way to the kitchens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you guys going?&#34; She looks like she had a beach day and just showered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dinner with Sumayah&#39;s family.&#34; Don&#39;t you dare!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I want to come! I haven&#39;t met anyone from Suma&#39;s family I was helping Maco with Amelia, remember?&#34; Damn it! And she says it tapping her foot, arms crossed and one eyebrow raised. In Nia speech this means &#39;You owe me!&#39; She ALWAYS does this! And she&#39;s damn good at it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, let&#39;s go.&#34; I do owe her, I was a robot while Maco was hurting and she stepped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob comes around with the car, his particular training will start soon since Braka wants to see to it himself but he has been very busy. But him taking this task is good for Hernán to mourn his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Last time we had a good Middle Eastern meal was that time in Karachi, remember Izzy?&#34; Oh Goddess how could I forget it was with her I was there with! Ura and I wanted to kill her and hide the body!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remembered the food I had just totally forgotten it was you in the assignment with us.&#34; And she laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn Izzy, just little over a week prego and you are in the fog!&#34; Fog?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What fog are you talking about?&#34; And she laughs even harder. What the hell is wrong with her? Yet I notice Sumayah looking out the window smiling and clearly knows something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can someone tell me what&#39;s going on?!&#34; Ok, what freaking fog?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She means pregnancy fog Loiza, in many cases when a woman is pregnant she starts forgetting or getting confused by little things that they usually wouldn&#39;t, it&#39;s totally fine Samira is about a month till she&#39;s due and has had it the entire pregnancy, she also has become quite clumsy. Don&#39;t stress, it shall pass.&#34; Yet I&#39;m stressing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t get dumb and clumsy, why didn&#39;t anyone tell me this!&#34; And I&#39;m just about to kick Nia who thinks it&#39;s hysterical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nia will you STOP?! It&#39;s not funny! I had a bad enough time when it was just the Block, now I have a FOG?&#34; She calms down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy it&#39;s fine! When I was in the hospital helping with Amelia I went to maternity and I learned a lot to help you with my nephews, and here I thought it would be Bayoán&#39;s baby I would help with first, then Ura spits his news, but it looks like you&#39;re going to be the one who I start with!&#34; Awe she was getting info for helping-- wait!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Suania what about Ura?!&#34; And she just laughs again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow Izzy, you REALLY were out of it! Frey is Prego too! It&#39;s like we&#39;re going to have a baby boom! Why do you think Isla has been knitting and embroidering up like a mad woman?&#34; Where in Hades is my head?! Isla didn&#39;t tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza, calm down. Everyone knows you have been not all there, relax.&#34; Sumayah says serenely. &#34;I must say Loiza, when you said we would be in buildings, we never expected skyscrapers, this is indeed a wonderful city and I can see why The Council wants this so much.&#34; I see you changing the subject! But I let it go... Hormones and now a damn fog!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are here ladies! Have a nice time!&#34; Where is he going?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you want to come?&#34; And he shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope, I&#39;m going to check out some boards at a shop down town. I am starting training with General Braka soon and won&#39;t be able to catch as many waves then.&#34; Might as well, Braka is going to break him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you guys are at The Nautilus!&#34; This building is a marvel, Nina can explain it better, it&#39;s basically what the name says, it&#39;s in the shape of a Nautilus shell, swirling up to the sky. Since every level to the top gets smaller, the balconies are large enough to hold beautiful gardens that sometimes spill to the lower levels. Most buildings in Itiba City are designed to resemble shells using the golden ratio. And Nina wants to continue the trend in the other city being built but is incorporating many other techniques and inspirations so it looks cohesive and has gathered an army of architects and engineers to achieve it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;re on the 11th floor and you can see all the way to The Fort from here! The moment Sumayah opens the door Suania starts hyperventilating!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34; And then I can see Yoni&#39;s golden eyes! Well shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And a younger version of Yahir appears with turquoise eyes turning black and I can&#39;t help but look at Sumayah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I guess we are officially family now!&#34; And Nia just runs to his arms and they start making out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, no introductions or anything huh? Just laying it all out there! Dude seriously?!&#34; Yahir comes forward and says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well so much for your self control training Nia! Now I remember why we had to leave Karachi early, you freaking growled at a human!&#34; I facepalm myself. And who I assume is Samira due to her advanced pregnancy patiently knocks on her brother&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nasser! The Alpha is here.&#34; And he raises a finger asking for another minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to Samira ignoring the pair completely. &#34;Hello you must be Samira, don&#39;t mind my sister she was dropped many times as a baby, I suspect on purpose.&#34; I say kissing both her cheeks, which is custom in their region same as here. People around the world have so much hate yet have so much in common and my forehead Mark starts soothing me like last time at the tough. But then Yahir comes straight at me to greet me in the same fashion and I KNOW that this is not common practice between men and women where they come from, although it is here. But I can&#39;t resist and I can&#39;t help but smile, I REALLY hope I&#39;m not blushing! Control Izzy, CONTROL! I give him a smile...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess you are getting used to OUR customs pretty well.&#34; And he gives a little laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So far we have been enjoying your customs very much! The hospitality here reminds me of what home used to be.&#34; And I answer with a sad smile. Sumayah reading the room... &#34;Come Alpha I also want you to meet Fatima.&#34; And a pretty girl who must be around 15 is in the kitchen cooking up a storm and Samira joins her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha this is Fatima she was sister to my late mate who was Beta of our old pack.&#34; Samira says with much love. And I greet her as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess the dummies in the living room need no introductions! Can I help with anything?&#34; I hope they don&#39;t cuz--</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let Izzy near a stove! As Alpha she has the ability of burning cereal!&#34; Suania shouts from the other room and now I am SURE my face must be NEON pink hoping the earth would swallow me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were busy stupid! It&#39;s not like you can do any better!&#34; Oh my Goddess what kind of impression will they have of us?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s just your fog speaking Izzy!&#34; I head out to kill her when Sumayah leads me outside to the beautiful garden balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yahir and Fatima are just laughing hysterically now and Samira gives them a LOOK. And they stop instantly, I already like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how far along are you Alpha?&#34; Samira asks calmly. And I blush at that, too. I give a fucking involuntary look at Yahir and autocorrect instantly yet in that instant I notice he is still giving me a dashing smile. I am a pregnant, mated female Alpha for Goddesses sake! Aryn was right, this WAS a mistake! Fatima places a tray with tea I can scent it&#39;s Cardamom, and Yahir serves me a cup still smiling! Ugh get a grip Loiza!! And it&#39;s the best I have had! So I use it to change the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Goddess! Fatima did you make this?&#34; And she give a cute smile and nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I take another sip. &#34;I think this is the best Cardamom I have had by far! You&#39;re truly gifted, do you want a job? We&#39;ll talk later, I think Karaya needs different cuisines and this would truly be a mayor hit! Suania get your tongue out of your mate and taste this!&#34; She might be embarrassing but she is keeping me distracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Nasser come out holding hands and I can finally meet my new brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to finally meet you Nasser welcome to the family!&#34; Wow, Nia is a lucky one he looks almost identical to his brother... Focus you idiot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Especially now that your tongue is outside my sister&#39;s throat!&#34; And he and Nia both blush deep beet red... Better them than me. But our family never backs down and the clap back came to hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Izzy, Samira asked you a question, don&#39;t be rude, it&#39;s unbecoming from an Alpha.&#34; And she gives me a devilish smile. Ugh! I breathe deep and exhale slowly. And look at Samira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am due in January.&#34; And she looks shocked. &#34;It&#39;s complicated.&#34; I respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nia grabs the chance to tell them EVERYTHING that happened! Every. Damn. Detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I can&#39;t anymore! And I wish I had a pillow to scream into! And she goes for the upper cut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh and Izzy, Nasser is coming home with us, I am so happy to have found my mate and lookie what a cutie he is, I already linked EVERYONE to tell them the news!&#34; She says with her sweetest smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what?! It IS GOOD NEWS! Maybe he will temper that tongue of yours since he keeps it so occupied!&#34; And this time Samira laughs and she is laughing hard! And Fatima and Sumayah sit next to her and put their hands on hers smiling and they give Yahir a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ok, what just happened? And Yahir pours some more tea and a cup for everyone and himself. He stands and offers a toast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To Alpha Loiza and our new sister Suania! For their hospitality and for bringing Samira&#39;s laughter back from the dead! Bil-&#39;áfya!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Nia nudges me with her elbow...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Salud!&#34; We say in unison. And drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two should go on tour!&#34; Samira says wiping some tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit, if you think that&#39;s funny, you see us all together, if you don&#39;t have a good clap back in our family we burn you as badly as Izzy burns boiling water! We will let things go only under certain conditions, you should see how Morgana adapted supper quick, but she&#39;s from Brooklyn so I guess she kinda had that down! Don&#39;t worry my adorable mate I won&#39;t let my siblings bully you!&#34; And Nasser now clearly looks nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samira starts to get up with difficulty and Yahir helps her up, she and Fatima go to the kitchen and Sumayah goes to help out with what smells like it&#39;s ready to eat. Is that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be for me? To have these babies without my mate until my own laughter dies too? Nia and Nasser go check out the view and I am left with Yahir. Who decides to sit closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had heard rumors of a the new powerful Alpha of the Osupa but from what your sister just recounted, it seems those rumors are an understatement! I saw a video yesterday of when the Holy Goddess crowned you. Again we had just heard rumors but to see it and hear the tale and finally meet you is another thing entirely. I didn&#39;t fear for Suma as she was protected in Avalon, but she holds no power to grant us sanctuary, yet I feared for Samira, we had one healer left but she was old and passed to the realm of the Goddess in the summer.&#34; He says in his deep voice, it actually sounds just like Kayden&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am so sorry to hear what your people have endured, we were quite lost for a moment as well. We lost so many, we are making sure to identify every remains so we can to give closure to the families and to add them to the list for a memorial.&#34; I don&#39;t dare tell him that we are also listing the dead and missing one by one to add to the articles of war to be presented to The Council along with Mortiana&#39;s head which is in an dry ice in Avalon, there was no way Moira would allow for her to defy Selene even more by taking her own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your people were very lucky to have you. A Gamma Priestess of the Goddess who became an Alpha and did the ultimate sacrifice for her people. You truly are an exceptional woman Alpha, I hope one day your mate knows what a precious ruby you are.&#34; I look away from him but he takes my chin so I may look at him. &#34;If not, I hope you find the happiness you deserve.&#34; I see the blue of Farabale Beach in his eyes. Damn fog! I am afraid that he might try to kiss me, but he stands up and offers his hand to lead me to the dinning room. I take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s to hope and that we never loose it.&#34; I say lifting my tea cup and he clanks our cups. &#34;To hope.&#34; He responds.</p>
