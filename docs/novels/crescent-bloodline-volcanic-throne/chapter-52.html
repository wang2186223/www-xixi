                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was great spending time with Loiza... then why do I have this bittersweet taste in my mouth. I link Avis so he can inform the pack of the conditions for atending tonight&#39;s ceremony for the Osupa, while on my way to Marcus&#39; room when Nancy stops me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, sorry to disturb you, but a young she wolf is waiting in your office.&#34; Fuck, just what I need... I don&#39;t even ask what she wants, I go to my office ready to kick out some thirsty hoe, yet what I find is nothing like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Kayden, I need your help!&#34; A girl more or less my age, with short dark chocolate hair and very big green bloodshot eyes, in tears and a nasty bruise on the side of her face, the epitomy of a nervous breakdown. And she throws herself at my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa, whoa, hey! What&#39;s your name and what help do you seek?&#34; I hand her a box of tissues and sit on my chair offering and empty chair across from my desk. She dries her tears but the tears keep flowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, I am Diana, and I made a terrible mistake! When The Osupa arrived I found my true mate among them... but I was already with someone, so I rejected him...the very second I did this I felt sick but ignored it and went home to my...husband.&#34; She blew her nose and went on... &#34;He has been pushing for pups for some time now, but not even a hint.&#34; I&#39;ve known Logan since we were kids and we promised that if we ever found our true mates we would reject them. So when I got home, I told him what happened to make him happy. He got angry instead! He started calling me a whore and that now that I have found my mate he wouldn&#39;t be able to trust me!&#34; She started sobbing and blowing her nose. &#34;I don&#39;t even know HIS name, but I can&#39;t stop thinking of him! I tried to see him again, but the Osupa Beta will not even give me his name... he found out I was married and told me to return to my husband and that they&#39;re trying to negotiate with the Goddess to cut our Bond, but...&#34; And she literally falls again to her knees begging! &#34;PLEASE Alpha! I don&#39;t want my husband! I don&#39;t know the name of my mate, but I feel like I NEED HIM! PLEASE plead my case to Alpha Loiza! Logan&#39;s mood has been getting more violent each year... I thought if I gave him the pup he wants he would be the same old Logan, I thought if I assured him that I rejected my mate he would love me again! Today he found out I have been trying to contact my mate and... and...&#34; She just turned into a whailing ball. What the fuck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, Diana I need you to try to calm down!&#34; I link Nancy to bring a sedative and some tea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He raped me, beat me and said I was just some worthless Omega who didn&#39;t deserve his protection.&#34; Shit...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is your husband, do you wish for a divorce?&#34; She looked at me with her sad pretty eyes. I just want my mate&#39;s name at LEAST. I know I have destroyed everything, but maybe his name will console me.&#34; If only... Nancy arrives with what I ask. And I remember Nancy is also an Omega... what kind of a healer would she have been had her strength be nurtured. I have a LOT of correcting to do in this pack. &#34;Nancy stay with Diana here, I have to go handle something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I first go check on Marcus, he did mention this and last I saw him he was having a meltdown of his own. I entered his room and I see the Healer Tatiana giving him a pale green liquid and him looking very well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother, here I was ready for the worst yet you&#39;re good!&#34; And he smiles at me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I barely remember anything after the Priestess of Avalon pulled out that sword... Master Tatiana has been putting my mind back together.&#34; He said merrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is ready to continue his Beta duties Alpha, but he must continue taking the medicine I made, it&#39;s specifically made for him taking his blood type, genetic coding and Beta brain waves into account. Now remember Beta, one sip at dawn and the other at dusk just like I administered now. Enjoy the ceremony tonight and tomorrow we&#39;ll have another talk to see how you&#39;re doing, doctors orders, understood?&#34; He puts the bottle by his bedside and thanks her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master Tatiana there is a girl in my office who could use your help, would you mind checking on her?&#34; I explain the situation...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will be my pleasure to help the girl... but her problem is fixable. Our Beta follows a lot of his father&#39;s, the old Beta&#39;s, teachings and we are very pleased that the Cacique chose him. But between us, Bayoán can be a stickler for protocol. If her true mate is willing to forgive her the Beta has no say in the matter, this would not be the first time in our history were we have been rejected by an outsider and it got solved. I&#39;ll go to the girl, but go directly to Loiza with this... if the girl truly had a change of heart, our Alpha will take it into consideration.&#34; She gives us a warm smile and she starts to leave to my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you truly not fear to speak your mind about your Beta?&#34; Pffffft! And she just laughts &#34;By the Goddess, Alpha! We have free speech! We can say what we want of whomever, do you guys have a Gestapo type milicia or something?!&#34; And she leave laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it true? Are you yourself again?&#34; I ask Marcus hesintanly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be the same. In 24 hours Tatiana has done more for my mental stability than years of me trying to figure it out myself. But I feel like I can see very clearly now.&#34; I tell Marcus everything that I learned from Loiza and he remains calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That information is definitely not at The Council&#39;s library. But it makes sense. The Osupa are very in tune with the will of the Goddess who is also Goddess of balance. I am going to take a shower and change, go to your mate, tell her about Diana and plead her case. It would be a shame to loose an able warrior like her dearest husband, because of us having to put down a rabid dog down. I&#39;ll check who he is. Which takes me to another question, when are you telling Loiza about Lydia?&#34; Is he mad?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus! I just told you what would happen to her if they find out!&#34; And he just facepalms himself...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Goddess brother, I can&#39;t leave you alone for shit!.. KAYDEN! You ASKED Loiza about the &#39;What&#39;s if&#39;s of Priestesses!&#39; How long do you suspect she or her Beta, who Yeah, I AGREE with you! I can&#39;t posibly belive I will say &#39;YOUR RIGHT KAYDEN!&#39; Is a goddessdamn BEAST. He used to be intimate with The Prime Priestess of Avalon, basically the Goddess&#39;s VOICE on Earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So he serves as a filter between the Lady Moira and your mate without having your mates loyalty questioned, yet not be a puppet. BRILLIANT! And POOF! Not just do they have a masterful and powerful Alpha, they have crowned a Queen! So let&#39;s do the math...she is Gamma born, raised in Avalon, tought strategy by her father, a Beta, who has adapted her own brain waves to follow that pattern, was thought stealth, traking and hunting from her damn Alpha mother, was breast by a Luna and thought combat by General Braka,  another Beta! Brother... she probably ALREADY knows! You MUST tell her in Goodwill so we and posibly the pack be spared! Maybe negotiate! Even with her suspicion, she loves you as mate... she has put Daniella, whom from what I hear is the Alpha Healer, she is sole healer to the Alpha&#39;s Fort and the elite. She serves the people now as the final consultant to determine the rarest diseases... so she has already ordered her best healer, prepared for a malady for which they have a cure just for YOUR care, brother. She is puting her TOP dog... to make sure that you&#39;re treated for!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re not going to confess she will find a way to get that information and in a smart way.&#34; And I can&#39;t belive the hole I have dug for myself. I had not taken many of Marcus&#39;s points into account. But if she does leave Daniella I still may have a chance to persuade her... but how do they expect me to take my mother&#39;s head off? SHIT!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother meet me at the medical tent if Diana&#39;s mate is recieving therapy, I guess he will be there.&#34; I tell him now in my paranoid version.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden, tell her or we might find ourselves with that blade over our neck!&#34; How could they put me in this position?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cross the front grounds determined to at the very least help Diana. I go to the tent where I left Loiza but was stoped by some Warriors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to speak with your Cacique at once!&#34; I say loud enough so she hears me herself. I see her come out of the tent followed by her Beta, Yaya, Braka and The Priestess of Avalon, who doesn&#39;t even look at me, she walks into a portal and is gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza, I have something urgent to speak with you!&#34; She looks at her brother and nods.  The Warriors let me pass, and I try to look casual. I walk up to her and explain the Diana situation... she looks at me with a cold expression for what felt like days. She looks at her brother again clearly linking him. And he just shrugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me to this Diana&#39;s mate.&#34; Her Beta rolls his eyes and shoots daggers at me. And he leads us to the tent for mental trauma. Inside it has more people than the one for physical trauma. We reach a young Warrior, a Gamma from his build. Loiza goes to a doctor and I can see she links her the situation, and the doctor nods and now addressing the patient: &#34;Arasibo, remember what we talked of posibilities?&#34; His eyes look dead, but he looks at her and nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well one of the those posibilities has ocurred, now it&#39;s up to YOU how to proceed, ok?&#34; She explains everything that happened since last he saw his mate from Diana&#39;s recount to me. &#34;She is in Alpha Kayden&#39;s office right now, we can go and have a chat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...&#34; She looks at me asking permision, I nod immediately. &#34;... or you can flat out reject her, and possibly give up the Blessing of the Goddess and try to find peace.&#34; He closes his eyes and see him take a deep breath and his eyes sudently open with a turquoise glow, his gaze on me. Canines out and he launges himself at me...I am an unmarked Alpha with his mates scent on me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SIBO STOP!&#34; And he fell midair by Loiza&#39;s Alpha command. &#34;Bring the girl HERE, if she wants redemption, let her come seek it, no one will stop her.&#34; And she gives a cold look at her brother while walking out the tent followed by Arasibo and his doctor. We go two tents over where it looks like a makeshift office for Loiza she sits at her desk in deep thought. And Diana comes in followed by Tatiana...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it true? Are you taking back your rejection?&#34; Arasibo asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I have your name mate...?&#34; She asks in a very weak voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you may not! You can&#39;t ask for consolation from me, either you&#39;re my mate or you&#39;re not.&#34; Loiza didn&#39;t take her cold eyes from Diana and I signal to her for a word. And her eyes went from bright amber to molten gold my way in less than a second. A warning, as they return to Diana and stay gold. I felt pure rage through our Bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make your choice girl! Or I&#39;ll make it for you. Both Loiza and Arasibo speak in one voice and Loiza&#39;s eyes are now all white, the Goddess herself is speaking through her! Diana understood what was going on, she taped into her mate Bond with Arasibo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I choose the mate bestowed upon to me by the Goddess, he KNOWS he has never left my thoughts. He KNOWS my pain and I know his, I am sorry!&#34; She falls begging on her knees. And Arasibo goes to her and lifts her from the floor and takes in her scent and she closes her eyes breathing his. He starts kissing her and Loiza stands up and tells everyone to leave and to Arasibo...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sibo I asume you will be on active duty soon?&#34; He nods while kissing his mate starting to undress her... &#34;Good, now make sure not to go near your mate&#39;s EX-husband or I guarantee you you will not enjoy her for long, understood?&#34; And he nods again. &#34;Alpha Kayden I suggest that the girl&#39;s EX-husband stay away from the now member of my pack unless he has a death wish... I may be no genie but I LOVE granting those.&#34; We walk out and we hear them exange names. And the sounds of zippers and moans. While Loiza joins the others back to their original tent.</p>
