                <p>Aymaco&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After my little chat with Alpha Kayden I go back to check on Iza... Already Jolene has returned with the food and brought another girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jolene are you feeling better and who is your lovely friend?&#34; I ask the visibly more calm girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Aymaco, I am so sorry for my blunder, please I hope you can forgive me.&#34; She says with her head hung low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Little one you have nothing to be sorry for, you even said that my sister thanked you! Why would she do that if you did anything wrong? I know what is necessary to do when Loiza is in this state. Tell me truthfully, how did she get in the tub? If she was puking she must have been in the floor, I KNOW she wouldn&#39;t have the energy to get in herself.&#34; Our family has been through this with Loiza several times and we know that once her energy was spent she would not be able to even raise a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I picked up and put her in. &#34; She started sniffling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you are a strong one! There you see? Like I told you before, she had us on standby as a precaution, she is young, but she knows her limitations and she knew that we were close. Now no more tears ok?&#34; She wiped her nose and nodded her head and a little smile graced her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, Ura wake her so she can eat something&#34; He knows the dril and goes to her feet and starts tickling them until she stirs and opens her eyes and kicks Ura right in his gut. The girls start giggling at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, yeah it&#39;s hysterical until it&#39;s you who gets kicked!&#34; And he chuckles with the girls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you guys serious I feel like I&#39;m dead...&#34; Iza whispers drowsily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy we are very serious, get up a little, look Jolene brought something for you to eat so that when you go down for the count you don&#39;t have an empty stomach honey, now come on.&#34; I help her sit as best she can and give her a sip of water first and she drinks it slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jolene did you bring the blow dryer?&#34; Ura asks her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! And I brought my best friend Kendra to dry it! She is really good at doing hair and make up. If I dry her hair I will mess it up.&#34; She says sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can she dry it while I sleep?&#34; Izzy asks weakly while taking a sip of soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kendra?&#34; Jolene asks the silent girl. She had been so quiet that I had completely forgotten that I even asked about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Jo can help me then yes, but it won&#39;t be as pretty.&#34; The girl responds with a timid voice.  Her obsidian eyes lowered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t need it styled, she just needs it dry, so it&#39;s ok and I am sure Jolene will help, right Jolene?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course! I would be happy to!&#34; She responds enthusiastically. And by this time Izzy pushes back the rest of the soup and Ura is helping her with the tea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jolene, would you like to be an official assistant to the Priestess?&#34; I ask her. The girl clearly seems very devout to the Goddess to be willing to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I really?!&#34; She puts her hands to her chest and her eyes become bright as if I had offered her a precious stone. I also notice the other girl give Jolene an expectant look. But Izzy gives me a side glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With training, sure!&#34; I answer. &#34;You will learn everything and anything you need to know to serve a Priestess correctly. Like not allowing her hair to get wet when she is and a medicinal bath, it was an honest mistake, but now you know better, and understand the why it should not be allowed to get wet. You basically had your first lesson today!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can Kendra train with me? She also failed her trials but still wants to serve the Goddess!&#34; I look at Kendra and before lowering her head I saw that her eyes were glazed over. I remember when Loiza passed her trials when she was only 5 years old, I remember the other two little girls who failed, they couldn&#39;t stop crying. I was 13 back then and didn&#39;t understand what all the fuss was about. Ura is quick to answer...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, two is better than one!&#34; And Kendra&#39;s face lights up with a wide smile, her black almond eyes brightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By this time Izzy had finished the tea and was about to go under again any moment. Ura helps her lie down again and tucks her in  kissing her forehead. We are all protective of her and our other sisters, but since she returned from Avalon she would stick to Ura like glue. He is an exceptional tracker, one day he went out hunting and she followed him, he knew he was being followed and decided to teach her. She had only known Avalon and we were exited to have our little sister back, since then they have been inseparable, since she had learned everything from him they were a very good team going out on missions outside of the island. Of all of us, it is Ura who knows Izzy the best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then, I have to meet up with your Alpha to sort out somethings, I will mention your training. By the way how old are you girls?&#34; A pack with a Luna who used to be a High Priestess is strange, but with NONE? And these girls look of an age that they should have concluded their High Priestess training by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am 16 and Jo is 15.&#34; Kendra answers as she and Jolene take the damp towel from Iza&#39;s hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, then were is the girl who DID pass the trials, did she decide to continue her education to be a Prime Priestess?&#34; I say this looking directly at Ura so he understands that I am finding this very unusual. About a month before this mornings events The Grand Priestess of Avalon had contacted Alpha Gúarionex giving him the names of the next three girls who would take the trials to be trained as Priestess. Karaya already has two Priestesses and Avalon was granting a third. Yet this Pack has none. I see him look at the girls for the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she only finished her Priestess training but shortly after her return was killed by Rouges in an attack.&#34; Jolene said sadly. I see Ura now looking at me with a look that I know too well and he links me... &#39;This is a load of bullshit, when Izzy returned at 14 she could easily beat 10 well trained warriors on her own without shifting. Something is not right here.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Avalon offered to take another girl?&#34; Ura asks them. By this time the girls were  untangling Iza&#39;s hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No idea, you would have to ask the Alpha.&#34; Jolene said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I most certainly will, it seems as if the Goddess has taken her Blessings away from this pack. And yet she destined Izzy to be mated to it&#39;s Alpha. Is that why we were offered another Priestess and Blood Moon none? Urayoán decides to stay with Iza going to a couch in the room and lying down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I am staying with her, do me a favor bro, bring me my bag and something to eat. I am standing guard over Izzy until she wakes.&#39; He&#39;s now restless, even I&#39;m restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Agreed&#39;. After I get him what he requested I decide to go meet with Braka and Bayoán. The boats haven&#39;t arrived and I want to contact them to find another rendezvous point. My mind is now going a mile a minute.</p>
