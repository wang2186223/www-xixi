                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, I&#39;m feeling like myself again, like BOTH my selves but in cohesion. We&#39;re waiting for Bayoán to take me to Blood Moon, I totally ditched Marcus again! Ha!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s so happy for her reunion with Sophia, I made sure that she would always find Phi the moment she would wake. I was enjoying watching Sophia on her shoulder while she fed her some raw meat she ordered from the kitchens, it filled me with nostalgia... Phi would usually feed her while we would lounge by the gardens in the evenings, the scent of laurels filling the air. I wanted to give her an additional edge over Athena who would carry Glaukopis on the top of her spear... She would harness only a bit of it&#39;s potential. Phi didn&#39;t just carry Sophia around like a pet, not that she didn&#39;t love her, Phi would pamper her to the point even I would be jealous... That&#39;s when my grandmother would slap the back of my head...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stupid boy! I have Blessed you with knowledge, I gave you the gift of healing! You are a GOD! She a Nymph... When have you seen a Nymph best Athena? Sophia is helping Phi focus her potential... Leave Athena to her arrogance, let the raven fill her with wisdom, affection, healing, longevity and fertility. Sophia is doing exactly what you commanded! Are you so far gone in her arms that you forget who you are?&#34; I wonder if she&#39;s awake herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to have Master Jorel make a beautiful perch for you Sophia, I have truly missed you!&#34; Bayoán and Janaína come out to where we were. I stand up to go with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo, what&#39;s up with the bird? It makes you next level emo Izzy!&#34; Izzy and I laughed at that... She WAS wearing a black kimono with yellow flamboyán blossoms on the bottom... I can&#39;t wait to see what the Japanese Kappas come up with, she LOVES them and she looks like the Goddess she is in them and even better when I take them off!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Sophia! Isn&#39;t she beautiful? Kayden gave her to me!&#34; Her wings had that iridescent blue shine to them like her own raven hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jana comes over to check her out... &#34;Does she bite?&#34; She reaches out to pet Sophia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it matter if it bites or not?! Kayden when did you get that bird in here man?!&#34; I feel Izzy laughing through the Bond, I&#39;m missing something here...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up with the ornithophobic man? It&#39;s her code name remember? Besides, Moira ported her here.&#34; And Izz can&#39;t stop laughing making Sophia fly closer to Bayoán and him avoiding her making Izzy just laugh harder! What am I missing? Our Bond is adjusting to Loiza and Kayden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayo will you relax! Changó won&#39;t be offended by a raven!&#34; Ohh, I SEE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>L: &#39;No Love, you were on point... He IS ornithophobic! He is just to arrogant to admit it. I&#39;m just laying it on a little thicker! I&#39;m going to take this little encounter for him communicate with Nina and fix the shrines of The Orishas, watch and learn.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>K: &#39;Nice! A show!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, what am I missing?&#34; Jana asks. I just laugh with Izz, is it the size?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jana, Bayoán holds worship to The Orisha Changó... HIS protected animal in The Caribbean, is the chango bird. You know, the ones that look like mini crows all over the islands? I don&#39;t know the how you worship them in Brazil, I would appreciate a report on that though. Anyway he&#39;s afraid Sophia might offend him since she is way bigger! What&#39;s up brother? Having size issues?!&#34; Right under the belt! I can&#39;t wait to see the recap of how their reunion/blood bath goes! It&#39;s just Marcus and me and our relationship has never been like THEIRS, we don&#39;t have cousins or any extended family except for the pack. THIS... this is going to be family night, The Purge edition!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy you DARE mention his name without the beads?!&#34; Esangó is actually a real calm dude, sure he&#39;s also a fire god and used to wreak havoc when he was younger but the ages chilled him out. He&#39;s just as misunderstood as Ares and Dionysus. I sat down across from them, Jana sat next to me and we were just watching the match!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shove it Bayo! TRUST me, Lord Changó doesn&#39;t give a shit about it! If you&#39;re such a fervent follower why don&#39;t you take some time and talk about restoring The Orisha Shrines with Nina? Morgana is talking about bringing a coven who serve The Orishas, do you want me to receive them with those shrines in THAT condition?!&#34; She stood up and crossed her arms glaring at him. Sophia returned to perch on her shoulder, brings back memories! As long as I&#39;M not in the receiving end of her scorn she can fire away!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izz I don&#39;t need to talk to Nina for that! I&#39;LL handle it! You just make sure THAT... animal stays the fuck away from me!&#34; To see all this shit show in her head vs. live is SOOOO different. He&#39;s just pointing at Sophia in clear disdain now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT did you call HER?! BAYOÁN JOSÉ MIRABAL REAL, IF you lay ONE finger on Sophia consider it lost for good, that&#39;s a fair warning pendejo!&#34; I&#39;m so glad that I learned Spanish!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you seriously threatening me over a BIRD? Trust me little sister, I don&#39;t want to be near that cursed thing!&#34; Wow, he&#39;s really putting the outrage out there! As an artist myself I tip my hat! What a performance!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is it, that somebody as educated as you has always been so superstitious?! What are we going to do? Ban cats now from Karaya because you don&#39;t want them crossing your path?!&#34; She&#39;s pinching the bridge of her nose. Her face is priceless, you can tell she totally wants to smack him around, I&#39;m totally for it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re talking like if you don&#39;t know anything! And it&#39;s only black cats! The Fae put all those rules for a reason!&#34; Izzy just facepalms herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I KNOW you&#39;re seriously not going to try to educate me again on the ways of Avalon and fae magic, I think we all remember how that turned out the last time!&#34; Ugh! Now I remember! I had actually ordered Moira a few lifetimes ago to ensure that Caliburn stay in my hand for as long as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gaia wouldn&#39;t have allowed me being corrupted by Mordred, the corruption is meant for someone else. And now I remember I cannot remove Mordred from the sword, there is a purpose for him to be there. Izzy though she was protecting me from Caliburn, but how could she know that it was necessary? I never told Phi HOW I would awaken earlier, I LOVED that I got the better of her in this. This time around it bit me in the ass big time, I have to tell her... her subconscious will retain the information. I&#39;m partially to blame for that damn Block! Sigh, I&#39;ll talk to her about it and amend the contract when I meet Selene again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo, Jana, how long do these usually last?&#34; I ask. She sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From what I have seen from Bayoán&#39;s head... It starts at birth until...&#34; And she looks at her watch. &#34;... 1:03 p.m. (now). Should we order popcorn?&#34; Ha! I definitely like her. Suddenly Víctor walks in with Shomari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayo what the fuck man?! The Lady Conceição is waiting to send Kayden to Blood Moon and then all FOUR of us are going to have a little chat about yesterday&#39;s meeting before I kick you out to go on leave! Don&#39;t you see genius? Morgana is a witch and has been pregnant for 9 months and you reek of her anxiety!&#34; Víctor says with a serious face clearly aggravated. And Shomari starts laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I say we order the popcorn now.&#34; I whisper to Jana and just presses her lips, raises her eyebrows and nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mate was having contractions, I was a LITTLE distracted VIC!&#34; Bayo says grinding his teeth and Izzy comes and sits on my lap while I wrap my arms around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this about the raven Bayo? Are you seriously afraid of birds?!&#34; Shomari asks him petting Sophia. I&#39;m thoroughly enjoying watching Bayoán like this! We&#39;re cool now, but I know he enjoyed himself torturing me, it&#39;s funny to see that cocky, arrogant, dumbass brat get some!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not afraid of no damn BIRD! I jus--&#34; Víctor is DONE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shomari, Bayoán is devout to the Goddesses but also holds worship to Changó, just like his Dad, Ayiti, Maco and Natalia. He IS afraid of the bird in the way that he fears it will disrespect the smaller blackbirds of Changó, however half this Island knows that he IS a total ornithophobic... Cacique, we will handle it from here. Alpha c&#39;mon, we have to get you back so you can pack and make sure everything is in order over there, we will have eyes on you. Once Blood Moon is about to be air borne I&#39;ll get you back with the Lady Ayana. Does anybody have questions?&#34; Damn! He IS faster than Bayoán, I just thought it was Izzy&#39;s biased opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayo, Lord Changó doesn&#39;t give a fuck about birds man, just because YOUR people named them that, it doesn&#39;t matter.&#34; Bayoán gives him a death glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t give me that look Bayoán! I might have lived most of my life in London but I AM Ewe dude! You want those shrines to look good? I&#39;ll send my cousin and her Dad, they&#39;re Kappas, and hold worship to ALL The Orishas, ok?&#34; Well damn Izz&#39;s little bullshit show worked!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn Bayo! Shomari just took you to school son! Víctor thanks man I need to go to the shrines to meditate, tell Magdalena to instruct the girls to have it ready. We&#39;re going to be receiving almost 10,000 wolves I need to clear my mind. Postpone tomorrow&#39;s meeting until Chandrama and Blood Moon are settled, how does that sound?&#34; He scowls going through it again, nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal, but Izz, the tattoos, TOMORROW, no bullshit! Kayden man, you have to back me up here!&#34; I can&#39;t help but smile. First time I met him he held a pretty big gun to my head, I did feel a little intimidated by him then, only to find out he and Izz where an item... But now I see WHY she was attracted to him to begin with! He is A LOT like ME!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, I agree! She needs those done, in fact I have to change the one on my back, don&#39;t worry she won&#39;t go anywhere tomorrow until that ink is on her skin, you have my word Víctor.&#34; I pat Izz&#39;s delicious ass to get her up. That nap with her and the pups was something I REALLY needed. I want this DONE ASAP and be able to just listen to the waves dreaming with her in my arms, those were the best years on the Aegean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you seriously telling my mate to tell me what to do Beta?&#34; She says standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did it work? Izz I don&#39;t give a shit! As long as that damn ink is on your skin before tomorrow night, comprende Cacique?! Now get ready, Magdalena and the girls are getting everything ready, ok? The faster I send the Alpha to get Blood Moon, the faster I can have him back! And now that I KNOW he CAN persuade you, you can bet your ass I WILL see to it that he IS informed on several things... Copy that Kayden?&#34; Ha! He&#39;s good! He&#39;s totally willing to throw me under the bus as long as I can make sure she does what she has to! And just make sure that she doesn&#39;t forget that I do hold persuasion over her as much as she does over me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roger that!&#34; Her eyes are throwing daggers at me and I just grab her hand and bring her in and give her a deep kiss!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be back tonight babe and give her another one and she throws her arms around my neck deepening the kiss making Sophia fly off, spooking Bayoán again and making Shomari and Janaína laugh at him while Víctor facepalms himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beta Janaína, take Beta Bayoán to the office, Goddesses knows I don&#39;t want him having a breakdown over a bird! BOTH of you wait for me there. Cacique, is there anything else you need?&#34; She smiles at me a little wicked smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Please send over Master Jorel... I want her to make a beautiful perch for Sophia out of myrtle tree wood, with hyacinth and orange blossoms engraved on it and a python surrounding it with swans at the base.&#34; She remembers that too!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously Izzy? How much you intend to spend on a perch for that bird?!&#34; Bayoán complains while being pushed out by Jana, Víctor is just pinching the bridge of his nose, eyes shut tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you say Cacique... C&#39;mon you two let&#39;s get Blood Moon airborne!&#34; I kiss her again, her arms around my neck not budging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby I--&#34; She kissed me again and in my ear she whispers: &#34;I love you my Sun!&#34; I hold her taking in her scent. &#34;I love you my Sea!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izz, I know it&#39;s hard but c&#39;mon!&#34; It&#39;s harder than he will ever know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Kayden ask Moira where&#39;s my bow and my trident, now that I&#39;m awake I feel vulnerable without them, ok?&#39; She asks through our link... Damn right!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Me too! I have Caliburn but she didn&#39;t bring my bow either. I&#39;ll check, be back later ok?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where are our weapons?! Izzy is an amazing fighter, but she is a surgeon with that trident! She ALMOST killed that asshole herself with it once... Almost... Triton, Rhode, Asclepius, Calypso, Helios, I&#39;ll see if we can meet, we couldn&#39;t last lifetime.</p>
