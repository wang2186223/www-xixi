                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Kayden&#39;s sudden take charge demeanor I start getting very excited. I am remembering! But there&#39;s so MANY memories...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turns me over on my stomach and raises my ass towards him, he opens my legs wide, and looks inside my core, but what he is looking at right now is a dripping faucet! He takes a few licks of me and then without warning he thrust himself with strength and power inside of me, I gasp with surprise, he massages my back down to make sure that my torso and head remained on the mattress. And suddenly CRACK! He smacked the left cheek of my ass hard!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHOA! THE HELL?!&#34; I scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry babe! You owed me that one, now we&#39;re even!&#34; And I hear him laughing, and I can very much hear Deacon laughing with him! I can&#39;t help but laugh too! He is so deep inside me now, while one of his hands goes to my pussy and he starts massaging my clit gently while picking up some momentum and my moans turned to screams and just as we&#39;re both about come, he stops. I look back frustrated, his smile grows and crawls up to lay by my side and takes me in his arms and lays me slowly on my back. He presses himself gently against me, never breaking eye contact. He looked down at my body and rubbed my side until he reached my hips. He looked at me full of yearning. I pressed my hand to his cheek and he closed his eyes to my touch. Slowly I hear the gentle sound of his Lyre in my mind... He used to play it so beautifully...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His knee opened my legs and he entered me slowly like that first time long ago I decided to accept him... I resisted Ares himself who even Aphrodite can&#39;t get away from! And this one steals my prey and plays me his lyre to apologize, he then excused himself handing me my original pray with his beautiful golden arrow through it. When I took the arrow out of the dove it fell to the ground cascading into thousands of white water lilies at my feet. Every sunrise and sunset I would feel his gaze on me I would look up and see his Jade eyes just staring at me, the water lilies he gave me never died. I started nurturing them with the purest water. And one sunset I decided to show him that he was welcome in my presence and that I would speak with him, so I wore one of the water lilies in my hair. I think it was the first time the sun stop setting... He stopped his chariot immediately, all of my sisters started cheering with glee over the sight of the sun god. For a second I thought I made a mistake, but he kept riding. He came in the night and took me away...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love I KNOW I am Kayden, but right NOW I WANT you as before.&#34; He pushes into me as I embrace him and press my cheek to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all right, I want you as we were as well...&#34; To this he just pushes in harder and lifts me to him as we look into each other. I had already heard all the other stories about him just like the other gods. Using someone and then discarding them, I was prepared for that. The gods are ficle. But when Zeus promised me to his brother Poseidon as bride, my golden Sun became full of rage, but there was nothing he could do against the might of his father and then the might of my husband...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We made love for a long time, and it felt like old times, always the roaring of the ocean serving as background and warning. And even though he made love to me as Apollo he was already accepting that this was a new life cycle and I started soothing the waves of the ocean so instead of roaring it would be just a gentle rush. The breeze of the Caribbean was so much like the breeze of the Aegean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let the rest of my body fall on the bed and Kayden goes to the fridge to get 2 bottles of water and drops himself on the bed. While I can&#39;t move, he opens a water bottle, turns me on my back and takes me in his arms. He takes a good look at me and smiles with a little &#34;Hmp&#34;, he raises my upper body enough and slowly brings the bottle to my lips and starts pouring the cold liquid in my mouth. I didn&#39;t even have to ask! I lift my hand to hold the bottle and lie back into his chest. He opens the other bottle and when one of his arms is free he wraps it around my waist and proceeds to drink as well laying himself on the head board of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stayed like that for a few minutes, I am so at peace in the silence with him, he is getting a barrage of emotions from me, I feel the outpour of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izz I&#39;ll sign any paper you want me to sign and I&#39;ll take any test you want me to take. The pack already is inclined to want to come. But I can&#39;t stop those who wish to stay. What you guys did today... HOW?! I have heard of the synchronization of The Osupa, but this is some next level shit!&#34; I STILL feel the WHOLE pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m still figuring it out. Chandrama is on its way because of it, but it was basically a physical manifestation of our collective pain and anger towards The Council. We had two more buildings but there were complications, still I have a hunch we made our point very loud and clear. We also hacked into the humans nuclear warheads, those won&#39;t be launching any time soon if ever!&#34; I already ordered that today be a day of celebration and remembrance, so Antoine got his leave anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa speaking of hunches you guys destroyed Nina yesterday! Felt good for your brother! But man, I would have shot my brain with silver if I would&#39;ve been in Tony&#39;s shoes!&#34; Hades! That WAS yesterday!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still can&#39;t believe that was yesterday! But yeah, oh man Ura went to town and when she started ugly crying... Ha! I knew that it was either the end of The Circle or a renaissance. So I decided to take both Nina&#39;s and Ura&#39;s option off the table so I used my trump card leaving them without a choice... SIMPLE!&#34; He wrapped his arms around me, kissing my Mark, my neck, my face, my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Either way, happy birthday Love, you have to admit... It was better than your Quinceañera!&#34; Ha! That&#39;s for sure!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No shit, Circle Excursion, The District, thrashing Nina, racing in Atabex City! And then a worldwide terrorist attack on terrorists! What a GREAT DAY!&#34; He kissed my head and held me tighter chuckling, he laughs so beautifully...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could that same extraction be used for Blood Moon?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would depend. If it&#39;s not an international airport and small numbers it shouldn&#39;t be a problem... With the panic and chaos happening all over the globe it could be overlooked. We would have to look at the data before moving forward. Now that THIS is out of my head I can take a breather.&#34; He&#39;s ok he&#39;s is accepting the fact that he&#39;s Kayden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can order Moira to see what can be done?&#34; I guess that&#39;s an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure but no joke Kayden, take your grandmother with you, if there&#39;s treachery in your pack she&#39;ll know.&#34; Oh yeah, I knew my old Master was here when I awoke! She&#39;s always been sneaky, but I have loved my Master for her gifts, without her I would be just another Neriad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You noticed that too, huh? I wonder what price she had to pay, they had her as a slave in MY pack! I can&#39;t wait to hear what she&#39;s going to yap at me. You&#39;ll talk with her right Beloved? She always liked you better!&#34; So good at delegating! He laughs at my thought... I get up to go shower, I&#39;m awake anyway and am hungry and want our pups brought over for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pick up my hair while watching him still lounging on the bed, his arms behind his head watching me, bringing a smile to my lips... He looked... focus idiot! He laughs and I walk into the shower and he jumped off the bed to join me. We couldn&#39;t help it and made love again in the shower... Now that I FEEL HIS emotions it drives me to madness!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hand him a robe and get my own kimono and summon Mónica to bring my pups and ordered a lunch platter from the kitchens. He picks me bridal style and plants another kiss on me and we get a knock at the door. I take them from Mónica and dismiss her telling her I&#39;ll link her later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hand Jade to her father and he sits on the bed with her... He&#39;s quiet. I unfasten my robe to grant Deacon access to feed, Kayden&#39;s nostrils flare and looks over and comes with Jade and helps me with her and wraps his arms around us taking in our scent, his own relaxation to finally have his family in his embrace is pushed towards me through the Bond. I take a deep breath letting his love drown us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food came and we went out to the dinning area in the balcony. We all eat lunch in silence... I&#39;m still processing everything including what happened this morning and already thinking what will be the most likely next move. He starts laughing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I look around to see what&#39;s so funny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YOU ARE Beloved! Here I am trying to still remember your name and your already thinking what comes next!&#34; I hand him the pups, they&#39;re full and wipe myself and get some paper. THIS usually does the trick! I write down the name that I always want to forget and pass it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reads it, he KNOWS not to mention an unwanted name. His face becomes dark nodding smelling Deacon&#39;s hair. And looks over the ocean...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already SWORE to you he would never have you again Amphitrite!&#34; And finally! He looks at me again... &#34;PHI! I remember!&#34; He closes his eyes allowing the puzzle on his side to register. I go to take the pups but he looks calmly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have them Phi, give me a moment Love...&#34; He said gently, he always had this calm in his voice. I sit down remembering. Always, to every child we have had he grants HIS own Blessings. For a god who guarded and guided The Oracle at Delphi to change to such a simple life... He did it for me. Gods and mortals, BOTH male and female alike would gash themselves for a night with the Lord of the Sun, yet I knew he was MINE and he won me over in spite of me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the back of their necks his symbol appeared... I knew he would absorb the pain of the burn. He held both of them with ease... How many children had we had together?! I go inside to get dressed, but also to give him HIS time alone with them. He must also be thinking about his own twin sister, I can&#39;t wait to see her again but we must be careful, this would be the fifth time that Poseidon uses daevas among other creatures to find me... I look over where he is now on one of the couches by the fire pit where his laid with them telling tales of their own brother Hector, Prince of Troy and other heroes in Greek. I go an lay down next to him taking Jade in my arms so he could put his arm around us both to listen to the tales in his soothing voice.</p>
