                <p>chapters y&#39;all! And it was completely done synchronized and from what I heard there wasn&#39;t a single human casualty and the humans can&#39;t figure anything out because those buildings appear under ghost corporations they don&#39;t know of. The humans can&#39;t find any evidence AT ALL that links it to the supernatural world... It was a flawless victory! How will we be able to join them and not look the fools?&#34; Oh Marcus, that is not like you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Marcus, but foolish would be NOT to join them! If we have the shot that we do because Kayden is mate to Loiza, I say hell yeah we take it! We don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen now in the supernatural world, hell we don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going to happen in the human world now! Goddess knows this has triggered a major global chaos. We&#39;re sitting ducks in Virginia! The location of Karaya is unknown to humans and even if The Werewolf Council does have it and shares it, I doubt anyone in the supernatural world would risk it right now or EVER!&#34; Avis gives his opinion and he&#39;s on the mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s right! Marcus they&#39;re not the type to mock people. Scratch that they mock each other without a problem, but it&#39;s usually joking. When I was extremely ignorant of everything and I sat with Izz, she was patient and was explaining things nonchalantly. I don&#39;t remember her having any mocking tone at all, she did however say that if I kept questions that would actually keep me dumb. The Osupa have received people of our pack, Blue Moon and other packs which were not raised like they were and look what they achieved! For something like this to be done, every single man woman and child of the pack was needed Marcus... You&#39;ve already seen her mind, do you really think she will treat anybody who is sworn to her in such a way?&#34; Damn it Moira!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Alpha! The Lady Moira is at the shrine!&#39; FINALLY!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m on my way!&#39; I take a sip of water. Why am I so nervous? I&#39;ve already done this hundreds of times...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walk towards the shrine I noticed she wears a yellow cloak.. Very, very smart of you elf!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks at me with that Stone face of hers as I walk her way, who is she kidding with that face?! I remember when she was a baby! There was one time I used to think she was adorable! And here I have to keep a straight face knowing my dear brother in law tapped that! Ha!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you didn&#39;t bring my bow!&#34; Ares wouldn&#39;t have gotten this disrespect!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Kay---&#34; Ugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut the shit Moira! I&#39;m AWAKE! Who ELSE would send for you like that and you know not to fuck around!&#34; Yeah, like last time!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lord--&#34; My mind is all jumbled, I NEED her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nevermind take me to her at once! I want that Block down!&#34; NOW!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lord everything was done according to your contract with Gaia and Selene, I just need to look upon the symbol to move forward.&#34; I take off my shirt, I swear she always gets pleasure from this... And right on my shoulder below Loiza&#39;s Mark is my birthmark in red: a dot surrounded by a circle. MY symbol. Finally she kneels before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lor--&#34; Mate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care Moira, take me to her NOW!&#34; I NEED her scent!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks like she&#39;s in a conundrum. I&#39;m growling low at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WELL?&#34; After hundreds of times the small talk gets old and my patience grows thinner!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opens a portal and I link Marcus that I&#39;m going to negotiate with The Osupa... we are in The Fort but in the Betas&#39; office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait here My Lord, I shall get Bayoán. It&#39;s Morgana&#39;s spell.&#34; I recline against the window that looks out to Karayita.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then go! I&#39;ll be here.&#34; She runs out... That&#39;s better! I can already smell her, I can smell my pups. She&#39;s so tired, I&#39;ll take care of that at once! I can smell Bayoán on his way with Moira, where&#39;s Morgana? She can perform this after giving birth with no problems, one of my gifts to mortals is health! I have to be Kayden with Bayoán, she loves her family of this life, I know her enough that she won&#39;t give them up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden? Hey!&#34; He comes to me to shake my hand, who am I kidding? He was an asshole but he is devoted to his family and I know how much he loves my woman. What they did is impressive, even to a God!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayo!&#34; And I just go and hug the dumbass! And he is still with the excitement of his newborn son and them handing The Council their asses, goes ahead and hugs me back!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo! First congrats on the next Beta! And two! Holy fuck that was so bad ass! I felt it through her!&#34; His adrenaline still racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m still recovering! It was just all at once! We have never been in THIS level of harmony! Víctor walks in and he reads the air and I go to shake his hand and yet it&#39;s him this time he hugs me! And I notice I remember bits of last night, they ALL had contact, it wasn&#39;t just Filial, it was the ENTIRE ISLAND. It&#39;s SACRED, Hollowed land and they worship Gaia in her many forms, so they ALL feed from her power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Víctor you fucker! I FELT it! That was intense!&#34; They both had the happiest grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh man, I TOLD these idiots her brain is a scary place but NOW they understand! Yo Bayo! YOU should know how those assholes feel! You ALSO know what it feels like to have your ass handed to you by her!&#34; We laughed at that, I actually laughed! I CAN do this! I can be me again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Bayo: &#34;Dude I have been in her brain and trust me you don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re dealing with! And now that I do and did my homework I feel pretty good about it and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here! My Lady if you would!&#34; You BETTER make them let me see her now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Betas, we are here because it is time. Loiza&#39;s Block MUST come down NOW!&#34; They look at her as if she had lost her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lady believe me we are working on getting the block off but so suddenly? Are you sure about this?&#34; Bayoán asks her. I keep understanding why Selene loves these above all other werewolf packs, they&#39;re the ones who actually live by the rules of their prime animal. The animals she gave them, the spirit that resides within them. These above all respect and live cohesively with their wolf and its nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beta you must trust the will of the Goddess in this, the time has come this must be done!&#34; They look at each other apprehensively but as if instinctual as it is in a loyal pack they follow nature. And they accept the Blessings of the Goddesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right this way! Good luck man! If you guys can get over this and bring your pack over it will be better sooner rather than later. There&#39;s going to be chaos among the humans now, we don&#39;t want to imagine how the world is going to turn out right now. Here is the safest place! And she will need you for what is to come!&#34; Both of them escort Moira and myself to her rooms, I know she&#39;s asleep but I tell Moira to dismiss them I don&#39;t want to be disturbed. And she tells them to obey the Alpha&#39;s mate! Ha! I knew I would get something like that! I opened the double doors and it is as I saw in my mind&#39;s eye, she is asleep, she&#39;s so tired. But she needs to wake now, when she wakes we will be able to feed from each other like we always do. I&#39;m energized I can give her some of my life force right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I order Moira to wake her and she goes to my mate.</p>
