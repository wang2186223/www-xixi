                <p>Marcus&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where the fuck did Adam go?! Kayden and I went to the front where everyone is at. The buses with the pack from India are already empty and there&#39;s an enormous crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;They look in terrible condition, and the pups!&#39; I link Kayden. We usually made sure that the pups of the pack were safe and now that I met my niece and nephew I feel a little more sensitive towards it. I understand why Loiza would ask Kayden to keep quiet and why he would be on board, this place was becoming a haven and they were going to declare war. As Beta, security IS my main objective, I would have advised her likewise, ESPECIALLY when the pups are my own flesh and blood! Alpha twins product of two Alphas! Apparently it&#39;s not the first time for them, I would dare say that this is one of the oldest packs in The Americas and that long history allows them to have experience with many scenarios, so having records of two previous Alpha females allowed them to determine the best date for the war declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>K: &#39;I know... Now do you understand why we weren&#39;t a priority for The Osupa? We became one because they saw her stress and my desperation. We are here because the Event STILL has the world in a turmoil.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>M: I understand, I always understood that Kay, it was the feeling that I was loosing my brother to something we thought you had no power over. Do you think it was easy not just as your Beta, but as your brother, to watch you go down that path?! Kayden, I fucking had you on suicide watch after they left, I thought for a second that you were not going to come back. And then all of a sudden you had the soul searching experience and it totally blew me away, and then you are like a complete seesaw! Sometimes you&#39;d be really high and sometimes you would be very, very low. And we still haven&#39;t really come to terms with with what Keaton and Lydia did. I understand that they don&#39;t blame us and they are being very welcoming, but this is insane. The future Alpha of this pack is between those two pups, sigh... I understand the why brother. Can we not keep secrets from each other anymore?&#39; He looked taken aback but nodded in agreement. &#39;Thank you. Remember twat, you&#39;re all I&#39;ve got left!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>K: &#39;You also have a family and a pack Marcus! They treat each other&#39;s mates as blood. You should meet Antoine, he had no one and just by being with ONE of them he got them ALL. You saw in the video that originally Izz wanted it be YOU to be liaison so you could bond with the pups. But I chose Jason because I NEEDED you, I still would have made the choice regardless of the pups... For me to get them again I needed YOU to ground me. Understood?!&#39; I guess we&#39;ll see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We meet up with Nina, Antoine, Ura, Freya, the Beta from India and that girl from London, that is almost identical to Loiza except for her eyes which were deep indigo blue, her cousin I think, they could pass for twins! And I see she has a fresh Mark, the Beta from India...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the hold up?&#34; Kayden asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meh! This is standard bro, especially with Phoebe and Jana rounding up this rodeo! What&#39;s up Marcus? You should have told your brother to fuck off and left someone else in charge and you should have hanged out with us yesterday! We should have Circle night now that Talia is here! Lola, where did she and Umbros go?&#34; Circle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Circle?&#39; I ask him. He just waved it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You&#39;ll see... Nina&#39;s giving you the invite! You&#39;ll love it, trust me!&#39; Asshole gives me a huge grin with two thumbs up...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina, seriously don&#39;t you know our routines coming from these by now?! As much as Umbros loves to bitch about us, he sure learned to behave like us! I would be long gone if it wasn&#39;t for Ishaan... How are you feeling Papi?&#34; He actually looks in good spirits!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you fucking kidding me?! Yeah it was almost impossible, but now that we are here and I have you, I feel better. Fuck Darpan! How many had to die for his stupidity?!&#34; He&#39;s about my size, with flowy black hair almost to his shoulders, black eyes and bronze skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are instructed to go in the throne room and holy fuck! The huge room is round! The round walls had mosaics of seafaring searches, running wolves, old hieroglyphs with different symbols that I imagine are significant to The Osupa! Loiza sat on a wooden bench with wolf heads roaring at the sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing is to see the progress of the braid, another to see the end product! I had never imagined that we had anything like this in the warewolf world! She was flanked by the fae/elf girl with purple pixie cut hair in a simple purple gown, her wings in display, on her right and her other Beta, a beautiful girl with long braids in her hair in a tailored suit and Beta Shomari next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat with her hands at her lap, fingers interlocked. She was dressed in a long purple sleeveless dress, with intricate ropes of the same fabric held it to her long neck crisscrossing in the back. Around her right arm a gold band with wolf heads at the end one going up, another down. Every finger had a plain gold ring, and gold beads with runes were scattered throughout her braid and the gold medallion that states her position of power among her people around her neck. I could now see her arms now that the robe she wore earlier doesn&#39;t cover them. She has a tattoo in each arm that goes down as a ribbon with runes and symbols inside ending with beautiful mandalas on top of her hands. She truly did officially look like a queen from antiquity! For those of our people who were able to come inside the throne room, throughout our link people were in awe and sending information of the vision to those outside. And from what I&#39;m seeing from the other pack they&#39;re doing the same. Well Keaton and Lydia both did say this place was on another level! At least on that they spoke truth...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After we&#39;re all inside Kayden, myself and Beta Ishaan go to a platform on the second tier landing of stairs going to the throne. And she stands erect, she&#39;s emanating a strong aura to demonstrate her power and dominance to ensure our submission... It&#39;s overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We welcome you all on this happy day! Not only were we able to best our enemy together as one unit as we should always be, we have redeemed our vengeance! With the harmony we have achieved, our new brothers and sisters from India were able to arrive as safely as possible! Also because of the worldwide chaos we were able to achieve a goal that we long wanted to rest our heavy heart. My mate has come to be by my side as the Goddess intended, he has brought his own people to join ours so that we all shall be one! Blessed Be the Goddesses&#39;s Mercy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blessed Be!&#34; Everyone repeats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ceremony proceeds with her blood letting... I&#39;m feeling impatient now! And I&#39;m loosing focus, Wilk is alert! My heart starts thumping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>K: &#39;Marcus, what&#39;s wrong?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>M: &#39;I don&#39;t know brother, just keep me focused, we are almost done right?!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>K: &#39;Yeah, just focus on drinking from the chalice and saying the words and we&#39;re clear, ok Marc?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>M: &#39;Yeah gotcha!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a drink and pass it on so everyone can and focus on the words when it&#39;s time. And we are in The Osupa Link... We were bombarded by thousands of welcomes and outpour of love towards all of us! This isn&#39;t a Link, it&#39;s a Network and it&#39;s a lot the first minutes... then we hear the hum... They are helping us integrate easier by helping our brains sync with theirs. I look at Leo looking flushed and suddenly... A collective breath of harmony and we all breathe with them. Kayden looked back at everyone...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you all ok? How are you feeling?&#34; I&#39;m already feeling very well, better than well. I feel their peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is amazing!&#34; &#34;Do you feel them?&#34; &#34;Hey I got in contact with Helena!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright guys head out! Their going to help with getting you settled!&#34; Kayden bellowed. He goes up the stairs to where Loiza is and puts out his hand for her, she kisses his lips and takes his arm. He escorts her towards the exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m finally IN! She looks like a vision and delivered beautifully, Blood Moon can&#39;t even believe a place like this existed for our people and when they saw her they finally understood that she could never be a Luna! Everyone who left with The Osupa are welcoming us along with the rest of the tribe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I&#39;m escorting my woman outside where Luna Isla and her team are tending to her people. Before we leave the court yard, out of nowhere someone tackles Marcus to the floor, pinning him down and planting a kiss on his lips! &#34;You sure took your damn sweet time mate! How rude of you for making me wait! But don&#39;t worry I forgive you!&#34; A ligh copper skinned, slender yet tone girl with black hair cut in a bob with low bangs and sapphire eyes keeps Marcus pinned and kisses him more deeply now. Marcus just wraps his arms around her waist letting her have her way with him... Ooookaaay well that just happened!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NATALIA! WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING?!&#34; Izz shouts at her cousin, well I guess he&#39;ll be in a good mood! Izzy facepalms herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I found my mate Izzy! Isn&#39;t he cute? I can&#39;t wait to finally play with him!&#34; And Marcus is brimming! And I nudge him with my foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No SHIT Talia! Have you even let him get a word in?&#34; The others come over and Ura and Freya start laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck off Izzy! You get to play with yours but I don&#39;t get to have MY fun?!&#34; And Izz pushes me gently and with the wave of her hand pours some water from the pool on the both of them! &#34;You better cool down cousin, just take him to your rooms at least! Marcus I&#39;m SO SORRY but you have no idea what you&#39;re in for!&#34; The Warrior who was true mate to Logan&#39;s wife comes up, laughing at the show with the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cacique will you be needing anything else from us?&#34; And she opens her eyes with her hand still on her forehead... &#34;No Sibo, go home and remember that you are on leave starting tomorrow. The Betas already have your papers ready, congratulations and good luck!&#34; On leave? I look at her memories... Diana is pregnant with a LITTER of three! She wasn&#39;t barren at all, she just needed her true mate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;FINE! Come mate I can smell you&#39;re a virgin and it&#39;s spiking my creativity! And she lifts him up up from the floor and drags him to the left walk way and up a stair way to who knows where! &#39;Brother will you be ok?&#39; I link him. &#39;I have a very strong feeling that I will! See you later, don&#39;t wait for me!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loiza has her hand on her forehead like she has a migraine, I wrap my arms around her. &#34;Don&#39;t worry love, he&#39;ll be fine, he&#39;s happy!&#34; And they all give me a look and suddenly Freya and Ura can&#39;t stop laughing again, now with Lola and Nina joining in.</p>
