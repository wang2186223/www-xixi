                <p>Antoine&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m an only child! I knew my beautiful mate was a Hellraiser before, yet I can feel how devastated she feels of actually having to hear it from those she loves the most that she WAS bringing hell to them. It&#39;s so hard as a mate to feel that pain from her, her regret, I can just be there for her... This is not an attack from the outside, this is something she caused herself and I don&#39;t intend to lash out to my Alpha and now family for her. I will give her anything she needs and wants from me but she&#39;s going to have to fess up to this and I&#39;m already feeling in our Bond that she realizes this... Much to my relief! Nina is selfish, superficial, she is even cruel at times. But it&#39;s mostly just the farce... She is what the Chinese call a paper tiger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After being mated with her these past months, I understand why I was paired with her. She and I were exactly the same, I was VERY selfish too. I was extremely careless with my pack... I was focused on my lust that I almost cost the lives of thousands. What the hell was I thinking? When Natalie came with her proposal I gave thanks to the Goddess for her mercy and then Mt. Cemí blew and our pact was up in the air. Cesar had his own problems in Sardinia, damn those connards in The Council! Even if I did cause a rift --- merde... I really have no excuse!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the deal was again approved by the new Alpha, a girl of 19 we were shocked that The Mighty Osupa accepted such a young girl to lead them. For a moment Cesar and I thought of backing out and doing a last stand in Sardinia. But Natalie told us we were LUCKY, and better off with Loiza as Alpha than Gúarionex! Cesar and I thought she was mad! Besides, Loiza would still have to deal with the chaos that The Osupa were going through. Natalie, Lola and Umbros were my guests those months, yet even with everything their own people were going through none of them seemed worried. They were devastated about what happened and I do know that they were basically mourning Ayiti who they thought had perished, and yet when there was an attack they stood by us as our BEST Warriors, I would sometimes not believe what I was seeing! When Cesar and I decided that I would trek to Sardinia I called Natalie to my office... I used to have an office! Ha! Good riddance!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, I am moving the pack to Sardinia. I think you should worry about your own pack ---&#34; She started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would I worry about my pack?! We are Osupa, we have survived worse and now that Loiza is Cacique we will soon be on the rise! My mission is HERE, you&#39;re pack is at risk and if Sardinia is where you want to go then we will be your escorts! We will keep you safe! I know my cousin, the Goddess herself has crowned her not just Alpha but Cacique of our people, she is a very powerful Priestess of the Goddess who fought against the mountain, she fought against two OSUPA Betas in fair combat without her elemental powers and handed their asses to them! Her veins flows with Alpha blood, her mother was even more powerful than Gúarionex. Our pack is in EXCELLENT hands, I&#39;m worried about YOU guys!&#34; I was STUNNED of how SURE she was and how much faith she had on this girl. She showed me this combat with TWO Betas... And she was younger then. I don&#39;t know if it was the fact that they were so sure, and then we found out that they had regained their territory again so easily which changed Caesar&#39;s and my mind. Last time we spoke when we had breakfast before training, we both were extremely happy we took the deal!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, we&#39;re HERE! Are you ready?!&#34; My mischievous mate! How did I live before her? I notice when she goes to the shrines to give thanks, I wonder if she notices when I go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Goddess Nina it&#39;s just a fucking sex toy shop not a weekend in Vegas! Tony man you&#39;re going to going to have to give it to her harder if she&#39;s this excited over with some toys!&#34; The girl that I was so doubtful of... What an imbecile. Instead of surviving everyday my people are thriving under her rule... She asks for my counsel sometimes and yet, every single time she makes it look so EASY, even though as part of The Circle I know how doubtful she is of herself... It puts me to shame sometimes, I was doubting her and she is the one who has proven to be a TRUE Alpha... Sigh... I&#39;m afraid she&#39;s going to kick my ass in training. I hope she goes easy on me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you sure can be ungrateful! Mi amor give me a minute... Izz, Frey this is my favorite section over here! I&#39;m so glad that they put everything as it was!&#34; The girls went ahead, it&#39;s a pretty big store, I go with Ura to check out the oils. The Osupa Masters are no joke with their creations, the best part of my day is when my little Hellraiser kisses me before stripping me and drenches me in oils to speed my regeneration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry you had to see that man, that&#39;s actually my bad, too. Izzy has been telling me for years to speak my mind, even if it&#39;s a little but I never did and she&#39;s not the type to nag every chance she gets. I blew up... It&#39;ll be fine and Izzy is not one to hold grudges... I already unpacked almost everything.&#34; He passed his hand down his face trying to wipe off his stress. Meeting my mate is forever going to be the best day of my life... Getting a family, living in this peaceful paradise, their training... It was a jackpot bonus! But when Nina told me about The Circle and I saw through her eyes what it was I didn&#39;t know if I was able to be that intimate with her family... she basically ordered me to go the first time! Ha! Ma Déesse, never has a woman dared ordered me around and this Kappa does what she wants with me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Antoine Beaumont as your fucking mate I ORDER you to come with me or Goddess help me you can get your damn ass back to France and sit on the fucking Eiffel Tower!&#39; She has such a way with words... I know she didn&#39;t mean it, but she did spit enough venom to make me cautious, I am very well aware of how unpredictable she can be, Goddess knows how she could pay me back and I didn&#39;t really want to find out. I&#39;m glad she did though. I know that what happened today was something that Ura and even Izzy really needed, and I can imagine how as his Twin Soul even Freya must have felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ura don&#39;t be sorry, I actually agree with Izzy, this is a good thing, you have vented and Nina has taken responsibility, and believe me... She feels like shit and she knows this is on HER. I know you love all your sisters, I know Nina is special to you, but I know that you and Izzy share the most intimate bond between the lot of you. It&#39;s a good first step for you guys to heal this wound. I&#39;m just kicking myself because my question is what riled you up.&#34; He tries to say something. But there&#39;s no need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ura it&#39;s fine, Nina will man up to her mistake. The funny thing is that I never met your father and yet in her own eyes, in her own memories... I think she is the most ALIKE to your father, I think that&#39;s why they clashed so much.&#34; I got some oils I know she will like the scent, I let her boss me around if it makes her happy, she treats me so good... I have never felt so wanted, needed and loved by anyone and then she thought me how to be happy again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think so?&#34; He&#39;s such a good guy, I am really lucky to have gotten a brother like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about it... Stubborn as mules, prejudiced, prideful, conceited and arrogant... Yet creative, opinionated and full of regrets. Now that I go to therapy I see why you guys see it&#39;s importance... As a Beta, you&#39;re father should have been more assertive and notice that the rifts within his own family that could fully tear in the future. He should have made sure you had family counseling.&#34; We are already at the counter. Ura stays quiet, I know he took in everything I said and is buried in his thoughts. I pat his shoulder as the girls come over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe I have some fun stuff for later!&#34; Ura smiles as Freya goes to him with two boxes kissing him deeply, he wraps his arms around her waist and kisses her even deeper. Ura speaks so little and outside The Circle I know he speaks less, it&#39;s a good thing Freya and him are Twin Souls, unless he prohibits it, she will voice anything he&#39;s thinking and he really is not the type to prohibit Frey from anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I think I got everything I need for now! Nina are you sure this should be enough?&#34; She just throws a bunch of boxes on the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough?! I already told you this, this, this and that is enough! Hades Izzy! Do you want to carry their babies too?!&#34; I am trying so hard to not laugh, by the Goddess&#39;s mercy the woman is not one to filter her words! Izzy is studying the articles again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meh! I still want to try them all!&#34; She says shrugging. It&#39;s so funny because she&#39;s pretty scary... What I&#39;ve seen her do! Uff! I have NEVER seen any Alpha do what she can. Just what she did to The Council when she declared war on them, we have had no retaliation! At least not Karaya and they&#39;re just doing what they were doing before, attacking those who are not to their standards... Cowards. And yet I understand why her and Ura are thick as thieves, they try their best to not allow to be bothered by others and are really laid back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine wrap it all up, Frey lay yours down ma chérie... Mon amour, did you get anything you want?&#34; I stretch my hand to her, might as well try to make her look at least a little humble. She takes my hand and wraps herself in my arm like it&#39;s a dance move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope! I already did!&#34; And gets on her toes and gives me a sweet kiss on my cheek, this woman always knows how to get my mood in the clouds with her mischief but I&#39;m not letting her get away so easily, I KNOW she owes Maco a ton of money and the others are pissed about it but they keep their mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are so sweet sometimes chèri... Go on and pay, I got some new oils I think you&#39;ll like.&#34; She gives me a look but she smiles at me... My paper tiger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Riiiiiiight! Josián, put it on my tab please... I guess my name is &#39;Payback&#39; today.&#34; Good girl!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Nina you are the bestest big sister ever! Ura aren&#39;t you curious where she&#39;s going to take us to lunch?!&#34; Izzy states and I can&#39;t help it this time and apparently Frey can&#39;t either because we just bust out laughing! That was straight up upper cut! Ura goes to the counter and leans on it next to Izzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am extremely curious! Buuuut I have a hunch she&#39;s taking us to Ramiro&#39;s place and then maybe to Kike&#39;s show you that you wanted to watch... It&#39;s a hunch but I just KNOW our sister is just that generous!&#34; Oh man! Their good. Freya and I look at each other and she just put her hands over her mouth, the tears in her eyes spilling out and she comes by my side trying to get shelter from the shit show!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, you mother fuckers are really laying it on thick aren&#39;t cha?! Let me tell yo---&#34; I pinch one of her butt cheeks making her yelp and she glares at me and I rise one of my eyebrows. For fucks sake woman just do it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I - It would be my greatest pleasure to invite you guys to Ramiro&#39;s and wherever...&#34; Atta girl!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn Ura! You&#39;re right! Did you get Seer powers and didn&#39;t tell me?! She IS generous! She reminds me so much of Maco, I have a feeling that she&#39;ll be very generous to Maco in the future, too!&#34; I don&#39;t know if I will be able to contain Nina all day if this keeps up!</p>
