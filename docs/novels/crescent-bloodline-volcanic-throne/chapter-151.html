                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to where I scent Marcus for an update before going to pack. The pack looked like a bee hive, and as I reached my brother I see the queen bee herself... Grandmother! She really doesn&#39;t give a fuck anymore, she didn&#39;t even change her name! I wanted to take her in my arms and hug her, but I don&#39;t know how awake she is. If it wasn&#39;t for the help she bestowed upon our mother, Artemis and I wouldn&#39;t have survived Hera&#39;s scorn... HERA! She is allied to us... Kinda! The irony!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t ACTIVELY help us... But when I couldn&#39;t take anymore of Poseidon&#39;s abuse toward MY WOMAN! The mother of my beloved children I finally snapped!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked dead when I saw her lying on the mosaic floor of the rooms that belonged to Hector in the ruins of Troy... He wasn&#39;t her son, he was my last son with a woman that wasn&#39;t her... Yet she and Artemis dotted on him! Artemis had her beloved Amazons gift The Troyans thousands of horses making it their symbol and gave Hector the ability to master them as the Amazons did. Phi gifted him with the ability to listen to the humpback whales and heed the dolphins. She always made sure the Waters of Troy we&#39;re almost infested by them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Always listen to them Prince of Troy, if danger comes by way of the sea they will give you a weeks warning... Hector this way you&#39;ll never be attacked by surprise from the shore do you understand brave boy!!&#34; She had gifted him SONAR! If it wasn&#39;t for her gift they would&#39;ve been unprepared. The war probably wouldn&#39;t have lasted for 10 years. Troy would have probably been destroyed immediately. She gave them a fighting chance... They were destroyed anyway, and still her and Artemis, thick as thieves as always, stole Andromache and my grandson away to safety... Our sister Helen refused to leave Paris... so strong was Aphrodite&#39;s spell, it killed them both in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up her broken, bloody body from the floor, her eyes looked dead. I was DONE! I took her to my stepmother whom I knew despised me, but she IS Goddess of marriage and family. She stood from her throne of gold and silver peacock feathers as I laid Phi at her feet and I knelt to her in submission. She was furious when Zeus gave Phi to his brother... she HERSELF had Blessed our promise of marriage... Hera was actually very fond of Phi and would visit her from time to time as long as grandmother wasn&#39;t with her. Father tried his bullshit on Phi going to her as an Orca to attract her... It had the opposite effect, she was LIVID that he had DARED use her precious animals to try to manipulate her! So she prayed to Hera for protection and Hera intervened... That was almost a century before I met her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Goddess went to the floor to her as I was healing her...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this the first time he has done this to her Brat?!&#34; She REALLY loved calling me that, but I was looking for her help so I bit my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Father be DAMNED! I fucking told her EVERYTHING! Needless to say she was outraged, she wanted to vent her wrath not just on my father, but Poseidon as well, but she knew that if she did, they would find her and he would just drag her back. She hid us away and fed Phi much needed Ambrosia. Once she was well, enough she had Hades come fetch for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen here Brat! You will NEVER mention this to your father, he and Poseidon must never know I had anything to do with your disappearance. Do you understand me bastard!&#34; Again I bit my tongue, THIS was more than I ever hoped from her. She can diss me all she wants if it makes her happy, I STILL will be grateful to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you command, Queen of Olympus.&#34; On my knees I agreed to her demand. She smiled at that... It must have been satisfying for her to see me at her feet and hear those words from my mouth. I really didn&#39;t give a DAMN anymore... I have to double check with Izz her relationship with Hera. We will continue to remember everything in the coming weeks and months, our wolves helping us channel the information as a buffer for our mortal minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was about time you showed up bother! the Lady Phoebe, the Lady Yaya and other Priestesses are checking everyone through and through and once they have been approved they are granted time to go home and pack and Joey and her group are figuring out a way to get us out of here!&#34; Marcus looks excited!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had things to take care of Marcus, but everything is set! Is everyone checking out My Lady? And I do want to take this moment to apologize for what happened to you in my pack.&#34; I tell my grandmother watching closely to see if she gives me a signal. Instead she gives me a long look... Seriously?! I KNOW you can READ me grandmother! She gives me a smile. She looks at Marcus and then back at me... She&#39;s awake or in that process!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can let bygones be bygones Alpha! In life we all suffer from a moment of brief stupidity.&#34; She says with a brimming smile! Gee, thanks Nana...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed My Lady, I hope yours to be as brief as my own.&#34; She lets out a laugh and Marcus is putting up a still face but I know he&#39;s a little lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right you are lad! Now I inform you Alpha, you have done a fine job with your pack since last I was here! Cheers to you! And to be honest we haven&#39;t found anything that would concern us. However, there are a few ladies that have given out personal information about you to people from OUTSIDE, it&#39;s really harmless information but I think you should speak with them and explain that this will not just very frowned upon where they&#39;re going, but considered treason and the price for treason is death! Especially since the events of this morning... The pack Is in tune that disloyalty shall be frown upon by the pack. As you well know, certain information rides like wildfire inside Karaya, and while it burns within, The Osupa do not tolerate that fire spreading to outsiders. I hope you understand my meaning and the importance of this conversation with them, correct?&#34; Son of a bitch! That&#39;s the last thing I wanted to do right this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I must hand it to her, she explained everything in a way that I totally understood it and also hinted that she was indeed awake but still just in the process. Grandmother is extremely gifted with knowledge but she is not of water and she doesn&#39;t have a mate that is of water that can help awaken her faster. That&#39;s why she usually chooses fae as her vessel, they live such long lives that she doesn&#39;t have to go through the process over and over again. It just so happens she&#39;s starting her new cycle ride along with us, but I like the look she has now! Her genetics actually allowed her to have wings, she&#39;s always wanted those! And if she was sold by Marius to Vanessa in my pack it means she was already looking for me, her nose was already on the scent. I hope all three of us can speak tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh... &#34;I understand clearly My Lady! Do you have the names of the ladies?&#34; I&#39;m rubbing my eyes already bothered of having to deal with this nuisance at this very moment. Either way I&#39;m glad that I can be with my son to guide him through this so he doesn&#39;t make a fool of himself! I don&#39;t want Phi to know that I have a feeling that Selene wants Jade. That&#39;s going to be very hard for her to hear, I&#39;m already pissed about it! I need to block that part of our Bond immediately, she will know when she knows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What in Hades did we negotiate for this lifetime that we&#39;re paying such a high price?! I even took this into consideration when I gave them my own Blessing... To make it easier on my daughter I made sure she was of water like her mother, I&#39;ll have to speak with Pasha further on so she doesn&#39;t tell Izzy that Jade now smells exactly like her underwater. To my son I made sure my fire was strong in him... He will need it. What Gaia wants us to achieve is something he will have to learn to rule, and I don&#39;t know how large she wants this Empire of hers. I&#39;m already thinking of the methods I helped Hector with and taking into consideration the mistakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus passed me the tablet with the four names and I asked him to send them to my office and to have coffee brought up. Come on poet let&#39;s charm them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked in Gemma, Lisa, Miriam and Delilah looked over a little nervously... I couldn&#39;t help but click my tongue a few times, yeah I can&#39;t allow Deacon to be in this situation...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ladies! Are you excited for the move?&#34; Act one. They looked a little nervous but I could feel excitement from them from the link and it wasn&#39;t over my gorgeous self! So far so good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually Alpha, some of us had already prepared ourselves a bit!&#34; Lisa said. Yeah it got uncomfortable really fast with her. The first few times was always fun but then the getting to know each other part became bothersome. It reminded me of how I was when I was young before I met her. I just wouldn&#39;t care or if I did it was just a little bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awesome! Look guys the reason I am calling you here is because, yeah I know you guys blabbed your mouth about something between us to somebody from outside. There&#39;s no need to hide it, The Osupa are extremely good at this! And they don&#39;t care... It&#39;s fine, gossip is like a national sport to them! But it has to stay INSIDE the pack! If you blab your mouth to anybody from the outside, they&#39;re not messing around it&#39;s game over. To them it&#39;s treason and treason is punishable by death! Do you guys understand? I don&#39;t know what you guys said and I don&#39;t care, for real, but I do want you to understand the consequences of doing it in another pack. I guarantee you guys are going to love the lifestyle but that is one thing that&#39;s a big no no to them. Capiche?!&#34; They looked at each other clearly embarrassed, I was embarrassed! I truly hope they all find their mates!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; &#34;Yes Kayden.&#34; &#34;Capiche.&#34; &#34;Crystal.&#34; Excellent! On to Act 2.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right guys finish packing, let&#39;s see if we get Airborne ASAP! Remember we&#39;re still using the same distractions they used to extract the pack from India to get out ourselves. So head out!&#34; They seem calm, it&#39;s fine it&#39;s no big deal anyway. I understand better why Bayoán said that The Council was not an issue for them! Yeah no shit! They stand up to leave. Before she hits the door...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo Delilah...&#34; She looks back while the others continue. &#34;... For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m sorry, I hope you can find your own path.&#34; She was thoughtful for a minute and just started to nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will... This seems like a very big</p>
