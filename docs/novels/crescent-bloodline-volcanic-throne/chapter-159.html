                <p>I&#39;m so tired, I can&#39;t wait to soak in a very long, very warm bath. This mission was HELL! Tali and her non stop talking about any stupid shit that comes out her mouth and Lola... Ugh! Now that she found her mate is unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hope to never find mine... I have always been worried about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a Truth Seer I do know when people are spouting bullshit, but sometimes people don&#39;t have to lie to you to hurt you. Goddess I hope I don&#39;t meet anyone on my way to my rooms, I usually just want to be alone for a few days after. Everyone in the bus is chatting away, Tali talking with Lola and her mate Beta Ishaan, I look as Lola is still trying to comfort him and it seems to work. She&#39;s always been VERY good with men...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to give it to the guy... What he did must have taken every once of his will to do. I don&#39;t blame him... He has a large family to protect with many pups. I have a complicated relationship with my own family, especially my sisters, but I&#39;ll be damned if anyone dares mess with any of them! And just to imagine them in the circumstances Chandrama was just churns my stomach. I still haven&#39;t seen Ura&#39;s or Bayo&#39;s pups, but I still remember the scent of Izzy&#39;s twins, it&#39;s such a refreshing scent... Gogh, my wolf, couldn&#39;t help but whimper when we met them. I wouldn&#39;t have imagined Izz to be the first of us to have pups, one minute Morgana is the token family prego and Izzy and Ura, switch the nitro! Um, bad analogy... Last time I switched the nitro in a car race three other cars were destroyed. Ugh! Why do I suck so badly at it?! I haven&#39;t driven since.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finally reach The Fort and just as I&#39;m going to bolt out to head straight up to my room it hits me... Coffee and fresh cut grass! FUCK! Keep it together dork! Gogh is already pissed at me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;At least take mate to the room to talk dickwad!&#39; Shit... Ok it&#39;s now or never! I get off the bus and he is right by the entrance... My heart is racing! He&#39;s beautiful! Blonde sun kissed hair, bright honey colored eyes and his lips... I go to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Follow me.&#34; I tell him calmly yet it did sound cold, and I&#39;m instantly regretting it... DAMN it! I feel him follow me to my room on the 5th floor facing the lagoon. I close the door, raise the sound barrier and drop my bag and put my tomahawk on the dresser taking a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for my tone mate, I was fearful of this day.&#34; I can tell he wants more than talking, he&#39;s also a Gamma... &#34;My name is Umbros, what&#39;s yours?&#34; I was fearful of this day... I knew that when it did, what I&#39;ve been hiding would be revealed and that it couldn&#39;t be helped. I already feel like just his scent is imperative for my existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You FEARED me Umbros? You don&#39;t have to fear me Love, my name is Adam.&#34; He says with a smirk. And I feel him caress my ear with his lips... I let the goosebumps show. Oh my beautiful mate, I can&#39;t fear you. I look at him and take him in... He is hard and ready to be mine. I smile at his erection, his size looks perfect! And I am using everything to fucking control my dick, it seems to frustrate him... He, he! Impatient are we? I go to him and he&#39;s now not looking as cocky... I can scent his fear of rejection. That&#39;s not going to happen, but I need time to accept this myself. Unlike Nina, my escapades have always been PRIVATE and usually reserved for The District where confidentiality is guaranteed. As I get closer I caress his lips... Damn they&#39;re juicy! I kiss them to get a taste... Perfect. I feel his wolf Rune purring, he deepens the kiss and I stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t fear YOU Adam. Do you want something to drink? Let&#39;s have a chat, please sit wherever you want.&#34; He&#39;s a little confused and nervous again, I go to one of my drawers where I usually already have some joints rolled up and light one up and go to the fridge in the back of my closet and grab two beers and hand him one. I pass him the joint and kiss his neck where I want to Mark him, I take his hand and lead him to the balcony and take a sip of beer. I sit down on the couch and signal for him to join me. He takes a hit and a sip and sits next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do YOU fear me Adam?&#34; And I&#39;ll know if you lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t fear you Umbros, it&#39;s just that... Um...&#34; He&#39;s adorable!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s change the question... Does your family know? Your friends? Your pack?&#34; He looks taken aback by the question. Goddess I want to jump him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... I guess I...&#34; I kiss his lips again... I want to remind him I&#39;m his mate regardless. I want to make sure that he&#39;s gone through everything in his mind... Like I have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adam have you ever thought what would happen if this day ever came? Believe me beautiful, I HAVE... MANY times.&#34; He looks like he&#39;s in a conundrum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, not really. I have been with women, but...&#34; He takes another hit, good I want him relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... You didn&#39;t think on the AFTER Love?&#34; His hair cascades short wisps over his eyes and I tuck some back kissing his temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess not... FUCK!&#34; Whoa easy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adam, it&#39;s just US right now, do you understand? Relax baby, ok? Here take another hit and pass it over.&#34; He obeyed... My self control is at its peak. I&#39;m already feeling I&#39;m getting hard... shit... I don&#39;t even have Jading potion! He looks a little gloomy... It hurts. I take a deep hit and another sip. I lift his eyes to meet mine and caress his chin with my thumb. I see him shiver...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how do you want to go about this Adam? I&#39;m not going to reject you, I WANT YOU! But I&#39;m in the same boat. I&#39;ve never told my family and I really don&#39;t have many friends. I&#39;ve never been with a woman, I&#39;ve never had to. I would just enjoy myself in The District. Do you want ME?&#34; Now I&#39;m the one nervous, if I have him, I just might be able to do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adam&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>SHIT! He&#39;s right! I didn&#39;t EVER think this through! What would my brother say?! The guys?! I stand up and rub my face... I definitely DO WANT HIM! And I&#39;m hard again... He is GORGEOUS! Damn his skin is like cooper, his hair is as black as coal in a mohawk, his hair in front framing his really dark sapphire eyes that almost look black, and the rest in a long braid, he looks like something out of a western, I saw that he even did have a tomahawk! He is fine as fuck! He&#39;s just a little bit taller than me and I&#39;m 6&#39;2&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used to have a crush on Marcus, but I never dared say anything and when they started being all girl crazy... I went along. He&#39;s though through everything and is giving me the chance to be SURE before going forward... &#39;He won&#39;t reject us! He WANTS US! Take him!&#39; Rune commands me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about this Adam... You go back with your family, get in the pack and we can go slow, or you can go ahead and reject me.&#34; WHAT? NO!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO! Please don&#39;t mention that again Umbros!&#34; I kneel before him and put my head on his lap he runs his fingers through my hair. I can&#39;t help but close my eyes at the welcomed touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I said Love, I won&#39;t EVER reject you. I leave it in your hands... To be honest I was thinking about tasting you but not Marking your beautiful self Mi Amor... to give you time to REALLY think about it, yet...&#34; He takes my face in his hands and kisses me again making my damn ball sack throb! Yet? Yet what?! Oh my Goddess, Spanish! He&#39;s so sexy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet?&#34; I need to know!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... Yet I don&#39;t know that I will be able to contain Gogh once I unleash him upon you!&#34; I start feeling him getting hard! Finally! I don&#39;t give a shit anymore. I grind my lips to his erection making him take off his shirt and whoa...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me NOW baby? Remember what I told you, once we start it will be very hard to stop, if you don&#39;t want me to Mark you I need to know NOW!&#34; And his eyes turn black making me gulp. He&#39;s leaving EVERY choice up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umbros... How about you? You won&#39;t mind my Mark?&#34; I kiss one of I don&#39;t know how many abs now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;VERY much so! If you don&#39;t Mark me I WILL mind it VERY MUCH! That&#39;s why I want to know what YOU want Adam.&#34; What I want... I don&#39;t want to hurt him and I feel I will hurt if he&#39;s not with me. I go ahead and unbutton his jeans... Goddess help me, I want him SO MUCH!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want your Mark Umbros... I wan--&#34; He didn&#39;t let me finish before kissing me hard and makes us stand, taking off my shirt, his pants and he turns me around and pushes himself against me... My heart can&#39;t stop pounding, I take off my pants and he grinds his hardness against my crack and he starts jerking me off his hands already wet with lube! Holy shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have only been with two men and they were human, I had control of them! Him taking charge is driving me crazy! He kept stroking me better than I stroke myself! I try to touch him, but he doesn&#39;t let me, FUUUCK! I spill over on the floor and he takes a drop to his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You taste delicious Love...&#34; He kissed me gently and tenderly and I tasted myself in his mouth, I wanted to live there. I&#39;m still hard as fuck! He notices my surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry Cariño, we&#39;ve only started, you WILL BE MINE ADAM!&#34; Oh man! I already LOVE my new home!</p>
