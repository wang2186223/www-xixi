                <p>Loiza POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finally got the news that the boats are here, but going to Uguaca Bay was unnecessary since the docks at Itiba were cleared completely. Still the construction on the Northeast shore was moving at a rapid pace, having a combination of strong warewolves, powerful Priestesses, other beings that have access to magic and our now up and running technology will achieve that. In fact there&#39;s barely any indication that we were attached at all thanks to the speed Avalon is working, Moira sent out more Priestesses since the war declaration date had been moved to February.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had ordered that the new Osupa members be able to learn to enjoy life and heal before they were initiated into what their designations were going to be. The escapees from Blood Moon however were ready to go since they had neither been enslaved or ravished by war and since most were Omegas and Chis they started to be trained at the hospital to see what skills they had. Yet many brought their mates who were Warriors and of other varying ranks. Braka assigned Bruno with the training of the Warriors and because of the medical care and varying physical therapy they were receiving, they were very enthusiastic about the more strenuous and change of pace training making them stronger and even learned how to shift faster when they discovered how to make their bones nimble for the shift making them not feel discomfort, let alone pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Ximena and Isaura were in charge of my daily look I have to admit I was looking damn good! Isla was right, yet there were days like today that all that formal attire was not necessary. Today was our people returning after weeks at sea, I could feel both the excitement and sorrow for those returning and those lost. So I just jumped in a pair of jeans and a black tank top with simple leather sandals, Isaura insisted I wear the Queens Braid and Ximena said I will wear The Guanín: &#34;They know you Alpha but they have not seen you in a while, they know you as a Priestess not as an Alpha.&#34; Isaura said while braiding my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were all at the docks waiting to receive them with everything ready for anything they might need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The now Admiral Casimar was the first to come down looking as dashing as ever and Cleo and their mother couldn&#39;t help but run to him and his brothers. I could tell Braka was excited and proud to see him but he kept his composure and greeted him formally, presenting Helena to them. Yet nothing could prepare us for Tia Ayiti coming down one of the platforms! She was among the missing and thought to be among the dead that were being found daily and identified through DNA analisis since most were charred bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, Ura, Nia and I go running to her, Nia being the fastest and lightest on her feet, Epsilon through and through got to her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;TÍA! We thought you were dead!&#34; Ura picks her up in a bone crushing hug. And she hugs them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tía, where on Earth were you?! We had lost hope.&#34; I hug her and take I her scent so close to that of father&#39;s. Nina just shoved me out of the way so she could get her turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well if I would have known that I would get such a welcome I would have swam back! And she looks at me and takes my shoulders in her hands: &#34;I am so proud of you mija, and I am sure your parents are too, when Casimar found me he told me all about what you have done. With all that work you have put in you were meant for great things.&#34; I just hug her, I don&#39;t want to talk about me anymore, and I notice she&#39;s not looking as strong as usual. She actually looks like shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tía where have you been?! The suspense is killing us!&#34; She laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think you&#39;d believe me if I told you!&#34; And she laughs again. We look at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tía we would believe anything from you!&#34; Suania chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well let&#39;s leave the people to keep enjoying the reunions and since my own kids are on their way I get to have you guys to tell an actually boring tale and I am very hungry with cravings only Domingo and Berto can satisfy!&#34; And she stopped me in my tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy? Your scent mija!&#34; And she sees my mate Mark, damn here we go again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tía I don&#39;t want to talk about it, please leave it be.&#34; She was the one who explained to me how to gather Intel this way, as previous Director of OPIA, she knew every trick in the book... Hell! She wrote the prime book used today for espionage training at OPIA!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks into my eyes for what seems like forever, gives me a strong hug and drops the subject yet puts her hand to my stomach and gives me the look that she knows, but says nothing. She puts her arm over my shoulder and grabs Nia&#39;s hand and we head to The Fort. After her tenure at OPIA she served as council member to Alpha Gúarionex so she was going home too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We head to the kitchens and sit in the dinning area there, as Domingo is already putting plates for us with our hearts desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Alpha but like I said I am hungry and I linked Domingo before getting off the boat to tell him exactly what I wanted.&#34; Of course she did! And as Domingo and his apprentices filled the plates with white rice, chicken fricassee, dishes of sliced avocado and fried sweet plantains with glasses of passion fruit juice, he and Alberto sat with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey don&#39;t think for a second that we are going to miss out on this story! I have a feeling that we are in for some Jack Sparrow bullshit!&#34; I nearly choked on some rice I had just put in my mouth and Ura straight up spat out some juice! Alberto and Tía were really good friends and they were used to messing with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I could bullshit my way out of crap like Captain Jack Sparrow I would have been here before you guys, so shut it Berto!&#34; We just looked from one to another like a ping pong match. It reminded me of her and Dad...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my Goddess! I want to know what happened to my Tía can you guys quit it!&#34; Nia has never been one for banter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok so picture it! Mt. Cemí blows and I was helping in the airport with the evacuees, I link your father to check up on their stats, but he says to jump in one of the planes and go, as if I was going to receive orders from him! I try to find them and see what I can do and shift to run to them but their scent is so hard to detect because of all of the smoke, but I have an idea where they are so I keep running. Unfortunately the lava was surrounding that area and I had to turn back. I try to link him again, but I felt he was gone...&#34; Domingo brings a jar of sangria and glasses for everyone but me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way young lady, you carry our future! And he puts two drops of Tunu in my juice. Sigh. Tía takes a sip and continues...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...So by this time the last plane had left and when I reach the docks there were no more boats, and the lava is creeping my way. I calculated the swim from here to Cayo Moboyas and decide to go for it. Trust me, they didn&#39;t name that key after the god of death for nothing! It&#39;s mostly beautiful mangroves, and I can see why some go there for day trips on boats, but swimming to it in the Juracán canal is another thing entirely. There&#39;s nothing to hunt, fishing was ok but it&#39;s near impossible to cook so I would eat in my wolf form, also there&#39;s no fresh water. I had shifted so I was naked with no fabric to collect rainwater, so I just used varying survival skills using the mangroves leaves to collect the rainwater. Just yesterday I felt the link and it was the boats! I thought I was going crazy but here I am! End of story. So anything new besides what they told me in the boat?&#34; And she savors her food, no wonder she looks so haggard!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Berto hugs her, &#34;Well I&#39;m glad you&#39;re such a tough bitch, otherwise we would be counting you with the dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that would have broken your heart old friend, now if you all excuse me I want a long hot bath and sleep like if I WAS dead!&#34; I walk with her. &#34;Tía, I would like to ask you something.&#34; She stops and faces me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes mija, you count with my support, I will serve in your council just like I did for Gúarionex, have Gloria send me a full report on everything and remind her to make it to MY specifications, I hate how she organizes her reports. Send Daniella over please, I want a full check up, and tell Bayoán I want a report on the articles of war being drawn up, I want to see what they want to throw at The Council, I will make sure you go into the lion&#39;s den prepared. When are you due?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;January, they are taking into account the pregnancies of Alpha Kiskeya and your namesake, Alpha Ayiti.&#34; She thinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, we have time, February sounds good.&#34; Thank you!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They wanted me to go in BEFORE I started showing! But I moved it to February.&#34; She rolls her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s because they are dumb mija, let me guess? That was Bayoán&#39;s, Gloria&#39;s and I sense Moira drawing up those plans? Those who have NEVER been pregnant! Don&#39;t worry cielo, I&#39;m here. Over my dead body will I allow such stupidity!&#34; Thank the Goddess! I am saved!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now don&#39;t worry and focus on your duty and let me handle them, this will be done right or not at all! Make sure my office is ready, I start tomorrow at sorting out this mess and giving Bayo some help, I feel great stress from his link. We&#39;ll talk more tomorrow mija, please don&#39;t strain yourself Izzy, Domingo is right, you carry our future and we need you stronger than ever. I will also tell Daniella I want weekly reports on your pregnancy and I&#39;ll have Berto prepare a special diet, those pups are going to be strong, I feel it.&#34; She kisses my forehead and noticing the new Mark but says nothing. Even my father would always go to her for advice and back her objections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go rest Tía, I will link your orders to everyone.&#34; She stops me... &#34;You know what Alpha, scratch that... I will link the orders MYSELF, I want them all to know I&#39;m back, I haven&#39;t had fun in a while and this is going to be splendid!&#34; And she goes to rest leaving me to not have to worry about a thing.</p>
