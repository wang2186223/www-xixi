                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus and I were reading Utopia and Carl von Clausewitz&#39;s, On War. Aryn was basically giving us a cheat sheet of Loiza&#39;s notes. Deacon was always happy when Aryn contacted him and so was I. But this is the first time she gives us her notes, and I really don&#39;t feel Izzy&#39;s reading anything. Did she order Aryn to help? Aryn refuses to say but I do feel like she&#39;s helping us, did she know about our attack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deacon told her anyway... show off! But she did tell him that attacks like the one we received were happening all over the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He, he! Your mate sure has a way of talking smack about the author! Here Thomas More talks about premarital sex being punished by a lifetime of enforced celibacy and adultery being punished by enslavement. She just says: &#39;Fucking prude, enslave your own balls!&#39;. She agrees with a lot of his ideas, which were radical for 1516, but she says his martyrdom could have been avoided yet respects someone who dies for what they believe. But she REALLY despises slavery and he has a weird affinity for it. Anyway, she does heavily agree with a lot of his ideas like not going to fruitless wars and deposing tyrants. And among others, More was a fan of Cicero. You were asking about him, right? I hadn&#39;t read this before how are you going with that one?&#34; These books as insane!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When do you suppose she found the time to study all of this?! From what I understand not only is she a Priestess, but has served as a diplomat and spy, Aryn says she is knowledgeable with different weapons, styles of combat, military strategy, for Goddess sake! She even knows how to operate different planes, helicopters, boats! She&#39;s only 19 years old and she&#39;s giving James Bond a run for his money! She&#39;s basically sending us to school right now and this is not even a fraction of what she knows! This is pretty embarrassing Marcus!&#34; I was doing so much stupid shit at 19!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was thinking that if this is what she knows imagine Bayoán who is a Beta! I can&#39;t imagine the training Betas in Karaya go through! Again, no wonder The Council attacked them the way they did. Everett says his sources say they are expecting a declaration of war from them any day and Chairman Armand is nervous, he raised the number of his guards.&#34; Fucking cowards! Everyone knows that attacking Karaya Island is suicide. I wonder if she&#39;s ok, have they been able to rebuild? With more joining them they must have a system...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We get a knock at the door... One of the new members from Everett&#39;s pack comes in with a bottle of the scent repellent spray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, I would like to speak with the maker of this spray. My Pops was a skilled herbologist and taught me much about his craft and there might be a way to improve upon this mix to hide the scent fully not just merely mask it a bit. With your permission I would like to try a different blend.&#34; Ok I&#39;m interested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34; She&#39;s an Epsilon patrol, of course she would want to be fully invisible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is Josephine, Alpha! Nice to finally meet you!&#34; She says cheerfully. She&#39;s very young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! You&#39;re the one who sounded the alarm for the North border, good eyes!&#34; Marcus says. She gives a big smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Pops used to say I was a wolf with eagle eyes, Beta!&#34; She says with a little blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus give Endora a call so she can examine what Josephine knows, they might come up with something better than what we have, ok?&#34; If we can make them completely invisible it will lower any risk of them being attacked by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, sure! That would be awesome!&#34; He links someone to find Endora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You talk about your father in past tense, has he passed away?&#34; Poor kid. And she lowers her gaze, shit! I hit a nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was killed in the attack before the last one, but I&#39;m ok Alpha, his teachings have served me well.&#34; I wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was he an Epsilon, too?&#34; For herbology Chis are the best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No sir, he was a Chi, my Moms was the Epsilon, but she taught us both a thing or two. Just like my Pops called me the wolf- eagle, he said she was the wolf-owl!&#34; Does she have anyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So your mother is gone, too?&#34; She gives a sad smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We used to belong to another pack out West, but they were eradicated, I was 12 but because my Moms was brave we were able to get away. My Pops wasn&#39;t the same after that so we moved to Half Moon... We lived far from everyone, we even learned sign language to communicate. He didn&#39;t want to hear anyone&#39;s voice, he kept the pack Link blocked. I barely remember his voice...&#34; She&#39;s sniffling at this point and I feel awful. &#39;Kay don&#39;t push her man! Look at her, she&#39;s been through a lot!&#39; Marcus links. I guess we do strange things when we loose our mates. There are days I don&#39;t want to get up and just think of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Josephine, I didn&#39;t mean to pry, just curious of someone so gifted. Do you want some tea or something?&#34; For all that I&#39;m learning I seem to just fuck it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Alpha, but it&#39;s ok. If Miss Endora... that&#39;s her name right? If she&#39;s busy I can show her what I have found when she can. I don&#39;t want to interrupt her work.&#34; She was so bright eyed and has a very youthful with very fair skin and platinum blonde almost white hair in a pixie cut with very dark grey eyes and a cute button nose. She was tall and looked like she was very athletic. The mate less wolves must be trying hard to get into her pants, yet she has this air that she can handle herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josephine, Endora says to go to the place she works, out in the woods, do you know where it is?&#34; She looks a little lost at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Beta, but I don&#39;t really know. Do you have something with her scent? I&#39;ll be able to find her like that myself if it&#39;s ok?&#34; She seems quite independent, she is definitely an asset to the pack!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah here, this is one of her books, let me know if you catch the scent.&#34; Let&#39;s see if eagle eyes has a wolf nose. She scents the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, very nice! Lily of the valley and bergamot, that&#39;s a very unique scent! I&#39;ll be able to find her with this! Thanks, I&#39;ll go find her!&#34; Damn! Definitely knows her herbs. She leaves the office with a little skip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn she got that scent fast! We couldn&#39;t pin point Endora&#39;s exact sent for a few minutes!&#34; I chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, she&#39;s going to be a heartbreaker, she looks like she doesn&#39;t mess around! Now let me finish this, Izzy&#39;s notes are more cryptic here, she must have read this when she was older.&#34; Marcus says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josephine&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, it never fails! The big bright puppy eyes, the higher pitch voice, the soft smile... The hardest to learn was to blush on cue! However Alpha Kayden seems to be taking the Cacique&#39;s teachings to heart. The last message The Head sent said that the Cacique left some books for him to study, good thing too! How they had their defences before was pathetic. My mission is to keep an eye on them and the Alpha wants more information on this witch... Endora is of Greek origin for light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hope she is a light witch. So far she didn&#39;t seem like a dark caster. I made sure to take All Truth potion just in case she has her Truth spell, one sip will last a week! Morgana&#39;s talents have no end. I found her in a very deep part of the woods, she must have access to powerful magic here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I start walking with more sound I don&#39;t want her freaking out, she turns and sees me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello child, you must be Josephine. Beta Marcus said you have something for me?&#34; And the act goes back on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Miss Endora, I hope I&#39;m not interrupting.&#34; Keep your voice&#39;s pitch Joey!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all dear, just trying to pin point where some of these rogues are located. Anyway what do you have? The Beta says your father taught you herbology and that you have some ideas?&#34; She seems very nice, then again, so do I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I found these on my patrol and found different things that helped me make three mixtures: this one is of pine, acorn, apple and earth, then I made this other one of cedar and sage and this one has tightly fused particles of charcoal and baking soda. What do you think?&#34; She takes all three bottles and studies them. This is just standard field operation mixes if you run out of the good stuff they make at home, but I am NOT giving that recipe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you indeed know how to mask your scent young one, I had thought about the charcoal but haven&#39;t applied it yet. You are a bright one!&#34; I give her a brimming smile which I have practiced a hundred times before. Sweet, adorable Joey is on duty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, well I hope that helps Miss Endora, it sure would be awesome to be fully invisible out there, I hope those rogues don&#39;t come back tho, that was a scary night.&#34; I should have topped it with a &#39;Gee willekers!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will make sure to make you all as invisible as you can dear.&#34; Not with those materials you won&#39;t, but it&#39;s something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s sure lucky that you are here Miss Endora, I myself still miss life with my pops and even more our other pack out West. I am so tired of moving around, it&#39;s nice to always find a place to call home!&#34; And I notice she gives a sad smile, c&#39;mon Endora, give me something!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s nice to find a home, even if it&#39;s not with your own, I miss my old home too.&#34; Here we go!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry Miss Endora I made you sad! I will go now. I&#39;m sorry if I made you remember something unpleasant.&#34; I turn to leave... 5, 4, 3, 2---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright girl, I guess we all have our sad story, I was cast out of my coven over a misunderstanding, that&#39;s all.&#34; So she did have a coven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Usually you can fix a misunderstanding Miss Endora. As long as your sisters are ok, there is always a way, right? Although it seems you&#39;re naturally lucky!&#34; She looks curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Naturally lucky?&#34; He he!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes! From what I heard the pack has been doing well with you here, that makes you like a good luck charm!&#34; Keep at it Endora!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you child, sadly some misunderstandings stick. My family considers me very unlucky, especially since that misunderstanding was a simple mistake.&#34; Ugh! I go sit on her table like if I was a cat. Increase empathic aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Endora you said it yourself! They&#39;re your family! I would give anything to have mine back. I can&#39;t visit mine at all, you probably can easily go to-- oh I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know where your family is, are they too far that you can&#39;t even visit and set things right? I&#39;ve never been on a plane, but I betcha they would want to patch things up!&#34; C&#39;mon location...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Planes?! Ha, ha! I guess getting to Greece wouldn&#39;t be a problem on a plane. But don&#39;t worry about it, if the Goddess so wishes it I pray she will give me wisdom to reach their hearts. I wait for a sign, but she has lead me here! It&#39;s strange that she lead me to a warewolf pack!&#34; Greece! Now the investigation for every coven in Greece will begin!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I guess you are being guided by the Goddess, the Alpha seems very devout. Maybe you are here to gide HIM! His methods have been effective so far. Anyway it was nice talking with you Miss Endora, let me know if any of the mixtures I made help and I can always try to find any herbs you might need I can definitely find them!&#34; Job done for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Josephine you&#39;re a very sweet girl.&#34; Yup, so I&#39;ve been told many times!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call me Joey! It&#39;s what my Pops used to call me when he wanted to talk, ok?&#34; And close with good rapport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure Joey, I will let you know how this works out and if I do need any special herbs, thank you darling girl.&#34; No thank YOU! Code name The Baby Face has a report to send!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Miss Endora, I have patrol duties soon, see you around! Bye!&#34; Not everything, but it&#39;s a start I hope they can find more at HQ.</p>
