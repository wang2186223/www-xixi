                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard Moira was pissed at my decision to bring Alhilal Almuqadas with so much haste, I really don&#39;t give a damn for her moods anymore. But after what could be called a tantrum, and for Moira that can just be a scowl, she sent two Priestesses and with Ayana was enough to bring them over in less than an hour the next day of my order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sumayah knew the exact location and she had to assure them that they would be safe. Their Alpha and Beta, were dead and Sumayah&#39;s brother Yahir who is a Gamma, was the only leader they had. Good thing is he trusts his sister and their conditions were dire. The pack was made of mostly women and pups and just a few Warriors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phoebe verified that none were Council spies or assassins, and it was all clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayoán, Braka and Yaya insisted that I receive them in the throne room! Don&#39;t get me wrong, the Court is a beautiful structure and the Dujo is just a simple wooden bench not really a majestic throne, but it&#39;s sturdy and a symbol of the Cacique&#39;s of old with a wolf head looking out of each side. It&#39;s older than The Fort! It was the only piece of furniture from before we were Osupa and was the throne of the great Cacique Warrior Agueybaná. So I complied with the pomp and circumstance of it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They also insisted on them swearing fealty and accepting that I was their Alpha and taking the Oath to be Osupa, the same conditions that the other packs had to comply to for coming here. But I had a condition as well. To make a gesture of good faith I wanted Sumayah to be the Guardian of the Eastern Cardinal Temple so they would feel at ease that one of their own held a position of power, also I REALLY wanted a Prime Priestesses in Karaya and I trusted Sumayah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After talking with his sister, Yahir accepted the terms and were ported in right by The Fort as to bring them immediately to the throne room so that I could receive them. Master Ximena had an elegant emerald green one shoulder dress made in hours with beautiful draping. She added a gold arm band for my right arm and bangle bracelets for the left, large gold tear earrings and placed the Guanín around my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called on Master Isaura to style my hair hair in what we call the Queens Braid, it&#39;s nearly impossible to do but Master Isaura has dedicated her life to learning the arts of hair and beauty and a braid that would take several apprentices hours to make, she had it ready in 45 minutes. Isla loved the look so much she insisted to Bayoán to bring them both and give them apartments in The Fort as exclusive Masters to tend to my look. I admit, I looked damn good, but these wolves have been in caves for more than a year! Yet Isla reminded me that as Alpha I was the representation of our people and if I was to be their Alpha too, it was important that they feel secure in my power especially since I am a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Dujo is uncomfortable as hell but I sat patiently and as dignified as the bench allowed. And finally they were brought in and by the Goddess they looked like they have been in the darkest parts of Hades! I made sure to keep my face serene, but it&#39;s not a pretty sight, especially the pups... Some looked like they haven&#39;t eaten in days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sumayah climbed up to the first platform up the stairs to the throne with her brother... Damn he is a cutie! He looks as tall as Ura and Maco, copper skin, black hair, and the same turquoise eyes as his sister... &#39;You have a MATE stupid!&#39; Aryn had to chime in! &#39;I KNOW I have a mate, it&#39;s kinda hard to forget when I hear three pounding heartbeats 24/7! It doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t appreciate something nice when I see it! Now go back to giving me the silent treatment.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha I present to you my brother Yahir Ahmad.&#34; He took a knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, we have heard rumors of your power and favor with the Holy Goddess, we are grateful and honoured for your invitation for sanctuary and for the trust you have placed upon my sister to be Guardian of a sacred Temple. As Gamma and representative of Alhilal Almuqadas I accept your terms. You shall be our Alpha and we are ready to take your Oath to be Osupa, Blessed Be.&#34; And the rest of them choir in...&#34;Blessed Be!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand &#34;Blessed Be indeed! Your people shall be Osupa by the Grace of the Goddess and her infinite compassion, your great bloodline shall live on. Karaya is now your home and not mere sanctuary, you will be instructed in our ways and shown the secrets of our people and how we have achieved our power. Your people are of course free to continue your traditions and we hope to learn from you as well and with time we may take that which makes both our people strong and adapt to reach greatness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A large bronze chalice is brought forward already with wine and a dagger. I cut open my left wrist so that my blood flows freely into it until it stops and the cut heals. I pass it to Yaya and she passes it to Sumayah and one by one they all drink and say the words and instantly I feel them added to the link of our Pack like with the Blue Moon refugees and the Blood Moon escapees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that this is done with, we have a feast waiting for you all to celebrate the new Osupa members and for you receive immediate medical care. Also our Master architects and engineers have built new buildings in our Capital so that you can reside until you all are stronger and decide if you wish to stay in the Capital or move to anywhere on the island that you feel comfortable, you are all free to decide your destiny, that is a core right every Osupa has, but there&#39;s also responsibilities that come with that and there are laws to follow. It is my wish you thrive with us together as new brothers and sisters. Blessed Be!&#34; And they repeat... &#34;Blessed Be!&#34; I go down the steps linking Yahir to stand to forearm shake to officially unite our people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gives me a warm smile and I reciprocate and I can&#39;t stop smiling, he has such a peaceful aura about him and I REALLY hope he&#39;s not a reader like his sister!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome to Karaya Island, your new home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are happy to be home my Alpha&#34; And it takes me a minute to notice we are still holding on to each other&#39;s forearm and slowly let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Sumayah lead them to were everything is waiting for their welcome.&#34; And she curtsies to me... &#34;As you command My Alpha! Taeal aljamie!&#34; And she leads them to the open grounds by the entrance of The Fort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart is pounding and I go and sit down on one of the benches for supplicants. This is the first time I do this so formally and in such an important place for our people and they were just a small group. Those of Blue Moon and Blood Moon were sworn in by Moira. I will have to this when the French and Sardinians arrive and their numbers are in the thousands! Braka comes to me, putting one of his massive hands on my shoulder... &#34;You did excellent Cacique, you have done our people proud!&#34; I give him a weak smile and he leaves, he is to see who are Warriors of the new Osupa members to determine when they can be tested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My emotions are still adapting to the Block and I still have to go out to meet them one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon Izzy! You must greet them now.&#34; Yaya instructs but Isla tells her that we will join them soon. She takes me to the kitchens to get some water and puts four drops of Tunu to calm my nerves. &#34;You did wonderful mija! Take your time to settle your nerves, you have a lot going on in your body right now, but it shall pass and you will become more sure of yourself little by little, don&#39;t be so hard on yourself mi amor, ok?&#34; She takes my trembling hands in hers. I can&#39;t even look into her eyes, I feel like if I do I&#39;ll cry, stupid hormones! I hate not being able to control myself! But the Tunu is taking effect and am calm enough to look at her. And she gives me a warm smile that always fill my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ready&#34; And she takes my hand like when I was little and we go were the people are... MY PEOPLE. They seem to be enjoying the open space and the food. Tents were put in place for check ups and mental therapy, an OBGYN was put in place to verify the pregnant females, crates with new clothes were put in place so everyone can pick and choose what they desired, the pups were choosing toys and already some have started playing fútbol with local children and I enjoyed the laughter... Children being children and my hand goes to my own belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gúarionex would never have allowed this.&#34; Isla says sounding somber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think it&#39;s a mistake?&#34; She shakes her head. &#34;Iza look with your own eyes! Does it look like a mistake? Guario wanted to keep us in isolation yet we were still attacked. You are reforming not just our pack, but creating a new way of life for all who seek a different path that the one they have been given, you are making us stronger!&#34; I take her words in, they help me with any doubts I may have, I will follow the intuition gifted by the Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s right you know!&#34; And both Isla and I jump at the sudden appearance of Orwell. &#34;By the Goddess Orwell! Don&#39;t do that! I almost spit out my heart!&#34; And he gives a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s physically impossible my Queen... But The Luna is correct, in all my years roaming I have never seen what you are building here, I have already heard word from others of my kind who are willing to take your Oath and hail you as Queen.&#34; My forehead Mark gives me a soothing feeling. And I touch it, it gives me a stronger calm than my Avalon one yet this one I don&#39;t know how to control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we talking Clans or individuals?&#34; He smirks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Clans are to proud and arrogant to submit to a Wolf, but those who roam learn that wisdom lies with all creatures, even humans. Some are weary from traveling for so long and word is spreading in the Supernatural world of your rule, some will come with both good and evil intentions... As your new Council member I have already spoken with Phoebe and we will make sure to weed out any who&#39;s intentions are to destroy this paradise, it&#39;s our home as well and I pledged my Oath to you, I am Osupa, I will protect you and Karaya with my life if need be.&#34; I think on his words still looking at the children play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Contact those who wish to come, I will meet them but have Phoebe check them first, understood?&#34; And he bows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you command my Queen.&#34; And he disappears just as swiftly as he appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well &#39;my Queen&#39; it seems your admirers increase by the day mija!&#34; Wait what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I keep enjoying the children play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Don&#39;t play dumb with me Loiza! Yaya who&#39;s a Truth Seer couldn&#39;t see, but I did... That handsome Gamma was struck by you and your smile was... Special. You fancy him.&#39; She says through the link, I have only opened it up to her. I keep my eyes on the children making sure my stupid face doesn&#39;t betray me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was nervous and excited, my block is still adapting and my hormones are turning my mind to upside down, your just putting a tele novela where there&#39;s none.&#34; She laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I feel someone looking at me... I look around and find Yahir&#39;s eyes and he bows his head with a smile, and my heart starts to accelerate. I have my mate Mark on display, surely he wouldn&#39;t be tempted by a Marked woman. Get a grip Loiza! I smile at him and return my gaze to the children, I can&#39;t wait for this day to end and be alone in my room.</p>
