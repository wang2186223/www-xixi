                <p>&#34;Yeah I totally got that babe...&#34; I blow her a kiss through the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I SAID! Did she ask?&#34; I love her Brooklyn accent! Here I find her in Scotland and absolutely expect the accent of a young Lass and suddenly Harley Quinn is giving me attitude! She&#39;s adorable!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is just about to...&#34; I answer tying my boots. &#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you? Not even 24 hours!&#34; I smile triumphantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re an absolute jackass for not just offering you know! The moment the Goddess manifested herself you should have thrown yourself at her knees.&#34; What a traitor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woman, those pregnancy hormones have you talking absolute nonsense recently! Specifically just right NOW. I swear I sometimes think I should have just left you in that Pub in Edinburg and saved myself all this trouble you witch!&#34; On MY knees? Dream on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I AM a witch you mule!&#34; And suddenly I feel a strong gust of wind that pushes me on my ass! I HATE it when she does that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morgana I have been very patient, but if I do become Beta of this pack I just might bring back witch trials and burnings! Sounds delicious!&#34; And then banging at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open the door to find The General and Morgana moves the wind to knock my head to hit the door.&#34; I am going to get her for that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;STOP!&#34; I whine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then stop your bitching and get your ass down there! And never mention witch burnings again!&#34; It was only a few centuries in Europe and a few years in New England, no biggie, and they didn&#39;t even burn real witches just a bunch of humans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate you!&#34; I shout as I leave the room with Braka.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I hate you more!&#34; She shouts from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pregnancy hormones, you can understand right?&#34; I tell Braka. Simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Captain I have learned to not try to understand you, also I hope to not have to call you Captain by tonight, your sister requests your presence.&#34; She&#39;s loosing patience, I should make her grovel!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We shall see tonight General!&#34; And he grabs my shoulder with a tad too much pressure for my liking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More things have developed Captain, she won&#39;t be able to take this alone much longer. She has honored her duty to the pack, it&#39;s time you do the same. I hope you understand right?&#34; Ugh, yikes? I guess that&#39;s a no to making her grovel, damn!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More things? Wonderful! Come General let&#39;s go see my sister you can give me an account of these things that have developed.&#34; He tells me everything since we last saw each other before the hunt last night, and I cut with the funny bullshit. I knew that broken altar was a bad omen, it&#39;s not that I&#39;m superstitious or anything it&#39;s just that it&#39;s creepy as fuck! I don&#39;t want to imagine how Maco must be feeling and the thought of Morgana like that makes my blood boil, and Izzy, she hasn&#39;t even slept... ok now I do feel like a Jackass, Morgana is going to have a fiel day with me. After the hunt I just took a shower, fucked my mate a little and slept great. Ura is not going to have to turn me into a raisin! As if he could! I get to where the medic tent and Loiza is talking to Sandro and Maco, damn it must be pretty bad if Loiza brought in Sandro, not only is he an Omega, the most gifted at therapy, but he is an empath and profesor of psychotherapy at the Medical Department in the University.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to Maco and hug him and he&#39;s crying on my shoulder, how bad can she look? I look at Izzy, and boy does she look tired. I extend my hand to her... &#34;Get in here Cacique, I&#39;ll be your damn Beta!&#34; And she runs to my chest and here come the tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shush! People are going to think I am a terrible brother you two are embarrassing me and I have an image to uphold in this pack you know! Now come on Maco let&#39;s go see your mate, congratulations man! You beat Ura! You wait he&#39;s going to sulk for a month!&#34; And they laugh and I tickle Izzy and she laughs harder but then she slaps my hand away and composes herself and she is a Cacique again...&#34;Look at you two, when&#39;s the last time you showered?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We get to where Maco&#39;s mate is...WHOA, I even feel dizzy and I see that two girls are untangling her hair and two other girls giving her a sponge bath the water is filthy! And the smell... &#34;Girls go change that water, Ana how&#39;s her condition?&#34; She looks at Loiza and that is very acceptable behavior, however, as her Beta I have to assess the situation for her to be able to process any decision making right now, and take over if she can&#39;t continue. And from what I have assessed she needs at least two to three good hours of sleep at the minimum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ana it&#39;s ok I just took on to be Loiza&#39;s Beta.&#34; I look at my sister so she can name me. &#34;Loiza, sweetie just name me already, I got you. Look at you Izzy! You look like shit!&#34; C&#39;mon already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel like shit...&#34; She anwers. Damn, I should have been here last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy just do the transfer already!&#34; I am now going to be her Beta and that means that I will be able to override anyting she might decide if I find it to be against the best interests of The Pack and her own well-being, a Beta is also supposed to make sure the Alpha doesn&#39;t act like a fool. Izzy and I are not going to share the same felial Bond like before, but one more formal and oficial. That&#39;s just one of the few reasons why I did not want to be her Beta. I still and always will be her big brother, but now I will have to know my place in the hierarchy of The Pact with regards to her. I would have never imagined my little sister to be my direct superior and have to be her most skilled advisor, that will change the nature of our relationship, I guess I was just afraid to lose my baby sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Loiza Mirabal, Cacique of The Osupa Pack of the Hallowed Grounds of Karaya Island, name you Bayoán Mirabal, Captain of the 3rd Regiment, Beta of our tribe.&#34; And suddenly I felt it... my eyesight got even sharper, my nose became more sensitive, I wonder if I can beat Ura and Suania racing now, my mind starts processing faster, a Mark with the Greek B for Beta burns at my right wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SON OF A BITCH! Cut it off!&#34; What the hell did I just sign up for?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh give me a break! Quit your complaining, it&#39;s not even half the size of my mark! And I was 14 when I got mine! Now get on with it!&#34; She IS THE WORST!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Ana, about her condition?&#34; Ana now has registered my place in the hierarchy and knows to obey my command and to answer any of my questions without the need to check in with the Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The potion the alpha and Yaya have produced has helped her and the others heal much faster than without it of course, however I cannot assess her mentally because she&#39;s unconscious. I can&#39;t even feel her wolf, I imagine that&#39;s why her scars are not healing as fast, to be honest Beta, I shudder to think the conditions in which she received lesions to cause such scars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maco puts his face in his hands, I give him a squeeze and nod at Ana to get on with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She slso had a broken femur, thank the Goddess she was unconscious for me to break it again so that I can put it in place correctly so that it heals correctly, otherwise the amount of anesthesia that we would have to use to spare her that pain would not help with her healing at all. Now comes the difficult part. She would of course heal completely and look brand-spanking-new if she completes the mating ritual with Maco, however, even though they are mates we do not know her mental state and how open she will be to that at this very moment. It all depends on her right now and wait to see when she heals enough until she can wake up on her own.&#34; I look at Maco to see if he got that, the good thing about him being an engineer is that even if his mate is broken there is nothing he can&#39;t put back together! Izzy looks at me suddently, did she hear my assessment just now?</p>
