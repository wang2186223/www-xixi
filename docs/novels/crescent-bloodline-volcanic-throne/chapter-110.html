                <p>Víctor POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you talk with her?&#34; Bayoán asks, while I&#39;m checking the file on a Beta from Brazil who could be the third, I don&#39;t know why Federico kept João when his sister Janaína runs numbers better, is stronger and is a fucking Truth Seer. This might cause some tension with João, but Izz asked us to get a third if we thought we need it and we do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup.&#34; It was nice talking with Izz without sarcasm and venom... For a while she was everything I wanted. I would always be on the lookout for missions she was going on and ask to join, those were the times she was mine and when I found Magdalena the guilt was feasting on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dude seriously, what did she say?&#34; He&#39;s probably not going to like this... I don&#39;t like it. She came last night with her terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has her terms and there is no way she wants to remove the Block. She wants to give the pups what they need, and she will allow him to come back for a few more nights. She is aware of why he roared at her and she&#39;s taking the blame, but she&#39;s still not well from it. So she wants the Block to keep her numb... It&#39;s going to be, well... weird without her emotions in it and she&#39;s only going to allow it for a week, so tell him to feast on the bloodiest things he can, she only wants marrow.&#34; I can already tell he&#39;s not happy, even his mate said that it shouldn&#39;t stay up for more than two years. &#34;Look it&#39;s not what we wanted for them, but it&#39;s something. We&#39;ll keep to the original plan and see if Blood Moon accepts coming over when everything is set.&#34; He looks out the window and sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She shouldn&#39;t be going though this, the next months will be... Complicated.&#34; I can feel his concern for her, it can be felt all through the Link. The people are happy their Alpha gave them two heirs, yet everyone knows her ordeal. Magdalena was talking with the other Priestesses and they say the people are going to the Temples and Shrines with offerings for her and her mate. But it&#39;ll be complicated... Blood Moon is better prepared than most packs, so they aren&#39;t a priority right now, but already other packs that have been receiving attacks aren&#39;t, we already sent teams with proper negotiators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No shit, look I&#39;m sending you the information on the Beta I was telling you. Like I said, she&#39;s the sister to the Beta of Única Lua, she&#39;s way more accurate, a Truth Seer and from what training has shown so far, she&#39;s stronger and better at combat... We can train her in more tactical, but I have a feeling that she&#39;ll do fine. I&#39;m trying to figure out why wasn&#39;t she made Beta.&#34; Bayoán looked at the tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I imagine for the same reason my mother was not made Alpha... She was stronger than Gúarionex, but he was first born and male. Izzy said that she trusted our judgement, we&#39;ll contact Janaína, see how she feels about it and after that we&#39;ll settle it with Izzy, so prepare for shit from Federico just in case.&#34; That was a controversy a long time ago... Some in the pack though Kiskeya should have ruled, yet she declared for her brother and the matter was closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to take Izz&#39;s terms to her mate?&#34; I hope he accepts, we need those pups as strong as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;IZZ&#39;s terms? It&#39;s been quite a while since you called her that...&#34; I look him square in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayo, your not an idiot, you and half this island knows that Izz and I had something and I&#39;m not going to go into details. It&#39;s between her and me ONLY and we&#39;re dealing with trying to be friends. I kept quiet when I was angry and you can bet your ass your fishing expedition ends NOW. I have a mate I love and wouldn&#39;t do anything to hurt her and Izz has her complications but she too loves her mate and I want her happiness. Goddess knows she&#39;s EARNED it and deserves it, so don&#39;t even start, COMPRENDES PENDEJO?&#34; There&#39;s no way I&#39;m starting a gossip chain. He just smirks, typical. And raises his hands in surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, ok, no need to bite my head off!&#34; I glare at him and go back to checking another prospect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayoán we both know how things work here, I&#39;m not going to make ANY move to affect her negatively so take your cheeky questions and shove it! Now, again are you going to take Izz&#39;s terms to her mate?&#34; He signals like he&#39;s zipping his mouth... better. He and Ayato were always in her business, good thing we have video documentation of her handing their asses to them, they were humiliated but she earned their respect that day... Shit, she earned everyone&#39;s respect that day!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;ll talk with him tonight, he got the tattoo now. I have no doubt he&#39;ll accept, but it&#39;s going to be painful for him having to do this in the condition that she is.&#34; I don&#39;t want to imagine making love to my mate and just see emptiness in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayden POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was long night and a long day, Adam and Marcus are really looking into the different techniques The Osupa use for combat, every Gamma was trying it out... It&#39;s going to take a while until we get this down. I didn&#39;t expect the Goddess herself would come immediately, yet at Dusk I summoned again and intend to do so until she answers. I took a shower and laid in bed watching any events of the day in Karaya and there was the news on the racing last night and there were shots of Delphine and Hatuey fresh out of the dungeons laughing. I couldn&#39;t help but chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Usually the patrols ask the racers to take different routes to time how much it takes them to capture them trying to best their own time. Street racing is not encouraged, it was all about The Drag... however no one ever cared and the new French members seem to have a knack for it that and can definitely help us in the field for accurate and fast getaways especially if we have pups who can&#39;t shift yet or those who can&#39;t shift at all.&#34; Bayoán said as he walked through the portal. I stand up to greet him and extend my hand and he looks at it and looks at me and shakes it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayoán, Paco says you&#39;re an asshole.&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, he&#39;s been doing that since Nina started calling me that when she was 7. You&#39;re lucky you don&#39;t have sisters.&#34; He says pinching the bridge of his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t say anything bad about Nina, she&#39;s been ok with me, even smoked some of her weed!&#34; I heard some stories last night about the sour relationship between Bayoán and Nina. I learned quite a bit about The Osupa last night... It doesn&#39;t really matter where in the Greek Alphabet code your family stands, if they stand out in their area of expertise they earn mayor respect and status among the tribe. They were telling me about the Trudeau family who were from what is now Haití, they are Omegas and venerated by the pack as the best healers. Of that family is were Daniella the main physician of the island and doctor to the Alpha belongs. And Nina might be a Hellraiser who created one scandal after another, yet she was respected not just because of her family, but because of her own accomplishments as a Master Architect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean you got the weed from her... Nina can design the perfect building but for a garden Izzy is the one you need. Which is why I am here. Do you still want to help the pups?&#34; Would they let me return?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, how are they? How is she?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The pups are fine, Izzy&#39;s Block is recalibrating the roars that you threw her way, so she&#39;s basically emotionally numb.&#34; I sit and nod thinking about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She accepts blame for it, but it still doesn&#39;t change how the spell works. She still wants to give the pups what they need, so she will allow you to come back for one more week for marrow. It&#39;s going to be well... Awkward.&#34; I think on how it&#39;s going to be. Yet I still get to feel her in my arms, smell her, claim her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I understand, I still will be there for her, is there anything that can spring any emotion from her?&#34; I lock my door and go with him. We go through the portal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can try, remember it&#39;s her emotions that are basically shut off to you, her body will respond just don&#39;t expect much, if you see fear in her eyes don&#39;t panic and give her space and talk with her.&#34; And we are again at her door, If she&#39;s willing to do this for our pups I will be there for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden, we are working on getting the Block off, but in a way she&#39;s right. If we take it off now she could go off the deep end.&#34; I nod, I can smell her, I want her badly. I open her door and she is sitting still in one of her couches looking at nothing, her eyes empty. I cross the room slowly and sit next to her, I try to take her hand but she pulls it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know you had a daeva inside you. I was afraid for the pups--&#34; I sit closer to her and try to take her hand again and she allows it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s done love... Izz I swear I will never roar at you again, I thought I had really hurt you... And this is a clear indication I did. Do you forgive me?&#34; She looked at me with her dead eyes and nodded. She stands up in front of me and takes her robe off, she&#39;s naked in front of me as to get it over with. I look at her eyes... They&#39;re empty and now I understand that she really isn&#39;t there, she isn&#39;t Izz, she the mother of my pups making sure to get what they need, she doesn&#39;t have to do this, she could get a nurse maid. I caress her soft hips and her body reacts, her eyes close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby, if this is uncomfortable for you--&#34; And she steps forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden, if you can&#39;t do this I understand. But I want to breastfeed the pups, I want to ensure they are as strong as possible and the best way to achieve that is with my milk and you as an Alpha claiming me as much as possible this next week. We don&#39;t know what is trying to find me, but if it does I want to give them a fighting chance. Make no mistake Kayden, my body wants this, it&#39;s just that... I&#39;m not going to really be here.&#34; I can definitely smell how aroused she is and I was hard for her before she took off her robe. She walks to me and kneels unzipping my jeans and took out an already hard cock. She took me in her mouth little by little, until she had me completely down her throat and I was in heaven. After giving me the best blow job of my life she walks to the bed and crawls on it and stops leaving her legs open and her fingers playing with herself growing her arousal. Deacon and I can&#39;t take the scent, If I can&#39;t have her emotions I&#39;ll make sure to fuck her until she does feel SOMETHING!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to her while I take off my own clothes and push her fingers away from her pussy and touch it myself and it&#39;s dripping, I push her to the side and get behind her. I pull her body to me and lift her leg over my leg as I enter her and start pounding her without mercy, she&#39;s tight and soaking. I lick my fingers and keep stimulating her clit and my other arm was holding onto her beautiful breasts with those strawberry nipples I love so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no words with love, no looks with yearning, just fucking. Still, she moaned and screamed, her orgasms were ruining the bed and still I fucked her as hard as I could until very softly and with a sigh she said my name taking me over the edge and making me fill her as I again went for the mark on the back of her ear as I took her nipples and pinched on them. As she was trying to catch her breath I started moving inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No my lovely mate, you can&#39;t receive my love, I&#39;ll make sure that you are so well fucked that even with your stupid Block you WILL remember that I fucked you until you feel that you can&#39;t walk anymore, do you understand me beautiful?&#34; I whisper with a hoarse voice in her ear. She nodded with her eyes closed and put her arm back around my neck giving me better access to her breasts which I started suckling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I claimed her about six times just that night, we didn&#39;t really talk except for me occasionally asking her if she liked what I was doing and she asking for me to take her again. And everytime I knew she was FEELING for me when she sighed my name, I KNOW that she FELT for me. This was how it was all week, I didn&#39;t have her emotions fully, but I KNOW that she felt MY need and love for her and I did feel hers for me. Neither of us held back, and I saw a more primal side of her, one of pure lust and desire, she had no inhibitions whatsoever, there wasn&#39;t a place on her body I didn&#39;t touch, lick, eat, fuck... And now I love her even more... to me that week will always mean that she is mine no matter what, I don&#39;t know how exactly this Block works, but I DID feel loved by her. Her Block may cut my emotions from her, but hers are as bright as sunlight to me.</p>
