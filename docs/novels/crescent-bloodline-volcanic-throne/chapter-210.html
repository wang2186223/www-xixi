                <p>Robert&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you all ok? How&#39;s it like?&#34; Marla and Julie are safe in Karaya Island and William has infiltrated Gau Sakratua Odol Clan with some Unseelie Changeling glamour magic, I don&#39;t have much information on Chieftain Olaberría but vampires aren&#39;t immune to fae magic. Billy boy basically took out one of them and is impersonating him. When I informed Everett...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we have eyes on him. Edrigu García, Chieftain Olaberría won&#39;t be happy about that and the Lady Ziggy has been informed, she&#39;s livid but will keep quiet to not alert The Council and is waiting for The Osupa&#39;s answer to best proceed. So don&#39;t worry about it, we&#39;ve got it covered!&#34; Ok...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re all fine you have to see this place Bobby! We got in late last night and the kids were grumpy, all of our biological clocks were out of sync, so we were escorted to our apartments in The Fort, like no shit Bobby it&#39;s a FORTRESS! And Babe these apartments are so chic you&#39;d think we were on a boss vacation! I had my own apartment with Rachel, and Julie had her own with the boys right next to us. We all got a medical checkup first and after getting what can only be described as the best meal ever, we were given a potion to be able to fall asleep. You can imagine Julie and I trying to get the kids to take a bath and putting them to bed but after their bath and their meal, Estefanía, that&#39;s the doctor who checked us, administered the potion to the them to make sure that Julie and I didn&#39;t go overboard! They were out in minutes and I slept like a log after taking that potion myself. But Bobby when morning came and we went out to the balcony... It&#39;s like waking up in another world!&#34; She sounds very happy and I can hear the kids giggling in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen Alpha Loiza yet Love? How&#39;s Juliette&#39;s mood?&#34; She still goes into those silent spells that scare the shit out of Dominic and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We did. Baby I don&#39;t know what The Council hopes to achieve by any type of revenge, I can tell you right now it&#39;s not happening. Anyone who sees this place will just see that The Council is embarrassing themselves. Alpha Loiza received us with honors in the Throne Room and babe, when I say Throne Room I MEAN not some little bullshit Hall like Alpha Jackson has in his pack house that makes him think he&#39;s the shit! I&#39;m talking about a HUGE dome architectural feat! An actual COURT where there are benches for people to sit and in the center a wide stone staircase with shallow half Moon pools at their sides and two platforms for the supplicant at turn, we stood in the one closest to her. It was intimidating to say the least! I mean it was packed! But I&#39;ll tell you this baby, I need cash! These people have STYLE! Remember when I told you I loved Alpha Loiza&#39;s outfit when she blew up that idiot Armand?&#34; Ha! She&#39;s something else! By the Goddess I love this woman but her sense of &#39;style&#39; is going to make us broke!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes dear I remember, how&#39;s Julie?&#34; Marla has always been a pampered Daddy&#39;s girl and is easily distracted by shiny new toys, but I understand... Rachel is my only little girl too and they both gang up on me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s actually quite good! After meeting with Alpha Loiza, and yes that white dress she wore, not the actual one but the dress is up for sale and it&#39;s very popular! So after our audience with her we were interviewed by The Fort&#39;s top doctor Daniella and she could see right away Julie&#39;s depression. I explained what happened and after examining us she contacted a specialist in mate grieving counseling! Can you believe that shit Bobby?! They have not two or three pack doctors, they fucking have SPECIALISTS for EVERYTHING! And it&#39;s because that&#39;s the purpose of Omegas and Chis and Phis! They&#39;re not servants here, they are the HEALERS of the pack and are VERY respected. I just learning how they classify their members and we&#39;re doing it ALL WRONG! They asked her if she was ok with me taking care of the boys so that they could admit her to the hospital and start intensive therapy! At first she was a little hesitant but Healer Tatiana started reasoning with her and she gave in. They gave me another apartment with more bedrooms, so tell Dominic not to worry, the boys are with me. The hospital has a huge separate building that looks more like those rehab retreats that humans have for those who are addicted to something and it&#39;s REALLY peaceful! But here&#39;s the best part... We met up with Everett and Abigail and babe, they&#39;re looking VERY GOOD! Abby is recovering so well from loosing Jonas and Jeremy that she&#39;s going in HEAT this coming Full Moon!&#34; WHAT?! It&#39;s true that she still should be fertile, but Dad told us that Abby stopped getting her Heat almost a decade ago before he passed, nobody understood why and now something reactivated it?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?! HOW?!&#34; And Omegas are the DOCTORS?! Where the fuck is this information?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So check this out... She says that she was sceptical about The Osupa treatment until she DID start feeling better. Both her and Everett would just talk to their therapist together about the boys. She says that the first week was horrible because they wanted her to remember how much she loved her sons and they don&#39;t administer any medication in this period unless they see that the stress is to much and for sleep, but basically what they do during that time is allowing her mind to process and ACCEPT the tragedy that happened, but the point isn&#39;t to forget their sons, but that when they do remember them it&#39;s joy they feel instead of pain, like allowing a festering wound to drain you know? They both said that the pain was almost unbearable but that they were under strict supervision the whole time, but after a while they started feeling better and started receiving water therapy, nature runs, guided meditation in one of their FOUR Temples with a Priestess or Handmaid... Healer Tatiana explained that Julie will be going through something similar, but because Sawyer was her True Mate the process can be a little longer and more delicate. That&#39;s why they don&#39;t recommend that the boys be around, they don&#39;t want the boys to see their mother go through such a painful process that could traumatize them more and they don&#39;t want her to focus on anything other than her own health having to worry about her pups. And yes, the boys are going to receive therapy too, but after their examination they determined that the boys need more recreational therapy and that they will chat with a psychologist three days a week. But they were very concerned about Juliette&#39;s mood and they mentioned something about her pupil dilation at some answers she gave. Apparently she was in worse shape than we thought and the pups were better. Tatiana said that it&#39;s actually very common since the mother tries to shield her pups from trauma at the cost of their own health, but that in the end they wither and it&#39;s worse on the pups in the long run. They want to mentally stabilize HER before they determine that she can continue her therapy outside the hospital and that she won&#39;t hurt herself and not freak out the boys. Didn&#39;t the Lady Charlotte mention that changing her diet wasn&#39;t going to help at all? I think it makes sense Bobby, especially after seeing Abby and Everett. And not only is she getting her Heat, baby she looks STRONG! And Everett looks like he looked when Dominic and Bethany had Elizabeth!&#34; Fuck! Dr. Lenard said that Julie just needed to change her damn DIET! He never really even TALKED with her, he mainly talked with Dom... Abby&#39;s getting her Heat! I have NEVER heard of a female getting her Heat after not having it for that long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to report this to my brother! Bethie is  10 and every Heat after that hasn&#39;t been successful, Dominic is training her to be his successor despite the bullshit of the Elders. We&#39;re still determining who&#39;s still loyal to The Council but if it wasn&#39;t for our doubts he would have told them off when Alpha Loiza proved that a female can definitely lead like a BOSS! He even has gone as far to say that even if he had a son, he would have to prove that he could do a better job than Bethie. For a 10 year old, Elizabeth is her father&#39;s daughter through and through and is by his side at almost all times learning everything necessary to be Alpha of Moon Shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe how long do they estimate that Julie will be hospitalized and how did they achieve for Abby to get her Heat?! I&#39;ve never heard of such a thing. And will they send the kids to school?&#34; This could also help Marla and me, Rachel is six and besides that other Heat that was successful even though Marla had a miscarriage, we haven&#39;t had any more luck and unfortunately Rachel isn&#39;t a Beta. Henry, Juliette&#39;s oldest is, however I started training him but the boy is only 12.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tatiana says she doesn&#39;t like estimating time of therapy, something about how healing the mind is extremely complicated, but she hopes that Julie will be able to come back to The Fort in about a month. I can go see her but from a distance and no interaction for now, they want to get her out from the abyss first. They do allow letters and they gave her a dairy so she can write down anything she feels and that&#39;s absolutely private. Abby says that sometimes she re-reads her&#39;s and has a good cry but she feels better after. What happened to Abigail isn&#39;t a big miraculous thing here Bobby! Many females that came from other packs are getting their Heats too! I told Daniella about us and the miscarriage and about Bethany. I have an appointment next week with a sud-specialist because Daniella couldn&#39;t find any anomaly, but her practice is more on all around medicine. She does EVERYTHING and is the Head Master Healer of the pack but if she can&#39;t find anything she recommends a Healer that focuses on just that particular area, so next week I&#39;m going to see a Dr. Ruby McIntosh, apparently she used to be a doctor at Blood Moon Pack and left with her family when The Osupa found out about Keaton and Lydia&#39;s backstabbing shit! She started training the minute she got here on that specific field because her sister had fertility issues, notice how I said HAD Babe! I&#39;m trying to stay chill about it but I can&#39;t help getting a little excited! About Bethany they said they would have to examine her, they also want to examine you and I imagine Dominic as well... Something about a specific secretion males produce to encourage the female&#39;s body, it&#39;s really interesting! Why the fuck doesn&#39;t The Council have this information Bobby? And don&#39;t worry about the kids, they start school next week too, Master Johanna, she&#39;s basically like the Headmistress in charge of education at The Fort, will examine them and determine what will be their curriculum, who will train them in combat and what additional classes they need to ensure that they reach their maximum potential! They&#39;re at the Lagoon right now watching as the little ones get their swimming lessons and Babe you should have seen their faces when they saw the Mermaids! SHIT! My own jaw hit the sand!&#34; MERMAIDS!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean MERMAIDS Marla?! The kids aren&#39;t in the water are they?!&#34; What the actual fucked up shit is this, The Council has no information about this AT ALL!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax Bobby! I&#39;m watching them from the balcony. Babe the Mermaids are full fledged CITIZENS of Karaya and are now considered a part of the pack! Even the vampires trust them! It&#39;s actually really cute how much they are helping with the pups swimming, they even have their own little ones encouraging the pups to play! I&#39;ll ask permission to tape it to send it to you, I can imagine the heart attack your going to have when you see your little girl chasing a Mermaid, ha ha! I almost spit my own heart out but they&#39;re harmless. Well, not to outsiders, but they&#39;re everywhere here, I even heard that they swim up the rivers and go inland.&#34; Well I&#39;ll be damned! What kind of Alpha is this?! We already knew about the vampires and fae, but Mermaids? I&#39;ll make sure it stays that way, whatever Xiao, Kelsey and Asher want to do, it&#39;s best they don&#39;t know about this extra muscle The Osupa have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have a lot to report to Dominic! I KNOW my mate acts like she&#39;s unbothered by the whole baby thing, but I KNOW it DOES bother her. I definitely want more pups with my mate but the Goddess has Blessed me more than I deserve and Rachel is my little princess, I would be totally fine if only having her is the Goddess&#39;s will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I&#39;m relaxing Babe... It&#39;s just you have given me a ton to think about. Let me know what the doctor says next week and I&#39;m trusting you to keep me posted on everything else, and yeah check about the video, I&#39;m still figuring out this ring. So you need money Babe? They have places to shop sweetheart?&#34; Usually we have to leave the pack to go to the mall, we only have a few shops and dinners in the village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bobby you would have to see this place to believe it! They have three CITIES, like with fucking skyscrapers, granted not Space Needle high, but high enough to make an impact and the architecture here... Uff! It&#39;s really something, Bobby this doesn&#39;t scream PACK to me you know, it&#39;s more like... A country, that&#39;s the best description I have. Cities, shops, restaurants, cafés, highways, bars, they even have a Red Light District in the capital, they have a fucking CAPITAL for Goddess sake! The rumors we have heard are a crass underwhelming representation of reality, so keep that façade in The Bunker with those bunch of assholes! I feel bad for Asher, I really do, and Daphne was a nice lady, but Armand fucked everyone over, and the hospital where Julie is at Babe... It&#39;s not empty. Like they&#39;re thousands of wolves suffering from the lost of loved ones or PTSD from constant battles and that&#39;s without mentioning all the work their doctors are dedicating on reconstructive surgery on the survivors of not only the volcano blast, but of all the attacks that were happening to the other packs! Other packs are coming Baby, but now that everything is calm they can proceed with less hassle... I swear, I don&#39;t understand why Chairman Cain insisted on keeping those attacks after someone fucking entered their building and literally BLEW people to shit! And seriously Bobby you have to tell Dominic to get the Omegas off serving drinks and cleaning, Beta Janaína said that she would redact how they structure the pack using the Greek Alphabet so that Dominic and you can study it. And fuck yeah I need money, well to be honest I don&#39;t NEED it, all our needs are being met, but they have REALLY nice stores and I would love to go shopping! Everett and Abby are taking us to their favorite beach tomorrow with a picnic, they&#39;re living in a nice condo Downtown, but they&#39;re building a house by the lake in Caney? I think it&#39;s Caney City in the Mountains and now have the project on hold to see what&#39;s the outcome of their Heat. If it&#39;s successful they&#39;re going to change the parts of the layout they can at this stage of construction to make it more pup friendly, they&#39;re taking us on the weekend to check it out! They bought the condo either way since Everett is working for OPIA HQ now and is training with a particular family, I&#39;ll get more info tomorrow.&#34; I&#39;m trying to get my mind around all of this! And what the fuck is an OPIA?! Greek Alphabet coding? THREE cities?! As far as we knew they only have ONE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok sweetheart, I&#39;ll contact Everett to see how I can send you money, either way if you can use your credit cards, don&#39;t ok? I don&#39;t want anyone tracing you, remember that your playing dead Babe. Dominic liked that The Osupa were being very cautious so him and your Dad came up with some accident were Julie and the boys died. So as of now no contact with anyone, this is how we keep them alive, ok?&#34; My Goddess! Julie must have been near the edge!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wouldn&#39;t be the first time a True Mate committed suicide after their mate&#39;s death, hmm... Lenard is a Mu. Now I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on that code. I can always count on Marla to make good decisions, except with money but we have more than we need and she&#39;s her father&#39;s only heir so I can forgive her that, but she&#39;s always been super sharp, even when I didn&#39;t think so in highschool, she was just a typical blond cheerleader and would bully the shit out of me! I never could get laid because of her! And then the Goddess mated her to me and I find out that it WAS her little plan all along that I didn&#39;t get laid! My little minx had received a vision years before, that I was her mate, she was a contender to go to Avalon but failed and Charlotte got to go instead. She&#39;s always been very devout, but after that vision she started hiding it, she started to amp her charm level at school and became THAT girl by the time we reached highschool! By then everyone was eating out of her hand and made my social life non-existent! I still can&#39;t spin my head around that fucked up shit and I&#39;m a damn BETA! Marla is a Kappa and sings like what I imagine Selene herself must sound and used her super powers to state her claim over ME! It was diabolical and I still find it hot as fuck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Bobby, I can&#39;t keep talking, contact Everett and I&#39;ll try to contact you again soon Babe. And don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not contacting anyone, tell Daddy I love him and miss him, send my love to everyone and tell Dominic I have my eyes on Julie and the kids. Oh! I almost forgot, Julie forgot her phone on her dresser and that&#39;s where she has a ton of pics of when Sawyer was alive and of your parents. She was so angry about it and Tatiana says that part of the process is not erasing the passed loved one, but to allow the pain to flush out and be able to remember the memory with joy, isn&#39;t that exactly how it should be? Besides, they also need them for the boys&#39; own therapy. I&#39;m going down to the Shrines here to give thanks to the Goddess for our safety and for yours my Love, Bobby you have to promise me you&#39;re not going to do anything stupid! I fucking need you freako! Remember that you still have my heart in your hand idiot, I love you!&#34; Ha! Oh man, I used to be the fucking Beta&#39;s son and heir and the girl I liked started calling me Freako! It took me a minute there to put everyone in place when I became Beta! The whole family thinks it&#39;s funny as shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too my Beautiful Bully! Give my Little Princess a kiss from her Daddy!&#34; She has my own heart in her hand, it&#39;s been months since I&#39;ve held them... Protect my family Selene, I am your servant.</p>
