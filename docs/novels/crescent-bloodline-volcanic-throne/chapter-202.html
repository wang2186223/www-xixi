                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a few know what my plan is so most look confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take over the world? As in the planet Cacique?&#34; Stefan from Rumania asks confused looking over that particular report. He and everyone from Rumania are doing well and him and Beta Ioana, his cousin, handed a small company that&#39;s in pretty good shape, they also handed the legal deeds to their territory and village making it now OUR territory. It&#39;s overrun by another pack now, but I intend we reclaim every bit that was taken and ensure a full automated security system that Santino and a few of his buddies are designing at Wolf Skull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We have satellite images from every territory and the only ones that are not occupied are Oceani Luna in Sardinia, Mahina Katoa in Tonga, Blood Moon and the territory of Blue Moon which is being excavated and the dead being laid to rest in peace and the land is being blessed by Priestesses to decontaminate it of all the curses bestowed upon it by Marius. The survivors don&#39;t want to return, but are relieved to have the bones of family members that were just thrown in that ghastly pit they were in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s correct Stefan, that&#39;s the reason I invited you and the Alphas and Betas who have contributed wealth to Karaya or have experience in running a pack. Your contributions have given me a devine inspiration from the Great Mother herself!&#34; They look at each other but already Marcus, Tony and Ishaan are passing around the documents with the findings and conclusions of Professor Ibarra and his team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our pack has never engaged in taking over anyone&#39;s territory, our ancestors were basically refugees themselves and because of their determination to survive is why we&#39;re all here today. However our survival is being threatened again... Not by The Council of either Warewolves or Vampires. The fae and the elves are not a threat to us either. Everyone here, whether you were born Osupa or are so now as new citizens, KNOWS that none of those entities are REALLY a threat to us. What The Warewolf High Council did to us was a tragedy but we all know how much worse it could&#39;ve been had we not been as prepared as we were, and with the extra security measures put in place afterwards has all of us sleeping soundly at night. They, along with everyone in the Supernatural World still don&#39;t know that we have a satellite in orbit and we do have plans to build on that technology but it&#39;s Top Secret information for now. The point is that even those who are new, understand how SMALL of a problem these organizations are to us!&#34; Everyone starts discussing this and agreeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We agree with that Cacique, I don&#39;t know about you guys but as brutal as that Alpha training is, no offense Councilwolf Orocobix, I and everyone who came here feel stronger and better rested. To be honest I was desperate and couldn&#39;t bear to keep loosing my people, but coming here was the best decision I&#39;ve made and am sure that most, if not all who submitted to your rule agree. However I don&#39;t see how it will help on taking over the world.&#34; Stefan and Ioana were studying the numbers given.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it&#39;s not like we are going to go from country to country and invade! We are going to use a back door if you will.&#34; They all look up from the papers and Víctor is chuckling. Him, Ura and I had talked about this strategy years ago, I just never knew I would be in a position to actually implement it! Once the other packs started handing in corporations my forehead Mark would keep insisting on implementing the thesis Víctor, Urayoán and I had envisioned so I contacted Carla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me explain. As we agreed the Supernatural World isn&#39;t a threat to Karaya Island, in any case the threat is US and that&#39;s how I want to keep it. I WANT the rest of the Supernatural World to get to a place were they won&#39;t even DARE look our way with any ill intentions, yet our greatest threat comes from the humans. This planet that our Great Mother has gifted us is slowly dying and the humans are too focused on the bottom line and lining their pockets as much as possible to actually give a fuck! Just now Admiral Casimar has even mentioned about the increase in oil rigs off the Gulf of México! They KNOW they are killing this planet! Director if you please...&#34; Gloria hands binders of HUMAN studies from different countries and corporations which concluded that the current way they live is destroying this planet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In front of you are studies not from OUR people, but from human scientists proving that they are KNOWINGLY destroying ALL of us and they don&#39;t care. Gaia is becoming weaker by the decade because of it and more than ever she&#39;s afraid for every pollinating species on earth, they are her most precious creatures and with good reason. If every single human, warewolf, vampire, elf, etc. were to END right this instant, this planet would not only survive it, but would thrive! However if every BEE would die, ALL life on this planet would cease to exist. I&#39;m not just talking about every man, woman and child here people... I&#39;m talking EVERYTHING! It would be the end of LIFE! Every species of plant, animal, even the soil itself will be gone! Everyone you know would die in an estimate of 4 to 6 years depending on the species. And funny enough the humans ALSO have this information but their greed is larger than their will to LIVE! Because of this Gaia has determined that humans have forfeited their rights over HER domain so it&#39;s up to us to gain control.&#34; I allow them to take a few minutes to verify the handed information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The humans have known of the consequences of their actions for DECADES and instead of correcting their rape of this planet, they have opted to squeeze the life out of it and eventually themselves with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This report from this oil company is from the fucking 70&#39;s! They&#39;ve known for over half a century?! Are they completely mad?!&#34; Yengiga as well as the others look furious... And that&#39;s exactly what I wanted! Their anger will help fuel their determination for this plan to succeed. Betas are BOSSES at calculating variables in economics, however the Alphas have the right demeanor to face and stand up to competitors, politicians and unruly Board members who may challenge them. Those who have experience running a pack let alone a company will be better suited to head this project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You would be amazed at that trash island they have in the Pacific Ocean Yengiga! And there are ports were the smell of rubbish is so intense that we literally have have to use Kosiooruns to be able to breathe and I&#39;m not talking about low tide! Trust me, having enhanced smell in these places is torture!&#34; Casimar&#39;s face at the recollection was priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are days in New Delhi that the sky looks so grimy that you don&#39;t even want to breathe... And the streets! Ugh! Nobody cares about the litter all over, we would keep our territory clean but human habits have a way of infecting our habits as well.&#34; Ishaan&#39;s observation of his own past home country makes him pinch the bridge of his nose shaking his head. &#34;I&#39;m just satisfied that our pups won&#39;t have to grow up in that environment, this is the cleanest air my people have breathed, if we are to stop the demise of Earth we definitely can&#39;t keep waiting for the humans to fucking grow up! We have a plan to not only stop them, but destroy the industries that are causing these disasters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hai, I&#39;m seeing these numbers and they look good but if we&#39;re not going to conquer the humans, what backdoor is it we&#39;re going to use?&#34; Hayami asks while pointing out a study to Hiroto for a new nuclear power plant for the Hokkaido region in Japan and his face gets dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are going to use the same tactics they use! Some of the companies many of you added to the overall wealth of the pack won&#39;t just be used as business ventures to make money. Make no mistake, the numbers before you are so you can see how we CAN make very good profits from what we intend to do, and we definitely need the experience you all have to make it succeed. For those of you who don&#39;t know her I have invited Professor Carla Ayraguay, she&#39;s the most qualified person on the island to help ensure that this project starts on the right foot. She heads The Human Studies Department at the University and she in particular teaches human political science, her and her team have come up with a very solid plan to beat the humans at their own game, Professor if you may?&#34; She hands out the paperwork for the plan to everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello everyone, as the Cacique has stated we intend to use a back door. It just so happens it&#39;s the same one unscrupulous humans use to get their way. Now in all fairness not all humans are happy with the status quo and have been trying to fix the situation, the problem is that the corporations of the industries that are the main source of pollution also have vast amounts of wealth to pay off politicians who pass, or in this case DON&#39;T pass the necessary regulatory measures to control the destruction they cause. They have skilled lobbyists who redact many laws themselves to give them an edge in standing firm to their profit margin. So the plan is that WE will do the same! Profesor Ibarra has outlined different tactics to make vast amounts of money so that we could use it to pay off politicians ourselves, but we also have the means to blackmail them into early retirement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We already have operatives inside the governments of the biggest global players, and we intend for them to run for public office in these countries. So while we structure most of the companies to provide renewable energy sources with lobbyists redacting legislation that opposes the industries that are killing our planet, we will infiltrate every major political party in these countries with our own candidates and utilize glamour and other spells and potions we already use and some new ones to steer the narrative in OUR favor. We also already have a team of some of our best hackers to create an escape exhaust if you will, so that the wealth of these companies &#39;drips out&#39; and is reduced to a point where it will make it impossible for they to pay both politicians and their lobbyists, and mess with their systems rendering them blind to what their actual numbers are. While the world is in this chaos, we have already erased big chunks of information they use to determine where there are oil reserves and humans who knows that information will have their memories purged of it. The remaining piece of the plan will be to manipulate the market in our favor and crashing theirs rendering it unsustainable.&#34; Carla smirks my way making me smile. Her team has been working on different tactics and in my opinion it still needs tweaking, but knowing myself I&#39;ll probably make it more violent than it needs to be, this will do for now.</p>
