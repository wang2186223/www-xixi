                <p>Urayoán&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The destruction had us as silent as the grave... maybe not the best analogy to use, but it was accurate. The places that where not plastered with dry black lava were covered in soot and ash. Thankfully Mt. Cemí is just one of many mountains in Karaya so the damage was mostly centered around it and Itiba City, the Capital of Karaya. Unsurprisingly, the most populated part of the island... now I can see that it DOES look unnatural. Mt. Cemí isn&#39;t even the closest mountain to Itiba City, yet it&#39;s like the mountain made sure to ooze everything towards the population.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urayoán, since most of the damage is in the South Western side, go to the Uguaca Hills in the opposite side of the island and see if it&#39;s clear so that the boats and everyone else has a safe port to return to ASAP. We can clear a runway for the planes there since it will take us a few days to clear all this up, but that way everyone can return. Take Cora with you, she also can open portals, if not it will take hours. We will go to Mt. Cemí and see if we do find any sign of Blood Magic, but be alert, if The Council IS HERE, they will hide there to ambush anyone who comes to the island, so shift to sharpen your senses.&#34; Moira instructs.&#34; Damn, I wanted to shift and run, and most everyone in the pack link is saying the same. Being back even with the destruction feels liberating, Blood Moon sucks! Freya takes my hand and gives it a squeeze, and her mind tells me that we will have more than enough time to explore and run when everyone is back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you say My Lady, but... what about Loiza? Is she not to be Luna to Alpha Kayden&#39;s pack?&#34; The pack returning home is something we did know would happen, but Izzy finding a mate who is Alpha would make her Luna of Blood Moon, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look Urayoán, the Goddess didn&#39;t merely show up to Bless Loiza&#39;s naming, she did a full manifestation of power. She has &#39;crowned&#39; her. I was ordered to present her with the Royal Guanín...&#34; and her usual stone face softens. &#34;She CAN&#39;T be a Luna when the Goddess has willed her to be a Queen.&#34; And she sighs. &#34;Loiza already knows this. It will be in her hands to convince Kayden to move HIS pack HERE, that&#39;s why I ordered Bayoán to grant them time to talk... Loiza will have to use her charm to convince him. Besides, it DOES seem that their territory IS indeed cursed. Their situation is complicated to say the least, but the Goddess has mated them so I suppose that her command will prevail.&#34; Yet I can see uncertainty all over her face. I don&#39;t think I remember of any precedence for a situation like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would he reject her over this?&#34; And I am feeling pissed... Why would the Goddess do this to Izzy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Goddess gives free will Gamma, we will have to see how this plays out.&#34; And I am feeling stressed for my sister. I found my mate and couldn&#39;t imagine if I would have been rejected, but Kayden seems to REALLY want Izzy. There&#39;s more than enough land here for their pack, but Alphas are very proud... Would he give up his title for his mate? Braka who just found his mate gives me a look full of pain. &#39;Urayoán, we must trust the Alpha&#39;s skill and Alpha Kayden&#39;s need and love for her... this is without saying we still don&#39;t know if he is trustworthy.&#39; This is bullshit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon Cora, we have a Coast to investigate, I can&#39;t stomach this anymore.&#34; She nods and opens the portal and we are in Uguaca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s intact!&#34; Freya exclaims. The others start undressing and shifting, and the minute I shift I get the scent...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moira&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment we arrive I sence it but can&#39;t confirm it... not until we reach the top of the mountain will we know for sure. So I send Urayoán and his team to the opposite side of the island, if The Council IS here, that&#39;s were they will be waiting to verify the Osupa went first to seek shelter. Loiza&#39;s command to evacuate might have saved the pack. When I sensed that a Priestess lost her Mark I was more preoccupied to that matter than the cataclysm, a grave miscalculation on my part. And even though I was outraged about Bayoán speaking the Goddess&#39;s name, he did what was best for his pack and everything was legal... I thought of him more than I should... I have missed him greatly... the years we had were few but in my very long life those will always be some of my fondest memories. But just like the pack comes first for The Osupa, Avalon is my charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Urayoán leaves I portal half the Priestesses to the top of the mountain while the rest are Prime Priestesses who can start fixing the damage get to work. Once at the top we have to cover our noses...the scent of Blood Magic is everywhere! Some of my Priestesses vomit at the smell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, ladies I KNOW this is sickening but focus! I want every disgusting piece of evidence collected and taken to the dock we shan&#39;t take it to Avalon but sort through it there, we need to know who betrayed the Goddess by this infamous act!&#34; Whomever it is must be hidden by The Council. And the girls go to work... The Osupa are Avalon&#39;s most loyal allies, we even use their tech and we all are linked like a pack with opal communication rings created by the Osupa. I get a comm from Yohanna about finding not just bodies, but a pentagram.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there any sign as to which Coven it belongs to Yohanna?&#34; Morgana was right, it was her great grandmother&#39;s spell. Damn it Morgaine...who ELSE did you teach that spell to?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Braka gets my attention. There are Council soldiers to the North East... BINGO! I comm every Prime Priestess to meet me at the foot of the mountain and Yohanna helps me open a large portal for all of us to go through. I meet up with the team at Uguaca and indeed, I feel them. The Osupa are all shifted, good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ladies our job is to smoke out this vermin so that the Osupa hunters and warriors can have their blood, if you see any creature other than werewolves we will serve as backup. Is that clear?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;BLESSED BE!&#34; That&#39;s what I want to hear. And our Marks turn black, shine black and start oozing smoke. They attacked with the volcano, now we will activate those magma veins from the Earth and focus on it&#39;s sulfuric toxicity to bring them out in the open, and from the ground we can see from the Hills the gases being released throughout the base of the hills and the coast, and they start running out!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Braka gives a mighty haul signaling the attach! There&#39;s about 200 hunters and warriors thirsting for revenge for their people and their kin who run out as the harmonious pack they are and start taking heads. Blessed Be indeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Braka&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already Daemon&#39;s muzzle was drenched in blood, through the link I felt and heard everyone&#39;s rage towards the Invaders. Our people had to deal with invaders once...and lost. This time there is no magic, no Council, no nobody that would take our lands. And just when we had them on the coast going for boats to take them to a ship in the distance we ran into an invisible wall, and all of us stop. On the beach, another pentagram with a witch in every corner chanting... FUCK!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;This is BULLSHIT! What&#39;s left are getting away!&#39; Freya, Urayoán&#39;s mate says angrily through the link. She is a fierce warrior indeed, I would have liked Helena to join us, but she had her own mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly the ocean behind the witches starts to rise creating a tsunami. The Priestesses are showing what TRUE power is! Before the witches knew what was happening it was over... they were crushed by the ocean and the wall was down and we continue our pursuit for the blood of The Council wolves. The ones who have escaped in boats were now on shore because of the tsunami. We reach the shore line and they were on guard waiting for the attack. But their numbers are to few... it isn&#39;t long before the clear turquoise waters of Ticah Beach are crimson with the blood of the enemy! Yet the ship in the distance starts off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think so!&#34; I hear Moira in the distance. Two Priestesses run to the shore with us and start chanting, creating a whirlpool under the ship...we can hear the screams from the shore... Blessed Be! And then something unexpected even to the Lady Moira... A pillar of fire comes downward from the heavens and destroys what is left of the ship! It&#39;s the Goddess herself who gives the final blow! And silence owns the land. Even the Priestesses are in awe...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shift into our human form, they had only sent about 50 wolves to shore. I guess they didn&#39;t expect us back so fast and in these numbers, either way the day is ours, as well as our home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This means WAR! How DARE they desecrate hollowed ground?!&#34; Susana shouts out! And everyone howls in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is for the Cacique to determine what cause of action comes now Susana! Don&#39;t forget that!&#34; I tell them ALL.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My sister will bring the Council to it&#39;s knees one way or another!&#34; Urayoán adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moira joins us on the shore: &#34;This is just ONE battle! The Osupa want revenge, but make no mistake... it&#39;s by Loiza&#39;s wit and the power of the Goddess that you are here and that Karaya is in YOUR hands again...they gave the first blow, but it WILL be Karaya with the backing of Avalon who will give the last! Remember the tale and take it to your Kappas so they may write the songs and tales of the events of these days. They will join the tales of old and you all will be able to say how vengeance is satisfied when Karaya and Avalon work as one!&#34; Her eyes are bright white and every wolf shifts and howls in victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Priestesses raise stone from the earth and create massive docks for our ships... the beauty of the stone work with surrounding verandas are so exquisite that would bring the work of Master Kahyo, our best stone mason, to shame. They add coral from the sea and white granite to create a massive memorial so everyone who enters Karaya through this dock know that the only thing invaders find here is blood.</p>
