                <p>Bayoán POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well it seems Moira was right, Loiza has been doing her homework, but to see her stand up to Moira and turn her to not just help because the Goddess commands it, but to twist her to take a more active role in our cause was executed splendidly... if Dad and Uncle Gúarionex could see her they would very proud of her. I&#39;M proud of her! It is a great honor as a Beta to serve an Alpha worthy of the title, yet she is more than just a mere Alpha now. She is a Cacique whom even the Goddess has ordered to carry the very symbol of royalty of our people. What plan does Selene have for her? We all walk back in the tent after Braka&#39;s mate and the girls leave with Ayana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yaya walks in the tent also in black robes and cloak, she will lead the ceremony tonight and her and Loiza are in mourning attire. And I notice her registering Loiza&#39;s hierarchy status compared to Moira and lowers her face to hide her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director, has OPIA been able to locate our people?&#34; Izzy goes straight to business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not all Alpha, but we have been able to find most and have sent messages using our satellite and relaying it with the comms systems in the ships.&#34; Gloria answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what is the status of the ships? Who is in charge of the fleet now?&#34; And I sense Loiza wants to account where every member of the pack is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are led by Casimar Cacique, they are regrouping in the new rendezvous off the coast of Belize.&#34; And Izzy closes her eyes for a moment and nods in approval her eyes searching her mind. Casimar was her oficial intended mate... But when she turned 18 it turned out he wasn&#39;t destined to be her mate. He took it pretty badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations General, the fleet could do no better that Admiral Brutus&#39;s own son who stood by his father and has an impecable record. I am sure your nephew will serve Karaya with honor as his father before him.&#34; The loss of Brutus was a hard blow, but Casimar is an able Alpha with sea legs better than any pirate and is knowledgeable in all seafaring techniques. Even without technology he can sail anywhere following just the stars, just like the first Osupa searching for our new home. His brother Dagüao, a Delta is also a gifted sailor and his younger brother Hatuey, a Gamma is among the spies not yet found. Thankfully Cleo, a Gamma is here with us, and a fist fight with her means knowing your face will take days to heal. Braka trained both her and Izzy together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything else to report, General, Director?&#34; I ask both. And Gloria signals to Tatiana to come forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have you to report Tatiana?&#34; Izzy asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tatiana bows to her: &#34;Cacique, I have been treating the Blood Moon&#39;s Beta&#39;s condition and am a bit disturbed at my findings. I have used the best of my skill and he is now resting peacefully, yet things he would say in the treatment were... confusing. And I notice Loiza and Yaya share a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he say Tatiana? Is it related to us?&#34; Loiza is quick to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sincerely Alpha, I&#39;m not quite sure. But I do have my suspicions. At first it was as though his mind was blank, I administered a clear water cleanse to soothe his mind until he became responsive. And he started rambling on how &#39;they&#39; cursed this pack and that the Goddess is punishing the pack for &#39;their&#39; sins and started apologizing. I proceeded with caution as to not twist his mind more until he was able to hold a conversation, however as his mind settled more and he became more aware he would change the subject. Since his mind was still very jumbled I decided to stop so that he may rest and continue tomorrow, so I made sure to put stress blockers on his temples and administered 5 hours of Hayan drops so he may rest.&#34; Izzy crosses her arms over herself as if she was cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you not push for more answers?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because he is now my patient, to push forward in that moment could have cost a nervous breakdown to which we would not have been able to gather any information at all. This way his mind will rest and I will be able to have a session with him tomorrow to go more in-depth about what we spoke of today. I am a professional Beta, I know my craft.&#34; Can&#39;t argue with her professional opinion, I am no expert at repairing someone&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You say he was apologizing to us, did he mention as to why?&#34; And I sence a bit of fear in Izzy&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, just that &#39;they&#39; had cursed the pack with &#39;their&#39; actions. I will continue treating him tomorrow, both his body and mind needed rest.&#34; And Izzy is deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can always interrogate him or have the Lady Moira look into him.&#34; I interject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You forget yourself brother! He is Beta of the pack who is hosting us, he is brother to their Alpha and brother to ME as my mate just like I love and treat your mate as my own kin! Before I decide on how to move forward I need more proof as to the nature of the source of this gilt.&#34; She has a point, Izzy has always treated Morgana as family, worrying about Maco&#39;s nameless mate and now with Freya. I guess I am being unfair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what do you suggest sister?&#34; I ask grinding my teeth, I have just about HAD IT with this pack!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will talk with Kayden tonight to see if he gives up any information of his own volution.&#34; And I give a laugh. This is a very timid action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what makes you think he will do THAT Loiza? He wants you as his Luna of this cursed place! I say we interrog--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO! And I will not hear of that again! He is my mate, I will speak with him tonight, if I am not satisfied with his answers I will move to my next plan.&#34; Always stubborn as a mule!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And pray tell us sister, what plan is that?!&#34; What is she thinking? But I see her face darken as if her next move could make or break everything and her eyes glaze a bit. And I am regretting my tone and...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>SMACK! Morgana just smacks the back of my head. &#34;HEY!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loiza pinches the bridge of her nose. &#34;I have a plan but will not mention it until I have more evidence. Now, when will the team leave for Karaya to get said evidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We leave at your command Cacique.&#34; Braka answers. And Ura looks confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, are you guys saying that what happened was not natural? It was the volcano.&#34; He just doesn&#39;t understand the things that can be done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ura do you think I&#39;m not connected to the Earth?! I make sure to be connected to it every day! I guard The Southern Cardinal Temple... in the back there is a hut where I prepare every herb, every ingredient to every single sacred potion I make, it doesn&#39;t have a floor, just the ground. I work there barefoot for hours always connected to the Earth, the same thing at Yaya&#39;s Temple in the West. We do this to make sure that we are connected and are able to notice changes or any type of variation within the planet. And in the records of every Priestess before us never once has there ever been a mention of Mt. Cemí EVER being active. Also the professors at the University are always monitoring the mountain. I&#39;ve already read the reports from Profesor Rosa, there was no activity till exactly 4:30 yesterday morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and me have been in many missions brother, when have you ever seen me stray from my mathematical equations? I know that you still want to see me as that brat who caught your damn pigeon, but I know damn well you know who I really am. This was Foul Play, don&#39;t you fucking understand? They tried to wipe us out or at least drive us away from our home!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We already have suspicion! I just need evidence. If The Council is trying to take Karaya, if they have access to our tech that&#39;s checkmate! Our technology is what gives us an edge. Plus Karaya has been Blessed by the Goddess herself. It&#39;s literally Hallowed Ground. We can&#39;t allow them to have it. We MUST take it back! These are just precautions and to let my Beta understand how &#39;TIMID&#39; I can be. Nothing is set in stone yet.&#34; And she glares at me, she heard that I thought that talking to Kayden was timid. I rake my hair regretting that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are vulnerable right now. We have not been able to assess the island. We don&#39;t know what mechanisms are active or not. We don&#39;t even know if The Council has already accessed it! We need to move now or loose the upper ground! My Lady, General, please go now, we need information.&#34; In that we are in agreement... Avalon should have moved immediately to investigate, what was Moira thinking taking her sweet time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza, maybe some spies can infiltrate The Council and get the evidence we need while we investigate Karaya?&#34; Interesting, Moira is asking, not commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT?! Not a chance! What part of us being sitting ducks did you not get?&#34; And Moira&#39;s expression is priceless. Izzy is indeed getting bolder with her. But she is right!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Osupa spies are discovered, The Council will have the excuse they need to declare war and finish us! Get the evidence we need from Karaya itself so that we have a more clear picture of how to proceed My Lady, Braka take as many Warriors you see fit.&#34; I tell Moira... it was her own slow response which has us here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And My Lady...&#34; Izzy adds. &#34;If you can repair the damage by the lava and recover the bodies of the fallen we will be most grateful. That way IF our tech is still there I will send every Zeta, Theta, Iota, Rho and Sigma to make any repairs needed, we will need the BEST tech engineers Blessed by the earth to get the island up and running.&#34; Moira nods, she knows what is at stake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza, I am truly sorry Avalon didn&#39;t move faster---&#34; Moira starts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s DONE! We must focus on NOW... please Moira, just go help get us evidence and making us WHOLE again and never forget again that Karaya&#39;s and Avalon&#39;s fates are intertwined. You know The Council wants us both down, they keep mingling with other Supernatural species for a reason. I have a suspicion that The Werewolf Council will no longer belong to werewolves exclusively very soon, it&#39;s time to put pettiness aside and work as one. Does that sound like a reasonable ascertainment Mi Lady?&#34; Moira sighs and nods, damn... this is my baby sister! Dad always told me to never underestimate her... after coming back from Avalon they would spend a lot of alone time fixing Abuelo&#39;s car... but he and I had already fixed it. He had dismantled it with Izzy and they put it back together, it was always a TEST. Of all our siblings it was only Maco, Izzy and myself who succeeded in getting it working. And now from beyond the grave father&#39;s words are as firm as ever, I won&#39;t underestimate her again... Blessed Be.</p>
