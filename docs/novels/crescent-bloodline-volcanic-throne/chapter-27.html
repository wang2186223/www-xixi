                <p>Freya POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gets two towels wrapping me in one he keeps giving me little looks his brows  knitted together deep in thought. I can already feel that he has blocked me a little through the mate Bond. Did I do something wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ura I don&#39;t like what you&#39;re doing. I was able to reach you easier, why are you blocking me out?&#34; I even feel like I want to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No My Love, look I&#39;m stopping, ok? I don&#39;t ever want to have you out! It&#39;s just my pack does things very differently with regards to the mate Bond. And every time somebody from the outside meets somebody from my pack...&#34; &#34;... they can&#39;t handle it?&#34; I answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby what day were you born? How old are you?&#34; He asks holding me sending waves of happiness like he&#39;s trying to compensate for the few minutes I felt of sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;January 29, 1998, why?&#34; I giggle. What&#39;s up with this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning or night?&#34; He keeps asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;12:35 on the mark my mother would tell me.&#34; He turns me around and grabs my face and with the biggest grin he kisses me again. He takes his hands away and throws my towel to the floor and pushes me to the bed, oh yes, I am definitely down for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Urayoán POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guess fucking those women on missions didn&#39;t affect my standing with the Goddess! She didn&#39;t just give me my Soulmate she gave me a Twin Soul! When I finally claim her she will figure it out! We were born on the same day at the same time! No wonder she already knows the Bond just as much as an actual Osupa! I push her on the bed and spread her open like a butterfly... she is so wet and the smell of strawberries and eucalyptus fills my nostrils again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lick my lips getting ready to taste her directly from the source! I take one finger to her and watch the beautiful dance her body makes just by my touch. I take the finger to my mouth it&#39;s nothing but the sweet taste of her. She whimpers at me taking my finger away, I smile at her beautiful self with the finger still in my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Freya my love I AM going to take you and Mark you tonight, but again you HAVE to control yourself! you would have made an awful spy!&#34; I put two fingers in before she can protest and her sweet moans fill the room. I rake my eyes down her body looking at her withering form and I stroke myself with the other hand to make sure that I am as hard as possible for her, and I&#39;m solid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am no spy motherfucker! Get IN ME NOW!&#34; Ain&#39;t I the lucky boy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shush, it will always be as you say my love but I have a duty to you!&#34; And just when I feel frustration enter her thoughts I start to eat her up. I feel her frustration diminish, I move my fingers faster and feel her walls contracting. The frustration is gone and she comes strong, and while she&#39;s taking the first breath of trying to gather her thoughts...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry about this baby, but I have already sworn to you that it will always be as you say!&#34; And I ram into her hard! &#34;Oh my Goddess Ura!&#34; Oh, I know!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I keep thrusting in her and feel her walls again with my cock! Damn, no wonder wars have started because of this! I know already that I would kill and die for her. She comes hard again, FUUUCK! I move her hair out of the way and extend my canines, Dyus takes over and my eyes are gold and just as I cum I bite down on the base of neck and everything goes so bright suddently. I had never come that much and so hard before!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urayoán I love you, swear you will never leave me!&#34; She cries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t swear that baby it&#39;s a futile question, you&#39;ll know why in hopefully more than a minute.&#34; And I turn us around puting her on top. &#34;Once a female claims the male there usually is about ten to twenty seconds that neither of them can block from the other. Usually people don&#39;t care for it... well they had the best fuck of their lives to that point. We are Twin Souls, we will never be able to close it unless we get the Blessing of a Priestess and the Goddess allows it. You will always know everything about me and I will always know everything of you. That is cero privacy love... I am sorry now I didn&#39;t mention it before we started...&#34; &#34;... now you realized that even the bad thoughts we have sometimes will be exposed to the other?&#34; She finishes and I look down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah basically, that was kinda selfish... we where born at the same time, same day&#34;  Damn! I should have thought this through!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you fucking suck it up already! And we are going to die the same day at the same time! This Bond is rare and I am up for the ride as long as it&#39;s with you! So you fuck me hard so that I can claim you weirdo!&#34; Fuck yeah! I am already hard for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lie my hands behind my head... &#34;Do you like what you see?&#34; After a few minutes my thoughts won&#39;t be mine alone, Freya and I won&#39;t share a mate link because there will be nothing stoping our thoughts from reaching the other... will we even need to TALK after this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess you are going to know the answer of any question you might have about me at your disposal at any time!&#34; She impales herself on me and my shaft is once again  surrounded by her electricity making me growl and push my hips towards her. She keeps pushing herself on me. I can&#39;t stop looking at her bouncing breasts. I stop pushing myself in her and sit so she can  maneuver herself, I take her breasts in my hands and rub her hard nipples with my thumbs...she gives a little whimper. Fuck she&#39;s beautiful. I take one nipple and round with my tongue, and I get another adorable whimper. I take it all in my mouth and her sweet moans are intoxicating. So what if she knows everything about me?! I rather have that, than not have her! I suckle her other nipple and keep stroking the other with my thumb I feel her wall contracting and determination to claim me. I look at her eyes now shining turquoise, and that&#39;s the last confirmation I need that she is indeed my Twin Soul, Willow&#39;s eyes are black but now they are shining turquoise, the color Avalon has assigned for Mate and I gulp she will know in a second, but the Goddess is inside Willow! She comes down and claims the spot above the clavicle bone. That&#39;s the first bone I ever broke and time stops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes and I am at Caney Beach!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;It&#39;s gorgeous! So this is where you learned how to surf?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Freya you are here!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s the point!&#39; And she starts laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I guess you&#39;re right my love, this is what we signed on for...&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;How are we going to get this back? I don&#39;t see Izzy having an Endgame yet.&#39; She says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I know&#39; And I hold her. &#39;I want to teach our pups how to surf here, AND yes you too, although I think you just have to tap in my own knowledge, I have a feeling I won&#39;t have to teach you anything I already know!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Do you think it&#39;s strange?&#39; She asks with uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I have no idea right now love.&#39; We will always be connected this way, there will be no way to be able to have secrets from her, would not able to surprise her in any way shape or form. But I feel so at peace with her in my arms in front of the beach I love so much and her being able to live it with me because she is in my mind all the time. I can already feel her apprehension for me to look into her. I won&#39;t. She knows I won&#39;t. Only when she allows me to. She can enjoy my memories in the meantime, except for yesterday morning I have so many good ones. She should enjoy herself for a while. And feel how much I love her, and feel certain that as a new member of The Osupa we will fight for her, she is rogue no more ever again.</p>
