                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving Loiza&#39;s room I go meet with my father and Marcus to where the rest of The Osupa were. We made sure to assure their comfort, Alexis made a great lunch of Cuban sandwiches and freshly squeezed orange juice, I even ate one of those suckers! Those are damn good! Most of the people of the pack had healed from any wounds that they had, however some had wounds that cannot be fixed. Some people had lost their leg or an arm, many of those cases happened because of simply tripping and stopping their fall but their hand falling in the lava. At the very least the only a small number, however they still don&#39;t know the full extent of their casualties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are so many.&#34; I tell Marcus. He has been trying to help sort out the casualties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And those are just the ones that arrive by plane, I heard someone say that some had evacuated on boats and still they outnumber us. Mom was helping distribute food when a few moments ago their General asked her instead of helping the people to just help their own Luna who is grieving. He sent some guards with them to the pack house.&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it does make sense, from what I heard the Luna lost her mate and her son both at the same time, she most definitely be distraught. Plus, she is one of moms acquaintances.&#34; That&#39;s how she would call people who were close to her,  she has has weird phobia of calling anyone a friend. &#34;Ok, so what&#39;s going on now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They seem to be a proud people, they&#39;re only accepting as little help as possible. Most of the people have been tended to and are being escorted by their own Warriors to the tents that we set up, and they don&#39;t seem to be wanting to be separated to Blue Moon, last I heard Marius is on his way to try to persuade them, that way we won&#39;t be so swamped... anyway I hear congratulations are in order, so you finally found your mate! How is she?&#34; He asks with a huge stupid grin on. But I can&#39;t help smile at the thought of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is better now, I had no idea of how draining it is to be a Priestess of the Goddess, has mom ever talked to you about any of this? She even recommended Jolene to help, but then I find out from her brothers that to be an assistant to a Priestess you need proper training, that&#39;s why they stayed behind to make sure that she was safe.&#34; I tell him with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom never talks about any of that, but what do you mean that you need proper training to be an assistant to a Priestess? And safe? No one&#39;s going to hurt her in the pack house, especially with her being your mate!&#34; He answers with raised eyebrows clearly getting confused himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I explain everything that happened his expression went really dark. &#34;So basically she could have died, no wonder they&#39;re interrogating their other Priestess. This IS strange.&#34; And Marcus goes into deep thought, I can already see the wheels turning in his head. &#34;I&#39;m also surprised that you kept your cool during that whole ordeal. And I can definitely understand her brothers concern with regards to you, I asked you the same question that he asked you, do you think you&#39;ll be able to handle being mated it to a Priestess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am shocked that he would even ask me and I feel the anger in me raise... &#34;Please brother, elaborate on your stupid question!&#34; He can see my eyes are black and I am clearly PISSED.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spare me your outrage Kayden! This is serious, your mate is a Priestess of the Goddess! Do you have any understanding of what that means? The Goddess has placed one of her most treasured warriors under YOUR protection! How many women have you bedded already, how do you know if you don&#39;t have any loose pups around? Every time you get bored with some woman you just throw her to the side, I&#39;ve been telling you for years the difference between a regular fuck and a mate and the potential harm you can cause her with your usual lifestyle.&#34; Fuck! Marcus always finds a way to cut through my bullshit. The moment he mentioned the other women I felt sick to my stomach all the sudden, it&#39;s been dozens of them and I know for certain none of them had one of my pups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The moment Deacon told me that our mate was on the way I haven&#39;t been able to stop thinking about her, and the moment I laid eyes on her I knew I would not lay eyes on any other woman again! And with regards to lost pups I&#39;ve always sent Avis to investigate the validity of any claim and it always turns out that it&#39;s a ploy! You said it yourself this IS MY MATE! I can already feel her, I already know I love her and would do ANYTHING for her.&#34; I roared at him! If he wasn&#39;t my brother I would have sliced him in half for talking to me like that! I am breathing heavily right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks at me thoughtfully for a moment...&#34;I guess now you understand the power of the Bond and from what I see from these people they don&#39;t mess around with it. Already 27 people have found their mates within the Osupa, NONE have been rejected but like Dad told us before, they are in mourning and do not want to engage just yet, except for two. Those two couples already all lovey-dovey. Goddess help you if you reject or hurt your mate in any way. You forget that I know you better than anyone Kayden!&#34; And I am surprised when the last bit was said with a growl. I look away knowing he is right and I didn&#39;t want him to see my face full of shame. Even Deacon gives me an &#39;I told you so&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;FINE! What do you want me to say Marcus? That you were right and I was wrong? Well you know what? This is that day... you were right and I was wrong! The power of the Bond is stronger than any lust I may have. I&#39;m never going to reject her! EVER! She is MINE!&#34; I am so angry at myself now, he HAS been warning me for years. I am willing to wait for her, I just hope that she accepts me soon because I really can&#39;t wait to hold her in my arms at the very least. Then I remember the love and devotion Loiza has form her brothers and how Marcus is more similar to their ways than me. Sure we have always been close but he has always acted like the older brother, even when we were little and him being younger, if I got in trouble he stood by me always. I have no right to reproach anything from him. I rub in between my eyebrows and when I look up at him he has this huge triumphant smirk on his face!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you would see things my way once this happened to you and you got a freaking Priestess! You lucky bastard! And if your next question is if I&#39;m jealous, the answer is yes. If you treat her right you are on your way to an even better sex life that you had before with only one woman. So again congratulations!&#34; And just like that my brother proves once again that he is a better man than I am. And I pulled that bugger in to hug him. &#34;I&#39;m sorry brother!&#34; He hugs me back and just tells me... &#34;Cherish her brother, if you hurt her I doubt the Goddess will give you a second chance.&#34;  He Kayden&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving Loiza&#39;s room I go meet with my father and Marcus to where the rest of the Osupa were. We made sure to assure their comfort, Alexis made a great lunch of Cuban sandwiches and freshly squeezed orange juice, I even ate one of those suckers! Those are damn good! Most of the people of the pack had healed from any wounds that they had, however some had wounds that cannot be fixed. Some people had lost their leg or an arm, many of those cases happened because of simply tripping and stopping their fall but their hand falling in the lava. At the very least the only a small number, however they still don&#39;t know the full extent of their casualties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are so many.&#34; I tell Marcus. He has been trying to help sort out the casualties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And those are just the ones that arrive by plane, I heard someone say that some had evacuated on boats and still they outnumber us. Mom was helping distribute food when a few moments ago their General asked her instead of helping the people to just help their own Luna who is grieving. He sent some guards with them to the pack house.&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it does make sense, from what I heard the Luna lost her mate and her son both at the same time, she most definitely be distraught. Plus, she is one of moms acquaintances.&#34; That&#39;s how she would call people who were close to her, she has has weird phobia of calling anyone a friend. &#34;Ok, so what&#39;s going on now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They seem to be a proud people, they&#39;re only accepting as little help as possible. Most of the people have been tended to and are being a squirted by their own Warriors to the tents that we set up, and they don&#39;t seem to be wanting to be separated to Blue Moon, last I heard Marius is on his way to try to persuade them, that way we won&#39;t be so swamped... anyway I hear congratulations are in order, so you finally found your mate! How is she?&#34; He askes with a huge stupid grin on. But I can&#39;t help smile at the thought of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is better now, I had no idea of how draining it is to be a priestess of the goddess, has mom ever talk to you about any of this? He even recommended Jolene to help, but then I find out from her brothers that to be an assistant to a priestess you need proper training, that&#39;s why they stayed behind to make sure that she was safe.&#34; I tell him with a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom never talks about any of that, but what do you mean that you need proper training to be an assistant to a Priestess? And safe? No one&#39;s going to hurt her in the pack house, especially with her being your mate!&#34; He answers with raised eyebrows clearly getting confused himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I explain everything that happened his expression went really dark. &#34;So basically she could have died, no wonder they&#39;re interrogating their other Priestesses. This is strange.&#34; And Marcus goes into deep thought, I can already see the wheels turning in his head. &#34;I&#39;m also surprised that you kept your cool during that whole ordeal. And I can definitely understand her brothers concern with regards to you, I asked you the same question that he asked you, do you think you&#39;ll be able to handle being mated it to a priestess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am shocked that he would even ask me and I feel the anger in me raise... &#34;Please brother, elaborate on your stupid question!&#34; He can see my eyes are black and I am clearly PISSED.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spare me your outrage Kayden! This is serious, your mate is a Priestess of the Goddess! Do you have any understanding of what that means? The Goddess has placed one of her most treasured warriors under YOUR protection! How many women have you bedded already, how do you know if you don&#39;t have any loose pups around? Every time you get bored with some woman you just throw her to the side, I&#39;ve been telling you for years the difference between a regular fuck and a mate and the potential harm you can cause her with your usual lifestyle.&#34; Fuck! Marcus always finds a way to cut through my bullshit. The moment he mentioned the other women I felt sick to my stomach all the sudden, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s been dozens of them and I know for certain none of them had one of my pups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The moment Deacon told me that our mate with on the way I haven&#39;t been able to stop thinking about her without even looking at her oh, and the moment I laid eyes on her I knew I would not lay eyes on any other woman again! And with regards to lost pups I&#39;ve always sent Avis to investigate the validity of any claim and it always turns out that it&#39;s a ploy! You said it yourself this IS MY MATE! I can already feel her, I already know I love her and would do ANYTHING for her.&#34; I roared at him! If he wasn&#39;t my brother I would have sliced him in half for talking to me like that! I am breathing heavily right now.</p>
