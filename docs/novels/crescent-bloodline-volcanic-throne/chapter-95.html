                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I literally growled at poor Mónica! She has been Head Nanny and Nurse Maid at The Fort for 20 years and has always been very capable at her work. I realized just as the growl left my lips and felt awful about it. I had just nursed the twins and she was going to take them to the nursery so that I could finally rest after their birth. I was healing fast but my body begged for rest!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my Goddesses! Mónica I am SO SORRY! I don&#39;t know what came over me!&#34; I was an emotional wreck! Yet I still had my pups in my arms reluctant to let them go. Yet she and Isla started laughing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha it&#39;s all right! You are not the first mother who has growled or roared at me for that matter for assisting them take their pups, especially for the first rest. It&#39;s our nature! Of course you don&#39;t want to part with them! But you have done wonderfully so far mom, they are clean, full and are sleeping soundly, but you need to heal yourself and need a good nap! I will bring them back in two hours to be nursed again with dinner for you.&#34; I looked at them sleeping in my arms but still didn&#39;t want to part with them. I have already chosen their names and my Bond to them was growing by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I can rest with them HERE, I mean they are sleeping, too!&#34; She shakes her head smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It never fails to amaze me how every new mother reacts, even a mighty Alpha!&#34; She kept trying to reason with me, but then Daniella walked in with both Bayoán and Víctor, I knew what this meant, they were going to override me! Luckily Isla and Tía, who came with them saw the desperation in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, before this goes to another level let&#39;s do this... Izzy mi cielo, how about Ayiti and I stay HERE right over there by the living room with the babies, WE will take care of them. We will raise the sound barrier between the rooms so Ayiti and I can play briscas or watch a movie, allowing you to rest but knowing that your pups are RIGHT HERE with US and we will wake you when they need to be fed again. But you NEED rest! It will only be Ayiti and me, how does that sound mija?&#34; I was thinking. I DID like that idea better, they are like my own mothers and I would still have their scent close by even if I was asleep. I nodded as a few tears left my eyes. What is WRONG with me?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isla wiped my tears. &#34;It&#39;s NORMAL what you&#39;re feeling Izzy, your hormones are starting to recalibrate! NOTHING is wrong with you, I know you enough to know that you are asking yourself that! Mónica bring the bassinets for the pups here.&#34; She kept a steady, soothing pitch to her voice and Mónica went to task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now Loiza mija let me hold mis nietos, right Ayiti?&#34; And Ayiti came over with her warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isla is right mija! We will be RIGHT HERE your nose will be full of their scent and I do have some chismes to tell Isla, let me smother my adorable nephew and niece.&#34; Both Isla and Ayiti extended their arms and I gave out a whimper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon mija, with all you have done, you CAN do this. Don&#39;t forget we will be right here.&#34; More stupid tears, this is humiliating! Isla wiped those too. And I hand them over to them and I take a deep breath. Daniella gives me some Hayan drops for dreamless sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Their scent will soothe you, sleep will heal you and remember we are right here, we&#39;re not going anywhere, ok?&#34; I nod at Isla&#39;s words and already feel sleep taking me and it finally wins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayoán&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Víctor and I walk back to our office. We started working from separate offices the first day he started before he moved in, but it only took about five hours of both linking and taking papers and sending e-mails back and forth constantly that our patience got the better of us. We both cursed that Izzy&#39;s idea of sharing the office in the East Wing was actually the most practical one. She still doesn&#39;t know we took her idea... I told Víctor to be ready for the gloating. We had two large desks facing each other, a nice living room space to not have to have a bite of food or coffee at our desk and the large windows there had a way better view than the ones either of our separate offices had. We still had a view of Karayita and was close enough to the gardens that even though he couldn&#39;t see her, our new scent ability allowed Víctor to be full of The Lady Magdalena&#39;s scent to really help him be very calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In less than an hour of us working there, we definitely felt more in sync and at ease. All we had to do was look into our identical eyes and every idea was exchanged, every calculation one of us couldn&#39;t quite complete the other would. What would take us over a couple of hours separately we could solve in minutes! And being together we would crack jokes and be silly and it was our secret, making us feel more comfortable with each other and helping grow our camaraderie and help deepen our own Bond. It made work easier, more effective and fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must admit, I was a little worried that we would have to override the Alpha, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever be comfortable with that part of the job.&#34; He said when we sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve already done it and she took it well, but THIS is a whole different thing entirely. Morgana&#39;s already in her last trimester and if I saw the desperation in her eyes Izzy had, of letting go of our pup and think that someone would ORDER her to, I would probably spend a few nights in the dungeon.&#34; He was deep in thought about it and I could feel he was thinking the same thing about his own mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I would have been in the dungeons too... Mine hasn&#39;t even had her Heat and this just made my stomach turn! I did everything my patience would allow and then some to convince Diego to come, and it was for HER!&#34; He had his head in his crossed arms on his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And remember, it still would not be like that for our mates. No one would have to override their wishes, they&#39;re not Alphas and they both have their mates to soothe and comfort them. Izzy doesn&#39;t have that! Sure we are giving her all the support we can, but it doesn&#39;t compare to having her mate. Rest comes easy for females when they have their mates because they know he will protect the pup with his life! What she did was something only a very few have achieved, without going insane of what she saw, the reality that her mate&#39;s family help with the deaths of over a thousand our people, our parents, our Alpha! Because of the pleasure of the fertilization of the egg and in this case too she was able to see very clearly that they indeed had knowledge of The Council wanting us weak and away from our home. But since it was such a short time she could only gather so much intel about it and that&#39;s why it took time to recalibrate and go again through the data to be able to determine what truly was the timeline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Between you and me, I actually do think Kayden was trying to confess what happened the morning he had to execute those slavers. He kept asking for Izzy saying that he had something important to tell her, he even told Moira, he even begged her. Dude, get the tattoo ASAP! I look back and can&#39;t explain a lot of things. It was me! It&#39;s just, somethings I took it way to far or didn&#39;t care about the consequences. Like when we added seven more heads for Kayden to cut off. Moira... She hates touching The Sword of Peace and will do anything to avoid it, so of course she wouldn&#39;t want to execute any one with it. She would definitely not care if Kayden, whom now I now she didn&#39;t calculate for was risked. He and Izzy were mated by Gaia, not Selene, and she has never liked things... &#39;out of place&#39;. She never calculated for interference from her.&#34; I have been thinking about that a lot lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me guess? The Alpha doesn&#39;t know.&#34; Víctor asks. I just shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was at the peak of her Heat and it was the full moon. So to be near him right before the moment the she was going be mated and Marked to get the information, was torture for her. The Lady Ayana opened a portal to be here with Nina. Nina was going to Uguaca Bay to start getting ideas for Atabex City. Her body was begging to be fertilized.&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her Heat started on the SECOND day after meeting her mate?!&#34; Víctor asked. And it&#39;s a natural question, usually it takes weeks for a female&#39;s heat to kick in after they&#39;ve met their mate. The Bond takes it&#39;s time for the mated to know and adapt to each other. Then the female&#39;s heat begins, driving both sides into reproduction overload. There is usually a work leave for that, both have to be together at all times to feed that urge or be subjected to extreme physical pain, until the female has been fertilized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For an Alpha and a Luna the need is higher because it&#39;s to make the heir, the next leader of the pack. For TWO Alphas... I bet he came a few times before he even touched her! As you can see, we knew she was pregnant almost instantly and with twins no less! Our informant in the inside says that he has refused to get a Block and right now is on sedatives, he is getting everything she&#39;s feeling and doesn&#39;t know WHY but everything in him is telling him to go to her but he can&#39;t. If Izzy&#39;s having it bad, I don&#39;t want to be in his shoes.&#34; Víctor gives me a glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So she went through all of that, probably without the need for it?! What the FUCK Bayoán?! When are you going to tell her?!&#34; Great not what I need right now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look man Moira just told me because she visited him and he reminded her! Those days were pretty chaotic and we already had things in motion and if you hadn&#39;t noticed, it has been crazy here too! Now that my brain has you to divide the work it allowed me to give it more though, add to that that I had a fucking THING inside me mucking everything in my head! So spare me Víctor, you weren&#39;t there.&#34; I&#39;m actually not pissed, I just want him to see that I wish I could have told her, but I really forgot. He becomes thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dude we HAVE to tell her! He might want to join us and be WITH her and his pups! Alpha or no, I bet my head he would prefer to be with her than be Alpha. I know I would be ANYTHING as long as it makes Magdalena happy; Beta, First Gun, all of that be dammed as long as get to be inside her!&#34; I KNOW!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on Víctor! You are Beta now, you have that power! Tell her! Dude look inside the Bond you now share with her, look beyond all her barriers and labyrinths that she has placed that take you nowhere, what do YOU see?&#34; And he closes his eyes to focusses and he sees it. It&#39;s pure pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not pretty huh? Now assess Beta. We still have prisoners to interrogate and war to declare, the Alpha&#39;s hormones are recalibrating, Izzy and Ayiti were right to delay this until after she gave birth, you should have seen her after the Block went up right after the Marking was done, she was a shell. For a moment I thought she was too far gone and the madness was taking her. It was Morgana who assured me it was the blocking spell doing it&#39;s job. Then everything going on and now this! She will be on leave until she is emotionally stable, look at the report on what happened when she snapped because of my bullshit and that was about Suania&#39;s mate, not HERS!&#34; He checks the report and acquired video surveillance of it and my exorcism. And the storm she created.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What in Hades?!&#34; Exactly...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on Víctor! At least we have more Priestesses now! How do you think your beloved Magdalena will be able to fare against THAT?!&#34; His jaw was on his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wasn&#39;t High Priestess by this date! I guess it can wait... But after the War Declaration we must tell her! What Betas would we be by with holding this information.&#34; Will she forgive me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Terrible ones. How do you think I feel? She&#39;s not only my Alpha, she&#39;s my little sister! I feel awful treating her mate like that. The guy might basically just be guilty of being afraid of loosing his mate and every single one of us has been guilty of that one time or other.&#34;</p>
