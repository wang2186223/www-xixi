                <p>What. The. Actual. Fuck?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have always been hella proud of the history of our tribe, but our FAMILY history in itself is bitchin as fuck! None of us expected this sudden uppercut! If Izzy wouldn&#39;t have read Mami&#39;s dairy we ALL know Tía and Isla would&#39;ve taken it to the grave, those two are the queens of gossip of the family right now, so if neither said anything it meant they had no intention to. We are ALL pissed! How could they?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;FINE, but I don&#39;t want to hear shit if I say things you would&#39;ve rather not know.&#34; What more can there be?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut the bullshit! Just spit it out Councilwolf! I&#39;m loosing patience FAST!&#34; Izzy is trying to collect herself and her aura, it got a little suffocating there for a minute!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to it CACIQUE! Your Mami and Isla grew up in The Fort together and I was over there all the time. Isla is after all Alberto&#39;s half sister and their father was brilliant at his craft and Alberto was a prodigy! The Acosta family has ALWAYS served at The Fort and after Alberto&#39;s mother passed during her accident at labor, Enrique, their dad got a second chance mate and only had Isla. Anyway, the point is we know each other really well, and when we were girls, I was older after all and would spend my free time hanging out mostly with her brother, we would give Kiskeya a hard time since we were all so jelly of her being trained and mentored by Orocobix, El Guapo! Give me a damn break! EVERY unmated female would salivate in his presence! If only you knew how many times Isla, I and other girls and boys would go to the training yard showers to see if we cough a glimpse of the legendary cock of such an Adonis! But Kiske never seemed interested in him, yet she WAS fond of him, and Isla and I started suspecting that her training included EXTRA activities, if you know what I mean?&#34; Ewww! Mom sex stories!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goddess! SERIOUSLY Mom?!&#34; Lola drops her head in humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my Goddess...&#34; Umbros says in a low voice of shame lowering his face and covering it with one of his hands. Totally embarrassed by his mom!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For fucks sake Tía get to it!&#34; DAMN! I&#39;ve never heard Maco talking to Tía that way, especially with his new extra chill vibe!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch how you speak to me bo--&#34; Oh boy...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;GO ON! GIVE ME THE PLEASURE OF CALLING YOUR PATRIARCH BOY OLD WOMAN! I SWEAR AYITI, I WILL STRIP YOU OF OUR NAME! JUST YOUR SILENCE IN THIS MATTER IS DISRESPECTFUL ENOUGH! HOW DARE YOU KEEP THIS FROM US?!&#34; Yikes, just edit what I said! As head of our family, Maco HAS the authority to erase your name from the family&#39;s history and fully disown and banish you from our house and family and that includes Adelola&#39;s protection as you would be viewed as an outsider. So even if you carry her blood, she won&#39;t grant you access inside, especially the family burial chamber. Our family wouldn&#39;t claim your bones and you would have to find another place for you to be buried. Just the thought of my remains not being with my family is TERRIFYING!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To honor the dead in our tribe is a VERY sacred right of passage, and now more than ever that we are being more devout to Gaia. As children of the Moon we believe in ALL of the phases of life, and just as birth brings new joy and blood to the family, death grants a person history and legacy, giving them A NEW LIFE. The pain suffered among those left behind brings a new factor of intimacy to the filial bond making it stronger. That&#39;s why I think we are what we are now. What we ALL did as a FAMILY, as a PACK, we achieved by the strength of our collective grief... Sparked by OUR own family pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s already being recorded as the MOST harmonious, united and powerful moment in our history, putting the Mirabal name in the PINNACLE of our history! And since what we are achieving now is under Izzy&#39;s rule HER LEGACY, and those who follow will ALWAYS have a place of High Honor in the burial chamber. Many members of our family have written in their diaries having Adelola shown herself to them and even have conversations with her in the burial chamber, and they ALL say that she just straight up said that she had bound her soul to this house to appear and guide those who would forward her own legacy. Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m kind of purposely mediocre, I don&#39;t think I would like that experience! The Catacombs have always scared the SHIT out of me! It&#39;s like I start going down there and I hear thousands of voices! Izzy, Yadiel and Tali had always loved going down there for some reason or other. But you try going down there! It&#39;s creepy as hell! I&#39;m not a big fan of horror stories here! And a lot of our history is crimson from all of the blood, it&#39;s not that I&#39;m afraid of no ghost... Fuck, who am I kidding? I&#39;m afraid of ghosts! I&#39;m not going to be hiding my own phobias like Bayo!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We have always respected several gods, and we have always followed certain rules they demand. And the main rule that Gaia demands is that all of her children return to her bosom. For our people the dead MUST be underground ASAP for they must return to Gaia&#39;s womb. For him to make this threat he&#39;s officially giving her a red card! None of us want our bones discarded by our family and having that phase of our lives destroyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Patriarch. I forgot my place. I hope that you can forgive me nephew.&#34; She says softly in a cool, calm and collected manner while looking at Izzy with a super cold glare of death! It&#39;s hysterical! But I really contain myself, this is a MAJOR threat but either way Izzy is looking at her with a gleaming smile! The other two female Alphas only ruled for a VERY short time and really didn&#39;t do anything major during their legacy except babies. Izzy&#39;s doing way more than that! So even if she were to die tomorrow, Goddesses Bless her! Her ripple still would be huge in the tribe!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Tía, we are blood. I also remember those days with Babushka and how she would whack me with her damn stick if I mispronounced a single word in Russian! It&#39;s amazing going down memory lane! Please CONTINUE.&#34; And we see Tia perspiring and closing her eyes. It&#39;s not like we already don&#39;t know! We just want to know what the hell happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I was saying... We thought Kiske was having her fun with the dashing Alpha. Nobody knew or suspected his relationship with Beatriz, he WAS only 17 when he impregnated the still beautiful Luna, who was already a mother and had been mated for 15 years. She like MANY lusted after the young handsome Warrior with a body of a GOD! Even the other day at the meeting I was trying to control my own body reacting to his oozing charm and sex appeal. His father decided to name him Elder before his time, I guess he wanted to try to contain his lust and virility, but for all of Elder Biautex&#39;s efforts, Orocobix seems to still have a healthy sexual appetite and has even regained his fetish for Lunas. Either way Beatriz was supper thirsty for the much younger Orocobix and he was never one to refuse pussy from a beautiful woman, especially a Luna and their strong pheromones. When he found out about Kiskeya, and her being an Alpha we was livid with Beatriz! Last I heard he had 16 children and I think 7 died, some in the blast including your mother, but Kiske was the only Alpha and he swore to Beatriz to keep her secret for the sake of her reputation but she had to do everything in her power to ensure that HE train his Alpha daughter... everyone knows that the Guerrero Alpha training is the BEST and he wanted HIS daughter to rule. The Guerrero family has been trying to achieve ruling class for centuries and Izzy gave it to them! So it&#39;s no surprise that he would want your rule to be successful mija. After I found out he was Kiske&#39;s father it felt weird to lust after him, but Isla was younger and very bold back then, a free spirited Kappa through and through! So she still desired him badly. Look, so what?! Big deal! So you all belong to the Guerrero family instead of the Reals, at least there you have more relatives and a potential strong ally to our family. If you acknowledge them publicly as their daughter they will definitely support your rule even more and might even take the title of Elder from your grandfather until he IS of an age to rightfully be one!&#34; Ok she unloaded a lot. This is giving me a headache!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our grandmother seduced him?!&#34; Nina asks trying to make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have NINE Tios and Tias?!&#34; This is insane!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh PLEASE! She wasn&#39;t the only one! Orocobix has always lived well not just because of the vast Guerrero wealth, but also so many unmated women desired him and would seduce him not just with their bodies, MANY very wealthy ones would shower him with anything he desired as long as he would continue pleasuring them. Not that he was complaining of course, he is the third son after all and he loved being off island... Goddess only knows how many women he had OUTSIDE!&#34; Ew! Seems like this grampa already has more than enough grandkids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a damn minute! What is this &#39;... fetish for Lunas...&#39; bullshit?! The only Luna after Beatriz is Isla. What are you saying Tía?&#34; Bayoán chimes in. Oh, that one slipped me. We all look at Tía.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever! Orocobix hasn&#39;t stepped foot inside The Fort since Kiskeya declined to be Alpha and was promptly mated to Ayato the moment she turned 18. Your father spent a small fortune for rituals for her to be OFFICIALLY his, since they were really into each other since very young. Your father was as distressed as us at Kiske&#39;s attachment to the dashing Alpha, but he was the first she told so he continued his pursuit of her, they would meet up at the Real family home since it was fully empty by then, their numbers had declined to almost nothing. Your Mami would always tell us about her little rumbles with my baby bro---&#34; AHHHH! MOM AND DAD SEX!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MY EARS!&#34; I shout!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it Tía what does THAT have to do with ISLA?! Stop using fucking pivots! So Mami and Dad FUCKED! GOOD! If not WE wouldn&#39;t be here setting fireworks up YOUR damn ass! Stop the bullshit at get to it!&#34; Izzy&#39;s DONE! She wants to know PERIOD. Tía doesn&#39;t look that well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;FINE! Tía... I understand that you don&#39;t want to betray Isla, so I&#39;ll take the full responsibility with Mamá, the only reason I didn&#39;t invite her to this gathering is because I only wanted the CORE Mirabals here. But she&#39;s still family AND Luna, she&#39;s MY RESPONSIBILITY! I ORDER you to tell us right now!&#34; We all slowly look back at Tía, she looks like she&#39;s about to be sick. And she sighs in defeat closing her eyes again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was kinda my fault... I kept telling the girls how much fun and great sex was that they kinda became inpatient. I was already coming and going from the island and they would listen to my stories. While your Mami had Ayato and they had their fun and later were mated, is a more wholesome love story. However Isla was almost obsessed with Orocobix and wanted him to be her first, she wanted someone with experience and would drool every time she would see him naked. The training yard stands would always be full every time he trained to see him naked as much as possible. Anyway, since Isla knew Kiske wasn&#39;t Agüebaná&#39;s daughter she played a VERY BOLD move for a Kappa from downstairs. She went to Luna Beatriz with some tea laced with Emi Esu, when Beatriz started to hallucinate and spout anything, Isla asked her what aphrodisiac she had used on Agüebaná to make him believe the baby was his. In her state, Beatriz gave her the information. Once Isla had what she came for she coaxed Beatriz to take Forgetting potion. Very impressive for an almost 15 year old KAPPA! Well her mom WAS an Epsilon and did give her training. She then went to Yaya who was surprised by her request, but Isla told Yaya she knew EVERYTHING and she swore never to say anything as long as Yaya gave her the potion. For the sake of the packs harmony Yaya gave it to her. For her Quinceañera, Enrique held a grand celebration for his daughter who&#39;s beauty was becoming quite notorious in the pack, so everyone who was anybody was invited including Orocobix. By the end of the party she went to Orocobix and sprayed him with the substance! He was twice her age but couldn&#39;t fight the strong potion. She guided him to her room and had him many times that night.&#34; Wait...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAAAAT?!&#34; We ALL shouted and even Natalia stood up so fast that the heavy chair was knocked to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tía, your accusing Isla of basically RAPING him, it looks like they were ALL USING him! That&#39;s disgusting! Now I&#39;m actually feeling bad for him! Shit he was a BOY when Beatriz got to him, and even as an adult he was DRUGGED by a girl! I&#39;m now understanding why he wouldn&#39;t give a shit about the women he&#39;s fucked and all the children he had with them! I imagine he thinks women just want him for one reason. That&#39;s so sad...&#34; Izzy sits down next to Tali who&#39;s picking up her chair and sitting down taking Izzy&#39;s hand. Isla Is their milk mother after all, but I can feel that they&#39;re conflicted. They ADORE Isla, but what she did, even if she was the young one, doesn&#39;t take from the fact that she took his consent from him, no matter his age. It&#39;s taboo!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you all keep your panties on! Whatever Isla or Orocobix did in the pass the problem has been corrected.&#34; Corrected? Huh?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean CORRECTED?&#34; Bayo ask in a chilling voice, for us taking someone&#39;s consent, not just on matters of sex, but EVERYTHING is against the law! We consider it no different than slavery. And now I&#39;m feeling bad for our grandpa too! Izzy has a point. If he has been manipulated in this way since he was so young he probably doesn&#39;t know anything else. Usually people complain that society sexualizes girls, but he was sexualized too, and from what Tía says apparently he still is! I have to see this guy! I asked for a picture of him on my opal ring... And yeah, he&#39;s kinda old but he is VERY handsome, I can barely see wrinkles and he looks like he never stops training. Nina leans over to get a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;DAMN! Our Abuelo&#39;s a hottie! It&#39;s kinda like looking at Old Man Maco! But still... HOW was something like this allowed? Izz is right! We ALL know that this is highly taboo and ILLEGAL!&#34; Nina looks over at Izzy and Tali a bit distressed for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please mija! From the information I have you ALSO chose your Quinceañera to get rid of your V-Card and no one said shit! We are WAREWOLVES, we are not humans, our physiology works very differently!&#34; It&#39;s true, in our species, just like with the fae, our libido goes haywire for BOTH males and females during puberty. In humans that sexual spike hits their females the closer they get to their menopause age. That&#39;s why human female reach their sexual peak at around their 40s, it&#39;s like their bodies are giving a last push for procreation. In warewolves, we have Heats, we don&#39;t menstruate, so our age doesn&#39;t determine our fertility. For a male to be able to impregnate a female not in Heat, the male must have given so much pleasure to the female that her body voluntarily releases an egg. With Casicaná, Abuelo Imotonex must have REALLY given good to Abuela Adelola.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck off Tía! I have NEVER DRUGGED anyone and I didn&#39;t hook up with someone twice my age!&#34; I look over at Maco who&#39;s giving Tía a cold glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tía this has nothing to do with Nina, so lay off! What did you mean by &#39;It was corrected?&#39; Umbros, I want to hear the TRUTH cousin.&#34; Umbros smirks at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We ALL will Patriarch!&#34; And he glares at his mother, I have a feeling that he&#39;s talking about HIS own father. If I would&#39;ve known this was going to be more than Maco taking on as head of the family I would have dressed more comfortable!</p>
