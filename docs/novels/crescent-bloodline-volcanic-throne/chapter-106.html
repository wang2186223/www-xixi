                <p>Bayoán&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did what?&#34; She asks. Here we go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We overrode your dumbass command, that&#39;s what we did.&#34; Izzy&#39;s Block was recalibrating and she was in a little haze like before, it was numbing her emotions, it&#39;s what the Block was meant to do and as numb as she is she must be very depressed. She was all day in her room with the pups, only Isla, Ayiti or Víctor and I were allowed access. I hate that she&#39;s depressed, but as her Beta I&#39;m not lying to my Alpha and I am definitely not lying to my sister, so did I use the fact that she was depressed and numb to give her information that could cause my kid to be an only child? You bet your ass I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you do that? That ring has information on my children.&#34; She looks so tired. But at least what Kayden did made her strong and is producing a lot of milk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re his as well! Izzy, he had a daeva inside him, he might have some anger about everything that happened, but you KNOW he would do anything for you. Do you know HOW you recovered? The moment he found out that you had his pups and how you looked and said in that recording, he had his men try to link that kid Jason when they reached this area. By doing that Jason told Víctor and me, we asked Daniella if it could work and Isla insisted. He found a way to contact us to give you anything you could need to get better. You KNOW it was the daeva making him say things that he may have in his head. You KNOW he would never sell you and the pups out or try to take you or them by force. So he roared at you! I&#39;m sure that even with the Block it must have hurt like hell and I&#39;m sure that he feels like shit for it. But you said he only did it after he saw you were going to take the ring, the ONLY way for him to see you and his kids. I&#39;m going to tell you something little sister, if I would have been in his place I would have probably done the same even without the daeva. He is a mated wolf without his mate, he is a father without his pups and here you come and try to take the only comfort he has! You ARE acting COLD to him, so yeah, the daeva WOULD put that in his head! Besides the daeva, did he mistreat you in any way?&#34; And just as I am done venting at her stone face a single tear is shed from her dead eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since that Block went up I have been asking Morgana to keep an eye on it. At first I didn&#39;t care about her rejecting to feel anything for Kayden, why would I? Moira assumed he would reject her and she would be paired with someone stronger, more suitable for her. It never happened, then we thought he got that witch to put up a buffer (No one not of the line of Morgaine Le Fay can put up a full Block, even with it, Izzy still will get some feelings from him) but Joey&#39;s report says he refused it. Opting instead for a charm to enhance her scent, but instead of torturing him, her report indicates it helped him focus more. The weird fascination Gaia seems to have for them both, even giving him her blade and Marking him and his family to be protected from it. Then there&#39;s the fact that Izzy got her heat basically A DAY after meeting her mate and granted an immediate successful one of twins, that&#39;s not normal AT ALL for a regular mating, Ura and Freya are something different. He relaxes and nourishes her and she helps him fucus and be more determined and they&#39;re both miserable without each other. I passed all this information to Víctor after what happened and he agreed we should give Kayden the ring back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you imagine if they do have a particular destiny? She has a Block that&#39;s helping her, but he doesn&#39;t, he gets everything she feels. Did you read the whole report?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which part? Joey tends to be very detailed.&#34; Tía did train her mother in this and Ayiti doesn&#39;t like incomplete reports.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The part where he has a part of himself sheltered from the pack so they don&#39;t get to feel what he feels, going every full moon to howl for her... He&#39;s detaching a part of himself from the pack, Joey got to see what he has locked away with that spell the Lady Yaya made. He&#39;s also in a very deep depression and even with the Block so is she. And before the daeva her mood was very, well she really was...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... Happy&#34; I finished. &#34;True, those two nights she was recovering, but the mood I got from her end was joy. And yeah, that part of Joey&#39;s report was curious. How do you think he&#39;s able to disconnect a singular part of himself from his pack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have never heard of it before now. I can&#39;t and don&#39;t want to imagine being in his place, I just imagine someone not letting me see Magdalena... Just the thought makes me sick. What are we fucking asking from him exactly? Think about it? Are we asking him to be like us just because he&#39;s the Alpha&#39;s mate? Let&#39;s be realistic here Bayoán, most of the people we have brought in will never be as strong as we are until the next generation who will be raised from childhood like us. How does he get to do that? Do we expect them to get training just by a ring with information? He has to be stronger, but how can he, what helps him focus is her. How can we ask him to be better if he has to deal with the pain alone, knowing that his mate and pups are denied to him?! I mean, the guy just checked how to heal his mate as quickly as possible after seeing how she was, without even checking any risk to himself? She&#39;s a fucking Alpha! Whether he&#39;s one or not, she still could have sucked the life out of him! And then even being told about the risk, he still did it again. Dude I don&#39;t know how I feel about this... It&#39;s not our way, they&#39;re both going through a lot of trauma, Izz still hasn&#39;t really got any therapy for fighting the mountain, I know her well enough to know she&#39;s kicking herself about it. They had bad luck every time they met! We can work on him being strong and better HERE, but at least they&#39;ll be together and can heal. Isn&#39;t that what keeps us strong? Every time we have a particular health need we make sure to see to it. Is there a law that excludes Alphas from this? I don&#39;t remember there being one. I really don&#39;t think he&#39;ll have a problem submitting to her and bringing his pack here if that is what his pack wants to do. He basically has denounced The Council and has gone under the jurisdiction of Avalon itself. We&#39;re the ones who declared war on The Werewolf High Council, but by getting out from their jurisdiction he has put a target on his pack. Sooner or later the packs that go against The Council publicly like his already has, are going to need sanctuary! So why are we delaying this? And if his pack doesn&#39;t want to come all he has to do is give his title of Alpha to his brother.&#34; Izzy knew I was harsh on Kayden so she definitely would want an unbiased Beta working with her. Especially someone who wasn&#39;t at Blood Moon and someone who wouldn&#39;t kiss her ass. Víctor would help balance not just what was good for what Izzy needed, but what made simple sense for all parties, but most importantly the balance of the PACK.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Víctor isn&#39;t as much an asshole like before Magdalena, but Izzy was not on his top favorite people. They had a several missions. Most were simple diplomatic missions and Izzy was going in her concept as Priestess and would be granted an escort, the last thing The Osupa need is having to report that The Lady Loiza was killed in a mission as ambassador. So Víctor was assigned as her bodyguard and I KNOW that Yadiel, Bruno, Casimar and him were waiting for her to turn 18 to see if she was mate to one of them. I also know that it was always Casimar who she had hoped for, but apparently something did happened in those trips between them. I don&#39;t know if they had intercourse, but I do think he wanted at least some promise from her, but for a Priestess who&#39;s not yet 18 that would be going against her beliefs, she wouldn&#39;t do it. Yaya never found her mate and married Cayetano, but she never made any promises to him and he accepted those terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is a promise? Two wolves who don&#39;t find their mate get together as chosen mates and promise to reject a true mate should one be found. But for all the kisses him, Casimar and Bruno might have gotten from her, her 18th birthday came and none of them was her mate. Bruno and Yadiel were ok with it but Casimar and Víctor went out to the field immediately... I know Casimar almost got to third base with her but I have no idea how far Víctor got that eventually made them really dislike each other, especially after the mission in Honduras. Ura did tell me that Víctor did get further than Casimar, he thinks he did get to third base, but Izzy was close to 18 and she wanted to reach it before she decided how to move forward and to leave her be, it&#39;s actually quite a normal practice here. I have a feeling that he didn&#39;t like ALMOST having her, but while for her it was water under the bridge, it was a big hit to his ego... Even though they all waited for her to turn 18 and none of them got her anyway. Either way I don&#39;t intend to ask and they seem to have put it passed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit next to her and wipe her tear away, while another one peaks itself out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy I am sending Francisco tonight to tattoo him, do you want to try again tomorrow?&#34; She shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayoán, why don&#39;t we wait for Master Oller do his work and allow Izzy some time to think about it. C&#39;mon mija, you are hurting even with that Block, I already told you what I think about it and even Morgana told you not to abuse it. You still need him to help you for a while longer at the very least Loiza.&#34; Isla tries to reason with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave me with my pups, I don&#39;t want to see anyone right now.&#34; This is stupid!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? So you can sulk in the dark about it?&#34; She gave me the look of death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send Morgana, if the Block can be made stronger I might consider it, in the meantime I would like to think about my options.&#34; Fuck that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sending my mate to experiment with spells that meddle with your emotions so that you end up as an emotionless robot like the other time, especially with the pups. In any case I agree with Isla, it has to go and maybe you can feel what he&#39;s going through and you can BOTH deal with your shit!&#34; She stands up and kicks everyone out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I CAN&#39;T DEAL with it right now, get out!&#34; Her eyes were golden pools of rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Typical.&#34; Víctor said. And walked away.</p>
