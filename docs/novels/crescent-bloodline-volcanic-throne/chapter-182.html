                <p>Marcus&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think she meant by that?&#34; I ask Tali. After coming home and making love to her we just lay holding each other in bed, I can&#39;t help but play with her hair to help relax her. The day was so draining to them and us as a family. Since noon I could feel her tension. Kayden, Tony and Morgana were very anxious too and we all had our own Circle with Freya giving us the play by play. Nasser came up late waiting for the batch of brownies... They kicked me good!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She intends to take over the world. Izzy usually is pretty straight forward!&#34; Tali said matter of factly and went to clean herself and like a pup I followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As in... the planet?! Tali, um, seriously? Many have tried and failed. How does she intend on achieving that?&#34; Her eyes are focused moving rapidly as I feel her run all the scenarios. She&#39;s doing calculations like a Beta! I suddenly stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talia, are you calculating projections?&#34; She looks at me confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Tío Ayato thought us! I don&#39;t know what Bayo&#39;s talking about when he says Izzy&#39;s thinking more like a Beta, she&#39;s ALWAYS though like that, we kinda all do. Everyone forgets that she was outside the pack link for seven years! I don&#39;t even want to imagine what it must be like, to never feel the hum of the pack.&#34; Just the thought brings a chill through my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus it&#39;s fine! Bayoán even let it go without a problem. You will be thought ways of combat and strategy of other ranks, sometimes you adapt to fighting styles or thinking styles not of your natural coding. With me I went more for a Beta thinking and mixing my natural Epsilon nature with the eye for fastidious detail like a Kappa. Izzy has always had a calculative thinking process like a Beta, but held her Gamma mentality as well as mixing her original rank fighting style making it stronger by applying Epsilon agility and now she has to increase on her Alpha training, which now should be easier since Kayden&#39;s with her.&#34; She puts a robe on as I finish drying myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what&#39;s your assessment beautiful?&#34; After seeing so much of their origins, the exquisite tapestry that is my mate&#39;s lineage I am determined to uncover as much from our side as possible. The good thing is we know where to start and which Clan our family belonged to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Taking into consideration everything that she&#39;s setting up... Even though she has the same goal as Imotonex, she&#39;s letting go of the reigns of the family. She&#39;s already established that we don&#39;t need power since we already have it, all we have to do is to MAINTAIN it, and to maintain it we have to work as a unit. Maco is really the main peacekeeper of our family and if we are to be a unit there must be peace among us. As stressful as the day was many things were resolved or brought to the light which could give our family an edge, and she&#39;s not just taking into account Tía Kiskeya&#39;s desire to strengthen the family from within, but she&#39;s also taking into account it&#39;s expansion like Tío was planning. And then you guys sparked an idea with the corporations...&#34; I serve a glass of wine for each of us while we sit outside enjoying the night&#39;s air full of the smell of the ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am not worrying about our borders being attacked, I&#39;m not waiting for an alarm to go off out of nowhere. I just found out they have a fucking satellite in space! They monitor the waters and sky 24/7 and have an A.I. checking for any anomalies throughout the planet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why The Council attacked the way they did otherwise they wouldn&#39;t have been able to. And if they can achieve this new project that they intend to create to fully protect the island it would give each and every one of us full piece of mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ayiti had embraced Ishaan and myself the day we got here...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;BOTH my daughters nabbed a Beta! You focus now on your Heat! If we keep expanding, Deacon or Jade will definitely need more Betas, so make sure to give it your best boys!&#34; Ayiti was very enthusiastic... Ishaan and I looked at each other awkwardly, our mates glaring at us to listen to their mother. Adam got introduced to her in today&#39;s circumstances... Ayiti was not doing so well but got better later on and started nagging him to put her son in his place and that she would find some friend she knows to train him and since she was top agent for years before becoming Director of OPIA, she gave him all the information he needed and wants to take him under her wing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She only said that she wanted to meet with all of us in a few days to give us time to gather any documentation that is needed and to go to any bank vaults.&#34; Since the attack, they have been using the worldwide event to be able to come and go through portals to receive agents, and send new batches going to intercept different areas. They have agents in the embassies of the major world players all over the globe, inside their governments. Even the Ambassador at the UN from Belgium is one of them and are already mobilizing Special Operations agents in different countries to get their campaigns ready to run for parliaments, congresses and senates. If their mobilizing in that scale, what does she plan for the corporations?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adam went ballistic when they started to explain to him! He gets the inside scoop for being family. We&#39;re all really happy that he found his mate, and a powerful one at that! They both could be actually pretty indestructible if they set their mind to it and I&#39;m pretty sure Adam will whip Umbros into shape. And I can definitely understand how he would been hesitant. If it would have been back home he more than likely WOULD have been rejected, we would see it all the time, here they put you on a boat and they send you off on your merry way if you DARE reject a mate. In a way it gives you a sense of security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day Tali wanted to just go running to let out the stress of the day before, I was curious about the coconut farm. I don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s any state that has one, but even so it&#39;s open to run through it. Here there is no such thing as a private beach and wolves with farms don&#39;t mind others running through them, they live by a strict code of honor among themselves. Stealing amongst themselves and allies is very frowned upon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The farm is located a few miles south of Atabex City so Wilk and Cordelia were able to REALLY stretch their legs. We started going towards the mountains yet once we were north of the airport he ran on the coast, our paws splashing on the shoreline. Right before reaching the farm she shifted midair and jumped in the water... There were a few people on that beach but no one even flinched! A few pups were building sand castles and they didn&#39;t look up!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What are you waiting for babe? The water feels wonderful! Get your cute ass in here, it&#39;s going to get a little warmer in the farm we should cool off a bit now!&#39; As much as The Caribbean is really never touched by winter it doesn&#39;t mean the temperature doesn&#39;t change throughout the year and as it&#39;s summer it&#39;s VERY hot, however since we are by the ocean we get it&#39;s breeze constantly so the weather is still pleasant. It was crazy muggy in Virginia... Everyone who&#39;s not Osupa (except for the French and Brazilians) are having difficulty adapting to just being naked even though it&#39;s an important part of shifting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shift and walk to the water... No one is paying any attention to me and I see Tali waiting for me chuckling in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water IS wonderful and it doesn&#39;t serve as a shield for my nakedness at ALL! The water is so clear and clean! It&#39;s like walking into a turquoise pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll get used to it Papi, it&#39;s not just about loosing modesty, it&#39;s about survival. You&#39;ll learn more about that in training.&#34; She wraps her arms around my neck and kisses me deeply. I hug her tight and give her bubble butt a squeeze making her laugh! We went deeper in the water taking advantage of the lack of waves and had a quickie right there! Even though we were pretty far away from the shoreline, no one even bothered to look our way. I was kinda nervous at first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Papi, the grown-ups KNOW what we&#39;re doing, but it&#39;s very not out of the ordinary here when the beach is as empty as it&#39;s now, and those pups are too focused on their own fun!&#34; When we got out of the water there was an orange haired mermaid with the fins like those of a clown fish making out with a teenager on the shore, his buddies were sliding on the wet sand with wood boards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to try it?!&#34; She notices my curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know how?&#34; I ask her looking into her memories. Freya and Urayoán can&#39;t keep secrets from each other but having him as her Twin Soul gives her his same knowledge instantly. She didn&#39;t have to LEARN how to do anything, if he knew it, so did she and vise versa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look for the blue string, it has all my memories on all types of sand surfing.&#34; Sand surfing... They use a small wood board throwing it into the slick sand towards water and then jumping on it midway sliding into the water. Seems easy enough!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now I understand what Izzy meant about not allowing Kayden near the Cobra until she saw how he raced. I have all the theoretical knowledge, now I have to put it practical and it&#39;s not so simple, I know exactly what I have to do now I just have to make sure I do it correctly. It took me a few tries to actually get it and in less than 20 minutes I was a pro! Never in my years of studying matings had I read of such a thing! The most fascinating part was that I was naked the whole time and I didn&#39;t even realize it until she told me to shift so that we can go on our way! Nobody said ANYTHING!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running through the farm was something I definitely want to do again! Wilk&#39;s nose was doing its own workout!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Papi let Wilk smell through the fruit&#39;s outer cortex! Get through it all and reach it&#39;s core! Scent out the coconut and let the scent of the ocean mix with it!&#39; She linked me the main joy they received inside their wolves while running here... I&#39;m salivating! She pounces on me to play on some sand patches and shifts while laughing and I shift with her but still looking to see if there&#39;s anyone around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sees it and laughs some more! &#34;Papi, you were just naked NOW! You&#39;re a WAREWOLF! When you&#39;re naked as a wolf you don&#39;t have a problem because you have been thought to see your spirit animal as just that... An animal. As INFERIOR! They are the CORE of WHO and WHAT we are as a species! Without them we are JUST human! Survival is a key reason why not wearing clothes is a non issue for us, but we never try to develop that human anthropocentric EGO, we don&#39;t see ourselves as neither inferior or superior to any creature in nature. We&#39;re nowhere near the most important creature on Earth, that throne goes to bees and it&#39;s because without them there would be no planet AT ALL! We as a people have taken into consideration the hive mind of bees to enhance the Link of the pack, that gives us power. We follow our Primal animal&#39;s instinct, why shouldn&#39;t that include not caring for what we do or don&#39;t wear?&#34; She explains calmly, just like Kayden said Izz was teaching him back at Blood Moon. There was no hint of mockery in her tone. Anthropocentric EGO huh? I had never seen it that way before. I still feel a little off and suddenly another couple of wolves runs by just nodding to us and continued running not batting an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn back to look at Tali and she&#39;s looking for fallen coconuts, they can&#39;t pick them of the tree in the farm, only those that don&#39;t belong to anyone. But if they&#39;re on the ground already there&#39;s no need on letting it spoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I scented a few around here baby, keep your eyes and nose alert!&#34; And right by my foot I see some. She extended her claw and swiftly sliced the top giving us access to the water inside. It was heaven after that run! She slashed it open to munch on the meat inside, it was such a light snack and drink on the way we had a few more and left the shells there and continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually we left the farm area and went straight to the mountains into the rainforest. Wilk&#39;s scent receptors and ears were super alert and again she shifted midair and fell into a 20 ft drop down a waterfall and falling gracefully into a clear fresh watering hole. I jumped behind her! The water was colder than the ocean which was welcome because of the heat. She goes to the waterfall and opens her mouth drinking the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s spring water babe, taste this!&#34; It was fresh and cold and clean and everything you imagine when you see these in pictures or TV. She told me to sit with her by some flat rocks below the waterfall and we allowed the water to beat out all of the stress from our necks and back... I fucked her behind the waterfall until we came a few times, our sounds echoing through the small cave chamber. After another swim she lead me to wild banana trees and we ate every single banana of one tree! They were tiny ones that tasted like apples, she told me that they&#39;re originally from The Philippines but early agents loved them so much because they tasted of apple which couldn&#39;t grow in the Caribbean, yet &#39;los manzanos&#39; (Apple banana) could. She explained that some other family had a farm were they grow them, along regular bananas and plantain. We ran from place to place in the forest, eating and drinking our fill throughout the day out of anything the island provided. We were completely FREE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By sundown we found our clothes right were we left them by the broken Sentinel fort at the wall by The Fort. We went to our apartment and showered and she had already ordered multiple types of fresh ceviche with both types of fried plantains, &#39;maduros&#39; and &#39;tostones&#39; and cold beers. We ran, swam and fucked all day, we didn&#39;t need to pack a picnic, we never worried about thirst. We burn LOADS of calories by nature but even more in wolf form, we saw only a few people and after a while I forgot I was naked until we found our clothes. I don&#39;t remember allowing myself to be so primal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Talia, I don&#39;t think I ever remember Wilk and me feeling so free! Your right! After a while I fully embraced my wolf and nothing else mattered except for the run, the food and sex. I was FULLY a WOLF and it was LIBERATING! And this place! We found food and drink EVERYWHERE... Is it like this always Tali?!&#34; I stroke her stunning face and her smile dazzles me. This food is amazing! This beer is the shit! I have to talk to Thomas to invest in a brewery! We can add our own Irish-Scot brew, I&#39;m actually excited for our future! Just to think my children will grow up HERE! This day alone opened my eyes to the REAL value of this place, no wonder Everett and Abigail are healing, besides everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I gave Avis&#39;s mom their founds so they could open their account, Eveline looked different. Three of her children found their mates besides Avis including his brother Albert. Her and her sister were looking very happy and jovial with a more healthy color! Those two old broads didn&#39;t care about the nudity so much, they enjoyed the beach with the rest of their kids while they got to peep at the young wolves: &#34;Cute asses!&#34; I can&#39;t wait to mess with him telling him about how thirsty his mom and auntie have become!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup! Since we were pups! We would go with our friends as a little pack feeling ever more feral, it really helps to be so connected to your wolf at that age during training. You learn to go on all day treks like today with just your gifts and instincts to gide you.&#34; She puts some pinkish sauce on the tostones with the scent of mayonnaise, ketchup and garlic and I try it as well... Uff! I live in paradise!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We ALWAYS had to be cautious as kids, especially around the borders, and all of us had our parents linking us to make sure we were ok.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We saw a bunch of kids running in packs just like she said, we even saw other pups who couldn&#39;t shift yet, riding horses and some were on dirt bikes. Regardless of age, everyone enjoys their life without the worries of the outside world touching them, allowing them to grow up fearless, bolder and more in tune with the power of their wolf, yet their education reigns in the beast giving them full control over that unbridled power! Today, as much as I loved every minute of it, was my first lesson on my new way of thinking.</p>
