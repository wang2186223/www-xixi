                <p>Bayoán POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swear she heard me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Izzy goes at it: &#34;Maco I will leave you to help with your mate and figure out what she needs of you and us now, we will figure anything else out when she wakes up which even if it&#39;s slowly it will happen, that has already been assured. Ana, finish making sure that the rest of the patients that are unconscious are being treated so that we indeed can avoid using anesthesia. Keep administering the potion through their IV, it will continue to accelerate the healing process even if their wolves or prime animal is incapacitated. Sandro, go to the patients that are awake, bring your apprentices, make sure they are your most gifted ones, this will be a good learning experience. I want to make sure that they have enough credits to be graduated before the year is over, if we get Karaya back we&#39;re going to need therapists help the survivors of this massacre. Oh and Sandro there IS a vampire among them, he is under Legal Trust so don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s under my protection and his clan will be informed, although I feel that that really won&#39;t matter. Also, Cleo!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Cleo runs over, her &#39;fro tied in the back with a cornrow crown keeping it neat in the front, her obsidian eyes showing the devastation of loosing her father and Admiral yesterday, damn, we have so much appointments to do... Ugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cacique!&#34; And the young soldier bows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cleo first, my condolences, your father served Karaya with honor, I know you and your brothers will honor his legacy.&#34; After having have been Ambassador for the Goddess, Izzy was in her element with diplomacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cleo, there are humans among the victims, can you handle making sure that they are returned? Ana has the Forgetting Potion. If any are indeed runaways bring them to the Beta, he will know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will be as you say Cacique!&#34; And she bows and goes to her task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoa! When the fuck did THIS happen! If my mind is thinking fast it looks like she is a computer! Ok, that IS dramatic, but no wonder she needed me! With no one as her Beta, HER brain had to develop the Beta analyzing process so that she could continue her work without any hiccups in the way. Morgana is going to have my head for this! I AM a Jackass! No wonder Ura was indeed threatening me, and no, nobody can tell me that he was just joking... He was protecting his favorite sister but couldn&#39;t do it himself because he is a Gamma. No matter how much work and training or being the son of an Alpha and a Beta, the Goddess has assigned him as a Gamma just like Izzy. He will never be a Beta, unlike with the title of Alpha, NOBODY can be turned into a Beta, you can only be BORN into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why won&#39;t it matter Cacique? Surely their clans will want their kin back?&#34; Sandro takes the tablet with the records of every victim, their pictures, species, their powers and abilities, their captors, their story, their wounds, the atrocities committed to them, and more crap I wasn&#39;t able to see. I&#39;m going to check it out latter and verify if it&#39;s more effective than my process, if it is, I am going to have to study it, adapt to it and perfect it, that&#39;s how the Pack survives... fuck me! She thought of everything!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightens herself up trying to look dignified, who is she kidding, she really looks like shit! &#34;Most say that they have been cast out of their tribes, or are running away from an already abuser, and so many rogues all those scents are overwhelming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Alpha, I am confining you to your room for the next two hours, I&#39;m taking over. Yaya you had a nice nap yesterday assist the Alpha give her some Hayan drops for two hours. I already noticed the unicorns, I&#39;m sure that you have contacted Moira to hand them over, inform her that I recommend a full sweep of this territory I would feel more confident if she would open an investigation and send Priestesses to read the energies of the four cardinal sections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also tell her that we demand to open an investigation of the events of the past 48 hours, nobody is going to convince me that what happened yesterday was natural, that&#39;s bullshit and you all know it! Tell her that Karaya needs Avalon to step up! I know you and Izzy have a mind field avoidance plan, very cute... Well sorry, but I say fuck that! We have been directly attacked and we KNOW by whom. Ana call in everyone and tell Daniella to pull them from their shifts and organize it following this same coding system for the victims that have been brought in by Blood Moon, just transfer a copy to your tablet then give it back to Sandro so he can follow the Cacique&#39;s order.&#34; And I hand her the tablet from Sandro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yaya, make sure Moira understands I&#39;m not fucking around, we have served Avalon for centuries and have followed Selene&#39;s will and will continue to do so, we need their support. You and Izzy are not enough! We need more Priestesses to guard ALL of the Cardinal Temples and shrines around Karaya. I want a barrage of Priestesses investigating the mountain from top to bottom, although I&#39;m pretty sure the top is more than enough. If blood magic was committed, it was done there. We are the real last bastion Selene has on the planet and if we are attached then so was she, I imagine that&#39;s why she went ahead and just crowned Izzy. I have a STRONG feeling Moira will cooperate, whether she likes it or not it&#39;s in the best interest of Avalon...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also make sure she understands what is going on here. Slavery is an unforgivable crime punishable by Death only, I want to make sure she doesn&#39;t leave any equipment she wishes to use on the accused behind... You&#39;re all dismissed, especially you Alpha. Now can ANYBODY cover up that broken altar, it&#39;s creeping the shit out of me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ok, I can do this! I just called the Goddess twice by her name, that should get her attention to make sure Moira falls in line. I am not in the mood for her Priestess riddles and jibber jabber hidden knowledge crap. If Moira doesn&#39;t hand over The Sword of Peace to execute the slavers I&#39;ll consider her suspicious too. If they are executed by any other way their soul will rech Selene&#39;s realm which I doubt she will view with favor. If beheaded By The Sword of Peace that King Arthur took out from the anvil which killed him by Mordred&#39;s hand the soul of the executed will go directly to Hades to do as he will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you crazy?! To call the Goddess by her name TWICE and DEMAND The Sword of Peace? Yaya and I had a plan!&#34; I feel Izzy&#39;s anger through our new Bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look I HAVE been called crazy often Loiza! It&#39;s part of my genius and you are off duty! I&#39;m making sure that the Goddess doesn&#39;t take her eyes away from this situation. Don&#39;t forget she is the Goddess of the Moon, and the Moon has many phases, do you think that I am ignorant of the ways of Avalon? I may not be a Priestess Iza but all Betas of the Osupa are required to have full knowledge of Avalon Law, and EVERYTHING I have demanded falls well between our rights and due process. Now go take a shower and take the drops, I will send guards to care for you and wake you up in a couple of hours.&#34; She sighs...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yaya won&#39;t talk to Moira with &#39;demands&#39;...&#34; She says now eating a some grapes from a bowl full of fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She won&#39;t have to, I could feel her apprehension to my Beta order on how to handle The Great Grand Prime Priestess of Avalon A.K.A The Lady of the Lake, Moira of the House of Aranda... don&#39;t worry about it I&#39;ll tell her myself!&#34; I tell her smiling and crossing my arms on my chest, she stops chewing almost choking with a piece of cantaloupe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your joking! You wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34; She drinks some water clearing her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Izzy, YOU and Yaya wouldn&#39;t dare... I have no problem debating Avalon Law AND Warewolf High Council Law with Moira and she very damn well knows it! Now enough bullshit and go! I&#39;ll make sure Moira sends Priestesses to investigate what&#39;s happening and dry those skins of last nights hunt and the meat will be given to Domingo to make an honor feast for the dead and the bones will be given to Master Jorel to integrate to the drums and make the hunt as clean as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jumps and throws her arms around my neck... &#34;Thank you, it was feeling really lonely.&#34; She whispers in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, I&#39;m sorry Izz I should have come back after the hunt... we were done pretty fast, even Ura gave me shit about it. I got your back sweetheart now go and rest.&#34; She kissed my cheek and I muacked her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I link her: &#39;Izzy did you &#39;hear&#39; my assessment of Maco and his mate?&#39; She nods &#39;And I agree, why?&#39; Well this is new... &#39;Because you shouldn&#39;t be able to, but I have a feeling that&#39;s my fault as well, since you had no Beta, your brain adapted faster than I would have imagined to have to analyze like a Beta, and now because of it our Alpha/Beta Bond is more in sync because you have already felt what Beta brain waves feel like. You&#39;ll understand eventually, Dad would have been very impressed.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s great...&#34; She says very unenthusiastically and twirling her finger in little circles. &#34;Where IS Ura I haven&#39;t seen him since last I saw you?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sulking away somewhere I&#39;ll find him, now no more bullshit, GO and take Maco with you!&#34; She sticks out her tongue and I give her the finger and all is right in the world...</p>
