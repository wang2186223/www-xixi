                <p>Benjamin&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AHHHH! No matter where we live you&#39;re still a jerk Ben!&#34; He&#39;s got to be kidding me! James always does this in training! His mom is a Kappa and Chef Yolanda got an interest in her and decided to take her in as an apprentice and he and his family got the perks of living at The Fort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Jeremy and I go to school here because Uncle Umbros talked to the Cacique, we get the perk of getting to study and train here too! We could have moved to the house if we wanted, but Mom and Dad didn&#39;t want to impose. I don&#39;t know what the fuss is about, Jeremy and me love our apartment and it&#39;s great not having to share a bedroom! Besides, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re not at the house every time we can to play with Inaaya. Before we came here Ina already warned us that they train at beast level mode and her training is even harder because she&#39;s a Beta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why am I a Jerk Jimmy? Because I beat you? That&#39;s the whole point!&#34; Master Cahuey stopped us and Healers Estefanía and Varónica come to check on both Jimmy and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine James! It&#39;s just a broken femur, we can fix that fast, let&#39;s take a time out but as you get used to the pain your body will start numbing it out and wait till you&#39;re able to shift! But pain is a part of it mi cielo, ok?&#34; Healer Verónica calmly explained... Even Mom told us this! What a crybaby! Before we started school we saw how the kids here play and they go all out! Mom was a little upset at first, but Dad likes how we&#39;re being trained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn! If Adam and I would have been trained like that... Shit, no wonder we&#39;re getting our asses handed to us! You boys pay attention to EVERYTHING Master Cahuey instructs, do you hear me?!&#34; We gave the only acceptable answer to that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir!&#34; Mom chuckled, she&#39;s a Delta and even she says that her training is hard, but she&#39;s not upset anymore. Master Cahuey sends a report to everyone&#39;s Mom and Dad about how we&#39;re doing every two weeks and they seem happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something personal between you two?&#34; Ugh! This is embarrassing! The other kids aren&#39;t making such a big deal and now they&#39;re all looking at us! Ina got beat to a pulp and she was holding her tears as much as she could like the champ she is! I still couldn&#39;t avoid holding her hand while both her and her opponent Zoé were being healed, still they hugged after and they went at it again! Bayoán has been giving her some pointers on some Beta moves and even giving us cool strategies! But Jeremy and me get our special pointers from Maco and Ura they are Gammas like us and the Cacique herself was born a Gamma! Now Ura has to teach all of us how to hunt and track because Jeremy beat him at Call of Duty! But the best part of our day right now is helping Santino and his buddies with a new video game they&#39;re developing on the side!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s just a jerk!&#34; Jimmy said. My brother looks at me signaling at the other kids, they&#39;re gonna think everyone from Blood Moon is like this! Ugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master Cahuey there&#39;s nothing personal between us, it&#39;s just that we never hung out together before and don&#39;t know each other that much! Jimmy I didn&#39;t do it because I don&#39;t like you or anything I promise!&#34; He looks at Healer Verónica and she nods and takes him to the clinic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have no enemies here! That doesn&#39;t mean that there won&#39;t be pain! Part of your training isn&#39;t just to defeat your partner but to conquer your pain! You must learn to accept that pain and still fight through it as if the attack is REAL! As if your life depends on that control because trust me, there will come a day when it will! The match is over when one cannot continue and has to be healed, listen to your wolf! Even if you can&#39;t shift yet, your wolf already knows how to help you heal, listen to it&#39;s natural instinct and allow it to guide you. Our wolves grant us with insight that our human is still trying to understand at your young age... And yes sometimes they say stupid stuff that&#39;s absolutely embarrassing and we can&#39;t believe we share a mind with them!&#34; We all laugh! It&#39;s funny because it&#39;s true! Oh boy, sometimes I can&#39;t believe the stuff Kota comes up with!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;However, pay attention, they sometimes catch something you don&#39;t, ok guys? You&#39;re all dismissed for today.&#34; My favorite words of the day!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh! I couldn&#39;t go for another round with Zoé! You&#39;re really trying to kill me!&#34; Zoé gives her a hurt look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m not! That&#39;s mean Ina, what will the new boy think if he heard that?! He&#39;s really cute!&#34; Zoé says with a sly smile looking around. Wait, what new boy? I look at Jeremy questionaly and he shrugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What new boy?&#34; We all train together with different Masters but clases are in different rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well we have a new Beta taking classes with us and he&#39;s here with his brother and little cousin. Tía Lola said that their daddy is helping us and Izzy let his family come here to keep them safe.&#34; Ina says looking around. Dad has warned us to not call the Cacique by her name even though she said we could, but Dad likes to keep things formal. Him, Mom and Uncle Adam started calling her Luna the moment Alpha Kayden found out she was mated to him. And like everyone else at school so did we, right until we got here and saw her in the Throne Room. We&#39;ve only seen that kind of stuff in movies!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jimmy came back limping a bit but he&#39;s fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously Jimmy?! You know that was a fair attack! Look, I&#39;m sorry I broke your bone are you ok now?&#34; He sits on the grass and lays back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up Benjamin! Damn it! It hurt like Hades! I&#39;m sorry too, did everyone stare for long? I hope nobody tells my Dad!&#34; If someone told MY Dad that I acted like that I KNOW my butt would be TOAST!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah they were staring!&#34; Zoé tells him looking at him shaking her head. &#34;Dude you have to understand, we&#39;re not used to taking sparing personally here! You were totally embarrassing!&#34; Jimmy covered his face totally ashamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;UGH! PLEASE nobody tell my Dad!&#34; Oh brother!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We won&#39;t Jimmy, but a lot of others saw.&#34; Jeremy simply tells him. Him and his Dad are Deltas, Master Cahuey is starting to pair us up with partners of different ranks to also learn their particular fighting forms, tomorrow I&#39;m supposed to spar with Soleil and she&#39;s a Beta and is just as good as her cousin Zoé... I can&#39;t wait to see if I survive them! Ina can still kick my butt most times!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So where are these new kids?&#34; I ask anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you guys talking about? By the Goddess Jimmy, was all that necessary?! Would you guys really complain like that back at Blood Moon? We never saw how you guys trained.&#34; Soleil comes over with her older brother Miguel... THAT&#39;S a sparing match I definitely need to level up big time to be able to beat him! At 13, he can already beat some Alphas! Him, Soleil and Zoé are all Betas and are all cousins of Beta Víctor. While Zoé is daughter of Professor Ibarra, Miguel and Soleil are Madam Miguelina&#39;s great grandkids, through Selena, who&#39;s Gadiel and Rubén&#39;s older sister and is mated to Beta Víctor&#39;s cousin Mabó del Valle. Uncle Umbros told us that he is one of the best infiltrators the pack has, and is running for a Senate seat back home! Jeremy and I definitely want to get stronger to be able to join OPIA!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can it Soleil! I said I&#39;m sorry ok! Oh man, even if my brother hears about this he&#39;s going to totally mess with me!&#34; Miguel gave him a little kick with his foot for giving his sister lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax Jimmy, geez! Soleil, Papi already told us about how it&#39;s going to take them time to adapt, but seriously Jimmy, you&#39;re going to have to overcome the pain man. What are you going to do if there ever IS an attack and the grownups are focused on protecting US? We all die! The way they protect us the best is by teaching us to defend ourselves. Dude we can help you with extra practice! We don&#39;t care where you were born, but you&#39;re an Osupa Warrior NOW, that means a lot to our pack and we totally gotta work with your street cred!&#34; Miguel tells him with a scowl. But your reputation in the pack is super important! The Cacique is who she is today because of her reputation. Santino is the same age she was when she had her encounter with Bayo and their Dad and I doubt he could do something so cool! And that video is proof that Gammas can use any fighting forms, Ina has been trying out Epsilon moves but we have to be faster to achieve them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks Miguel, can it be Saturday? My leg is still healing.&#34; Miguel already looks like he regrets the offer but he pouts and nods at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;FINE! but only EARLY and only one hour! I like having REAL fun on my weekends!&#34; We ALL do! I still remember the day we got here and we got to The Fort it was dawn on a Saturday and kids were already playing soccer on the huge lawn at the entrance! We would wake up early at Blood Moon, but this was &#39;Yule Morning&#39; early! But we totally get it now! We work hard on weekdays so EVERY weekend is treated like a HOLIDAY!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There are so many festivals, we get to run horses and checking out the paths that we&#39;ll be able to run when we turn 16 and can shift, learning how to surf and we still haven&#39;t tried so many things! We don&#39;t have to hide what we are here. The best weekend we had was when we went on a run with the Cacique and the rest of the Mirabals and Ina&#39;s family through the island! Us kids got to ride on the grownups! They showed us the coolest waterfalls and swimming holes, where to find fruits and vegetables we were allowed to take without getting into trouble, which type of fish and birds our wolves will find find fun and yummy to hunt and eat, it was so much fun! Our family has never done anything like that before, not in so much territory, not without our guards up at every minute, not with so many family members... It&#39;s like we were a pack of our own! It went late into the night, we had a fire and the Cacique, Maco and Nía found some roots they gave to Nina, Ina&#39;s grandma and the rest of the Kappas and Ura tracked down a pig and they cooked all of it, it was awesome and we slept under the stars... I&#39;m never forgetting that weekend!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So is anyone going to give us the tea? Were you guys talking about the new kids?&#34; Soleil just ignores her brother and is fiddling with her ring looking for anything interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup! Zoé thinks the one in our class is cute! I haven&#39;t seen the others.&#34; Ina says after a sip of water. Does that mean SHE doesn&#39;t find him cute?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? Ina let me tell you something about our cousin... She&#39;s totally boy crazy! By the Goddess Zoé we&#39;re just 11! Either way maybe we can invite them to go to Fortaleza Beach for a while before dinner, that way we can skip showering now!&#34; Beach? Skipping a shower? Soleil is BRILLIANT!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo, count me in! Does anyone know where they&#39;re staying?&#34; Meh, Santino still has to upgrade his game, Jeremy already finished it and it totally pissed him off... At least Ura and Maco found it funny!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, I can do without seeing my Moms right now, should we get changed really fast and meet up at the East stairwell? I think they&#39;re staying in the fourth floor not far from Luna Isla and Master Orocobix&#39;s rooms.&#34; Jimmy got up and dusted himself off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds like a plan, we meet up in five minutes, ok? Benny is it ok if I come with you guys?&#34; Since moving here we ALWAYS have an extra bathing suits in our bedroom in Uncle Adam&#39;s apartment, and Jeremy and I have finger print access except if there&#39;s a handkerchief tied to the door handle... Grownups are so weird!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure! So we&#39;re all in?!&#34; Everyone goes running to their rooms... I guess that&#39;s a yes! Jeremy, Ina and I run to the 6th floor and knock just in case. No answer. So Jeremy opens the door and we run to the extra bedroom with bunk beds for us, something about us staying with them once in a while to give Mom and Dad a break from us? Ina goes to the bathroom while Jeremy and I go to the closet were we have our stuff and we change in a rush!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ready guys! Let&#39;s go!&#34; Ina shouts from the living room. Ah, she wore her turquoise bathing suit with red stripes and shorts! She looks so pretty! She wants to cut her hair like Zoé&#39;s... I&#39;m trying to talk her out of it, but I think she can&#39;t look ugly either way and I know she&#39;s also thinking about her training. She&#39;s been studying the Cacique more and she has big goals. She wants to join OPIA too and wants to be Pack Beta one day!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s so cool! And her eyes are like Bambi&#39;s mom, she almost cought me staring at her eyelashes the other day but Jeremy totally had my back and distracted her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my Goddess! You guys are so slow!&#34; Jeremy gives me a look... Ugh! Focus Ben!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all met up and ran up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s this one guys, I checked with my Mom!&#34; Miguel said pointing towards the West Wing, I think those apartments have a view to The Mermaid Lagoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok but will everyone calm down? We look like trick or treaters and we have no idea what they find rude or not.&#34; Excellent point made by Soleil. And she fixes her hair and knocked on the door and it was opened by a pretty lady with straight long brown hair.</p>
