                <p>After closing the door she turns to me, she takes a good look at me as I look at her. She was so chatty and yet now she&#39;s quiet... It&#39;s making me a bit nervous. The moment I took a step to go to her she puts up a finger. Is she a reader?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She goes and gets a bottle of tequila and a couple of shoot glasses and pours without breaking eye contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Marcus, right? Kayden&#39;s brother?&#34; She takes a shot and hands me one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah... Natalia?&#34; She pours again. This is not what I expected would happen when I found my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup, that would be me!&#34; And takes the shoot. She signals me to a living area... This room is not as massive as Loiza&#39;s, but damn, it&#39;s big! I sit next to her, after waiting for this day I don&#39;t know what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus... I like it! It has this Roman Emperor vibe...&#34; I fucking think she IS a reader. She is is so beautiful! Her eyes are haunting!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love the sound of yours Natalia... It sounds like a Bond Villain!&#34; Ugh! WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FUCK. MARCUS! But she&#39;s laughing her ass off!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy shit! Now THAT is a SMOOTH pickup line if I ever heard one!&#34; How does this fucking Bond work?! Shouldn&#39;t I be able to adjust to her?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus, I&#39;m not a reader if you were asking yourself that. I&#39;m just very good at picking on very specific gestures and scents among other things, also information is my biggest trade. I already adore you! From the Bond, the intel I have on you and from what I can see, I know that you have been waiting for me. I know that you have stayed true to me. I have realized that THIS moment was VERY important for you. Marcus, I haven&#39;t been like you on that regard... Am I still ok? Did I ruin it? I&#39;m sorry... I promise to make it up to you if you let me.&#34; Oh my Goddess! The look of worry in her makes my heart ache! FUCK THIS! I stand up and pick her up straddling me. She gave a little yelp and wrapped her arms around my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve been an idiot putting such high expectations, that I hurt her anyway by making her feel like she didn&#39;t meet them! And now I realize that she&#39;s Loiza&#39;s cousin who is a FUCKING Master Negotiator and field op, is just PERFECTLY fine as hell and MINE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit her on the bed and I stand over her with my arms at each side of her my face pressed to her own, her eyes are such a peculiar blue! Like indigo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen to me Natalia, it&#39;s bullshit either way! I just fucking realized that you&#39;re the negotiator right? How many lives have you and your team saved this year alone? I have been looking at all of Loiza&#39;s pieces on her board and she sees you as a rook! Do you play chess Tali, you seem like the type?&#34; Her slight pupil dilation gave her away, I didn&#39;t need her answer she already gave it to me. Before she could answer I just kissed her. My mate tastes so sweet! Two can play that game sweetheart, and I&#39;m already very excited to play with you!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you do I guess you see why she sees you as a rook, it&#39;s her favorite piece right? And there it is again but in the way she took her breath. She didn&#39;t have to answer, I kissed her even deeper. She just looked and smiled, she already knows that I&#39;m on to her! Oh yes, she&#39;s perfect!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess since I don&#39;t have to give you any answers for anything we can just move along shall we?&#34; She pushes me off of her and just takes off her shirt and her bra and everything else then goes to the shower, she turns around and looks at me. She&#39;s not as slender as I thought! Her breasts are a very good size and that ass! Wilk and I are salivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you just come from a flight too? Baby I just came from a mission! Trust me, I want to get all this grime off... I say we have a nice shower so strip and get your cute ass in here! Let me give you a proper Karaya welcome.&#34; Fuck yeah! I just strip and obey her. Ok focus Marcus! The moment I get in she takes her already soapy hands around my already hard dick stroking each hand in contrary motions to each other... FUCK! I almost came right then! The electricity around my shaft was intense!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby, don&#39;t hold it, ok? I want you to relax and TRUST me I KNOW how to get you hard again FAST!&#34; I released and it&#39;s HEAVEN!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t stop... It was TORTURE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;TALIAAAA!&#34; But she didn&#39;t stop. She looked at me with those haunting eyes and AGAIN I came HARDER! I almost buckled before I caught myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok hot stuff... Now you&#39;re a little bit more relaxed for ME...&#34; She scrubs me up and she puts my hands on her. I clean her down touching my woman all over and she keeps allowing me to do whatever I want. She hands me a towel with this huge grin of triumph and I KNOW I&#39;m blushing like a motherfucker! Ugh! Again her laughter! She kissed my neck deeply, I hope she Marks me there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we&#39;re drying ourselves she gives me a mischievous smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t stop looking at him! I thought I was going to be like my mom and never find my mate. She traveled so much, but nothing, and she has always refused to say who our father is, all we know is he is father to all three of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since getting the reports of what transpired at Blood Moon while I was in France, I have been studying the pack and it&#39;s key players. And after what happened in London, Lola gave me more insight, however I would have never guessed that I would be mated to Marcus! He is not my usual go to. I am usually a sucker for the tall, dark and handsome, I don&#39;t remember hooking up with a blond... But he IS a gorgeous! Since we have met his eyes have already changed three shades! I have always found magic in hazel eyes and he is VERY similar to his brother. I can tell he&#39;s nervous, he&#39;s so cute! I also know that he is very meticulous and has a keen eye for detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you thinking beautiful?&#34; He asks as he wraps his towel around his waist and coming to help dry my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you could already read me so you tell me.&#34; Those involuntary reactions made him a bit cocky so I upped my control game, I want to mate and Mark him ASAP, but I never was a saint, I never cared about having a relationship. I wasn&#39;t like Lola, Bayo, Maco or Izz, but this is my mate and I already feel so much for him... I KNOW he won&#39;t reject me. I just feel very insecure at the moment... I didn&#39;t expect to feel this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talia, I&#39;m not a reader and maybe I can get some of your tells, but I&#39;m still adapting sweetheart.&#34; His face looked so blue. No! I don&#39;t want to see him like that! I take his arms that are drying me, allowing the towel fall, and wrap myself in them. He holds me tighter kissing my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tatiana had already told me about your nervous breakdown and how you were saving yourself for your mate... Seriously, why would The Council give all this nonsense information? When you find your mate the Bond helps you get over past relationships your mate had. I&#39;m also sorry that your mom didn&#39;t explain... Marcus, I&#39;m just trying to understand and not disappoint you. I&#39;ve been to many packs and know how outsiders think.&#34; He gave me a complicated look and I felt his anxiety through the Bond when I mentioned his breakdown and his mother. He held me tighter like if I was going to run away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no mother.&#34; He said bitterly as he rested his chin on my shoulder. I rake my fingers through his blonde curls, everything I have read about him says that he&#39;s a Beta with exceptional potential and that he&#39;s an all-round good guy... How did I get so lucky? Besides his looks, smarts and personality, he&#39;s very well endowed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for mentioning her Love. Marcus, YOU are not HER nor your father, do you understand me? Nobody in this pack holds blame towards you or Kayden. We have been working as hard as possible to get you guys HERE.&#34; I turn around and take his sweet face in my hands, he looked so embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus, I guess the Goddess thinks I need to be more sensitive and you more vocal... You are MY mate and I am YOURS.&#34; He looks at me with his mournful eyes, now with a slight blue hue surrounded by caramel. I kiss his lips with open eyes, I don&#39;t want to miss a thing and I unwrap his towel and let it fall, he wraps one arm around my waist and cups my face with his other hand and deepens our kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s ok he&#39;s a virgin, I have done enough to guide him. I rake one hand down his sculpted chest and I already feel his arousal. None of the men or women I&#39;ve been before has treated me with this tenderness, I used to think it was cheesy but now I feel overwhelmed by his love. I want him to feel special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus, make love to me and claim me, we have a lifetime and I&#39;m not going anywhere, ok?&#34; He presses his forehead to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalia...&#34; And he picked me up, I am allowing him to have it his way... My first time was awful, I want his to be memorable. He laid me on the bed and we made out for a bit until he felt comfortable enough to take his fingers down town... I was so wet for him. I wanted him NOW! Yet Cordelia was enjoying his gentleness and his eyes changed from it&#39;s blue hue to pale green, still with the caramel outer iris... My voice broke at the realization that green is his happy color and my moans started a crescendo as he started eating me. It was soft and sweet and I felt like in a trance. He traced kisses up my body and once again I am enraptured by the green in his eyes as I feel him entering me. He&#39;s a little nervous but my eyes are locked to his reassuring him that I am HIS, to not be afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok? Do you like it?&#34; I ask softly and he nods as he pushes himself inside me more and I catch his rhythm. Oh my Goddess! This is way better than anything else I had before! My arms are wound up thigh around his massive back as he picks up more strength and speed to his thrusts turning my moans to an orgasm that wouldn&#39;t end. And his growls of pleasure were making it more intense. He keeps pounding me harder, my brain is syncing with his and I feel he will come soon, I feel Cordelia getting ready to Mark him the second he Marks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talia... I love you, you&#39;re exactly what I wanted.&#34; He says whispering and panting hoarsely in my ear as he came and out of nowhere his canines are out and he claims me! Whoa, now I understand when Nina told me it wasn&#39;t like a regular fuck! I&#39;m disoriented and trying to grab my bearings and yet I see the place I wanted to put my mark and I lunge for it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We laid there for a bit, his head is on my chest while he is in my arms as we caught our bearings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We started looking through the Bond and let the early afternoon sunlight bathe us. I started playing with his curls as he took my other hand and took it to his lips, he is so peaceful yet looking through the Bond I know combat and blood are no strangers to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hungry my love? This is your home, I&#39;ll show you how to link up with anyone in the kitchens and you can have anything you want or we can go there.&#34; There&#39;s no way he&#39;s going anywhere! He&#39;s my mate and his place is with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks up at me with a serene smile and the green in his eyes is now emerald like Morgana&#39;s! He&#39;s MINE and I know that those eyes are going to be the end of me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am... But I don&#39;t want food right now.&#34; He started suckling and licking my nipples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t care to remember how many times we made love but eventually the lovemaking and how tired we were from everything that came before got the better of us and I remember falling asleep in his arms as we just chatted about anything. I don&#39;t remember ever sleeping so soundly...</p>
