                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think I&#39;m in a dream I smell him so closely!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza! Wake up! You must Wake up now child!&#34; What the hell? I&#39;m awake! Seriously do I ever get to rest around here?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop with your witty comebacks in your head do you think I never hear them?!&#34; Oh uh! And HE&#39;S RIGHT THERE! I stand up in attention immediately and throw my arms around his neck and he takes me up in his arms and kisses me! I feel so much energy rush over my body the moment I touch him. But I feel something is different yet familiar at the same time. He can&#39;t stop kissing me but Moira coughs to interrupt us!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lord this thing must be done, but first we must tell her some basics. Or else we can overwhelm her you know how this works.&#34; My Lord? What the hell is going on here? Like seriously can&#39;t I have one day for a damn break?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy I swear to the Goddess why is it that you find the joke and something funny in everything even moments that are serious?!&#34; Oh man! I have a clap back for that too my brain is still working a mile a minute from earlier! Wow, Moira is FOCUSED! And I can&#39;t stop myself from laughing because I know she&#39;s going to know! So why the hell not! And I don&#39;t see any point on hiding from Kayden. She faced palms herself and he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does she have a clap back for that too?&#34; He asks smiling calmly. Okay I&#39;m starting to freak out here what&#39;s going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She does My Lord, same as always, you will start to remember soon. She is as you have always loved her.&#34; Her insistence on calling him My Lord is unsettling. Just because he is the Goddesses&#39;s Executioner does not Grant him the title of Lord. And she can see that I&#39;m already putting the pieces of the puzzle together and she yells me to &#39;STOP!&#39; and I literally feel my brain stopped working! Was that an Alpha command?! And now I start to become nervous without my mind I am nothing! Kaden comes to hold me so that I calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moira&#39;s light of serenity is shining very bright! I don&#39;t ever remember seeing it that bright! My heart felt as light as a feather and with Kayden holding me completely filling with his warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza we came to bring down the Block it is time it must be done now!&#34; I feel the sudden fright... Wait a minute, I thought that&#39;s what I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy, listen to me this is how it&#39;s always been, you will understand soon but you must trust us. He is your mate! And I have guided you since you were a child, no matter how how much you ever joked, or those joyrides to the Úngar Plains to ride unicorns, yes I knew! I have done everything according to how the gods commanded me... All three of them.&#34; Three? Who is the other? And then I remember behind my neck and I look at Kayden... wait! My eyes were as saucers, my hand to the back of my neck...! Didn&#39;t I always think that he did look like the representation of the descriptions of the god Apollo? There must be something in my calculations earlier, I REALLY fucked up, my brain must be FRIED!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m looking at him square in the eyes and I can almost feel it... it&#39;s right in the tip of my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He takes my hand in his and kisses them gently it relaxes me again trying not to break eye contact, his heat warming me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay Moira order them to lower the block completely!&#34; He ordered her. I start FEELING for HIM STRONGLY again. I&#39;m just looking straight into his eyes and breathing deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Love you cannot keep that on, if you keep waiting it will consume you the moment it does come off, it has to be now. Never before have we had to face this problem. Ok?&#34; I nod yet not understanding yet, I feel so close!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izz look into the Bond, the mist on my side will start clearing off and you&#39;re going to be able to see many strings. To hasten this I specifically highlighted ONE, I need you to reach for it sweetheart okay? I&#39;m right here Moira&#39;s right here as well.&#34; Okay what rabbit hole did I walk into?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LOIZA!&#34; Moira hisses!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hades FINE! Ok, yellow?!&#34; I hate it when everybody gets so damn cryptic why can&#39;t anybody just say what they have to say?! I look again into his eyes and focus, I go into the Bond and I do see very clearly now thousands of strings from me to him and one is highlighted in yellow, I reach out for it and it&#39;s the image of myself in the tiara! I let go and start hyperventilating! I start to panic! HE WILL FIND ME! I&#39;D RATHER DIE! The ocean outside roaring more furiously! And once again Moira turns her light of serenity as strong as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izz, Love you have only focused on it from YOUR perspective, you are my mate, you&#39;re also going to have to learn to see it through MY own eyes. You&#39;re going to have to look again and see through my eyes what I SEE when I see that image. C&#39;mon &#39;code name Raven&#39;, you can&#39;t tell me that after what you guys pulled off this morning you can&#39;t do THIS!&#34; I feel calm again yet my apprehension persists but not for Kayden, however I feel like I need to see. It&#39;s driving this crescendo of needs that I am about to find something that I have been looking for a long time. So I surrender and go in again and reach out at the yellow string. And I see the image again and I feel no fear, I feel devotion, I feel nostalgia, yearning, longing, it brings back of memory of a long time ago when we had at the manor overlooking the Aegean Sea. He didn&#39;t want me to be away from what I love and I have always loved the sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let go of them both I look at Moira and then I look at him. I walk to him looking at him up and down... It&#39;s right there, he already knows, he&#39;s awakened first but puts me in charge of this part! Why does he always do this?! No matter how many times I teach him! And I look at him again and I gulp hard. I&#39;m getting dizzy, Kayden holds me as I almost buckle. So many memories flowing in me with the strength of The Nile! MY HEAD!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AHHH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME!&#34; There&#39;s joy, but so much PAIN!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moira shines her Mark even more, Kayden holds me tying to still my emotions and I inhale the sent of fresh rain and pine and now I catch it, that nutty scent of sunflowers! That&#39;s the scent of Helios... My son? I&#39;m so confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lord, maybe I can get Gai--&#34; He shushed her! Kayden is shushing Moira? Not Kayden... Ugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Breathe Love, focus on the sound of my voice... Remember who you are! Loiza, why did you Mark me on my shoulder?&#34; I close my eyes and keep inhaling his scent... Why DID I Mark his shoulder? Aryn is purring with the voice of whale song! I focus on the growing roar of the ocean... It beckons me. I let go of Kayden and walk to the balcony...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loi--!&#34; And he shushed her again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is why I made sure that in spite of the risks, everytime she would be close to the sea... She loves to sea let it guide her!&#34; I look back at him and he encourages me to go on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk onto the balcony and look down at the waters... Massive pods of Orcas, dolphins and other porpoises and whales are singing, talking in their different languages and accents! I hear them welcoming me back... I can&#39;t stop looking at them. I feel my eyes taking in their beauty... Orcas... Aryn...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I am remembering Izz! That&#39;s why he chose me as your wolf! To remind you of the Orcas, we used to...&#39; &#39;... Protect them!&#39; Just like his golden horses pulled his chariot, it was the Orcas who pulled mine made of nácar! WHO AM I?&#34; I look back at him and he is sitting on one of the couches sitting cross legged resting his head on his hand glaring intensely at me, waiting patiently for my brain to click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Moira leave us! Give instructions to the Betas that the Cacique isn&#39;t to be interrupted by anyone, then go to Blood Moon and explain to my brother that I will return soon to get the pack. Explain to them the risks of staying in Virginia and the safety of coming here and how VERY compromised and devoted Avalon is with protecting Karaya... I hope I don&#39;t have to instruct you on HOW to go about it!&#34; He is giving full commands and instructions to Moira in a very calm tone, and yet, I&#39;m not stunned by it anymore, she leaves following his command...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He has ALWAYS been like this. I look at the ocean again, I hear their calls, the clicks! I see SEALS swimming to the rocks below their own voices joining the chanting and the clear waters turn into a rainbow of fishes of every color swimming around the pods. The Mermaids join in the song in their own native language... I understand them ALL!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Queen Amphitrite! Mother!&#39; And I gasp taking in the air like if I was a fish out of water making me fall to the floor! He was by my side at once cradling me helping me catch my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember Love? That&#39;s why they always follow you, remember, it&#39;s because of you they breathe air!&#34; What does it matter... They are still hunted, giving them that trait was to give them an edge for THEM to hunt and look at what they have done to my most treasured creatures! I feel their fear and pain. So much like wolves, the pod is life! All pieces of one puzzle, not only did I grant them the ability to breathe air, I gave them the ability to love, to strategize, to work in unity, to feel pleasure when they mate... Amphitrite, that&#39;s my name, he would just call me Phi! I look up at HIM! I KNOW HIM!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apollo?!&#34; I say softly. He takes me in his arms and crashes his lips upon me.</p>
