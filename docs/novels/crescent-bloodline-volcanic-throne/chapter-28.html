                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am leaning on the medical tent when I see the sun raising in the East, sigh... I can&#39;t believe only 24 hours have passed. I see Jolene and Kendra coming over with a tray?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lady we know that you have been hella busy, so we brought you breakfast, how do you like your coffee?&#34; Jolene asks. And Kendra is bringing a chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Black, no sugar.&#34; I answer. Jolene goes to get the coffee and Kendra brings a little table and prepares a plate serving different things. I am so tired I just look at the girls at their work. Yaya walks out of the tent she must be spent as well...I motion Kendra to serve Yaya as well, I will talk with their parents today. I rather we take them with us to Avalon so that they can start to train there. Whatever happens they will be safe in Avalon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are they doing?&#34; I ask Yaya now with coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just like they did 20 minutes ago when you left and yes Maco is still by his mate. Poor boy, to finally find your mate in such a state, she will recover Izzy, Ana herself is taking care of her. She did recommend we wake Sandro to care for Maco&#34; Great! Maco is out for now, shit I can&#39;t bitch about this, I am PISSED at Kayden, but he didn&#39;t know, sure we met under harsh circumstances, but what Maco is going through is torture. Anacaona is an extremely talented healer, Maco&#39;s nameless mate is in excellent hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I link Sandro and I know I woke him...&#39;Alpha! Good morning, how can I serve you?&#39; I feel so bad for getting him up at this hour. &#39;Sandro please forgive me for waking you at this hour, we had an incident during the night and I desperately need your skill right now. Can you please come to the medical tent as soon as possible?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;At once Cacique! I am on my way.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, every victim has been triaged and catalogued by species.&#34; I stretch my hand up to get the tablet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;General sit, have some coffee.&#34; I get up to give him a break. And I jump when he takes a knee before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cacique PLEASE don&#39;t stand. You have already overexerted yourself, please continue to rest.&#34; I keep standing and I just use my Alpha command...&#34;Sit General!&#34; He stood then sat. &#34;Jo, get him coffee please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes My Lady at once, how do you take your coffee General?&#34; Jolene asks really happy to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With a little milk and two sugars little lady thank you.&#34; He answers. And she gives him a bright smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;General I want a detailed chart of how the military and OPIA is organized, inform Director Gloria to assist you for an informal briefing this afternoon. After you have prepared the report, you will go and take a two hour break so you can sleep, I will give you some Hayan drops, they will help you fall asleep at once and the amount will be enough for you to feel much more rested. That is an Order General.&#34; He stands and looks at me and puts his hand on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Iza, I trained you for combat, I know what you can do but you&#39;re not inmortal and nobody expects you to have godlike abilities. It&#39;s time you asked him! He OWES that and more to you, you don&#39;t have to carry this burden alone, it&#39;s not how the pack survives.&#34; He squeezes my shoulder again and walks away, he knows that that would make me misty-eyed and I would not like anyone seeing that right now. Of all of the teachers I have had in my life including Avalon, he has been the one who has come down the hardest on me... &#39;Girl, if you survived years in Avalon, I should be a piece of cake!&#39; He fucking wasn&#39;t! But he DID make me stronger and he is right, I can&#39;t do this alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Braka! Before you go, wake him and send him to me. You&#39;re dismissed.&#34; He bows and leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well aren&#39;t you the sweetest Alpha in the world! You should have offered him some bon bons while you are at it?&#34; Goddess give me patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yaya, while you were sleeping Braka was awake, I am just giving him two hours he will definitely NEED. Now get in contact with Moira, we HAVE to hand in the unicorns ASAP.&#34; She just gives me the stink eye and stands to go... &#34;Yaya? What do you think Marcus meant last night about someone cursing them? I have been thinking about that a LOT, I didn&#39;t tell you before because I thought it was related to Karaya but...&#34; &#34;... Let me guess, your Mark hasn&#39;t stoped itching has it?&#34; She asks sternly. &#34;Yeah! I have to focus on forgetting it until I find myself scratching it. Maco thought for a moment that Kayden and Marcus seemed out of it when he called on them, he thought that you would find some guilt about last night.&#34; Maco wanted to kill someone last night, Kevin has been taking those he, Marcus and Kayden have caught and put them in the dungeons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were nervous and they had guilt but not of what happened last night...well they REALLY felt terrible about having members doing such things, that boy Marcus was about to have a mental breakdown when he saw the unicorns. But that they are hiding something regarding US... they are.&#34; That&#39;s what I thought, when Marcus raged that they were cursed, Kayden was fast to pivot. Good talent for an Alpha, but not good enough to hide from a spy trained to notice the details. They were fine last night before The Run and in the span of a few hours their demeanor changed drastically. They have infomation that is key to us! Why would they not share it? I DO need him!</p>

                <p>L: &#39;Oh good! You&#39;re awake! I hope I didn&#39;t interrupt anything important, anyhoo please come to the medical tent ASAP.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>B: &#39;Izzy give me another hour.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>L: With Alpha voice: &#39;ASAP!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>B: &#39;Shit!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>L: &#39;I knew you would see it my way sooner rather than later.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>B: &#39;You and Ura are the WORST!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>L: &#39;I could always assign you to be Suania&#39;s personal trainer.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>B: &#39;For fuck sake I&#39;m coming!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, who needs my help?&#34; Sandro finally gets here... &#34;Jo, Kendra!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes My Lady?&#34; Both girls respond. &#34;I need a big favor from both of you, a personal favor.&#34; They both nod their heads. &#34;I&#39;m going to walk into the medical tent right now, I am taking Healer Sandro to the bed of a patient whom her mate needs some help, so we are going to take him away, while he is away I want both of you not to disturb the doctor  treating the girl, all I want from you guys is to help get her hair un matted. Bring a bucket, wash her hair get some good conditioner and fix her hair as best you can okay?&#34; Both girls are confused but nod their heads. &#34;All of you come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We go in and I signal the girls to stay at the entrance watching, they give me a thumbs up. Excellent. &#34;This way Sandro.&#34; I walk directly to Maco and his mate. &#34;Maco, brother, Ana will care for her now, but she needs you out of her way, do understand?&#34; I look at Sandro. &#34;It&#39;s been hours and I don&#39;t even know her name.&#34; A tear falls from each eye. My heart aches for him, he has been waiting for over a decade to meet his mate only to meet her like THIS...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sandro gets down to his level to look him in the eyes. &#34;You&#39;re right Maco, you have waited for this moment and true that the circumstances are not ideal, but your wait has ended. Come with me so we can chat over some of the aweful coffee they have in this place.&#34; I can&#39;t help but laugh, and I see Maco smiled with a little chuckle. And I feel a little hope. &#34;I know right, stupid volcano just messed with our coffee... If the damn thing wouldn&#39;t have blown up Maco would be home drinking a decent cup of coffee instead of being next to his mate.&#34; Maco laughs at that. &#34;Iza you are the worst sister on the planet.&#34; Sandro looks at me with a big open smile and I wink at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s an absolute lie and you know it! In any case that title goes to Guanina!&#34; He thinks for a second...&#34;She owes me 200 Guanins she used to buy ONE pair of shoes.&#34; Duh! You&#39;re the one who has money. Those were nice shoes too. I wanted a pair myself. But owes him much more money. &#34;That&#39;s the spirit! Let&#39;s keep hating Nina and love Izzy!&#34; He give gives me a big smile with a little laugh. &#34;You ARE the worst!&#34; And I cup his face. &#34;We don&#39;t know what she has been through brother, she will need you strong when she wakes I&#39;m sure you have felt that at least through the Bond...go with Sandro she is safe and with OUR people now. I want you looking sharp so my new sister can see what hottie she got scored for a mate!&#34; He sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get nasty coffee Sandro.&#34; He says with a woeful voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I say fuck the coffee now, let&#39;s raid the kitchen and get some beer!&#34; Sandro replies. Maco straight up laughs. &#34;Sandro your the man!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I signal the girls to come and link Ana to come. They all scurry over. &#34;Ok girls this is Dr. Ana, Doc this is Jo and this is Kendra. Girls if the doc tells you to do or stop doing something you don&#39;t ask why, you just do it, got it?&#34; They look at Maco&#39;s mate... &#34;What happened to her?&#34; They look like they have seen a ghost, I must have looked like that the first time I saw her too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not your concern right now! Focus on your task. Also I need to talk to your parents, can you link them to meet me at the Pack house?&#34; Kendra links someone but Jolene just stares at me. &#34;Jo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, about that. I don&#39;t have any. Parents I mean, neither does Kendra but she has her sister...&#34; Man, this pack is a bummer! &#34;Ok, nevermind. Kendra tell your sister to meet me as soon as she can, ok? Now both of you go and get what you need!&#34; And she nods with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes My Lady! We will get the things!&#34; And they run out. Ana looks at me like I went and lost my mind. &#34;Are you sure about this Alpha?&#34; She asks. Looking at her patient as she tied her braids into a pony tail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all.&#34; I look at Jane Doe again. &#34;Not being sure keeps me on my toes! Thank you for this Ana. Yaya has the potion ready to administer to her and anyone who needs it, I made sure to double-check it, they are labeled according to species. I have to go now, I leave her in your care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will care for her with the best of my skill Alpha.&#34; Says the young healer. I look at Yaya and she nods at me.</p>
