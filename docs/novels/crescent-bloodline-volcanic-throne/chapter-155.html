                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really hate moving, but THIS is totally worth it! I have to verify how I can bring the cars. Now that we actually have a whole pack that has fun racing it sure would have been pretty awesome to bring cars that you really can&#39;t race in Virginia! I leave the suitcases by what I know now to be the second closet and Caliburn behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to the balcony and they&#39;re having a freaking Circle right now! Paco almost finished with her first arm! She looks at me smiling padding next to her to come sit by her and I do so saying hi to everyone. At least I feel comfortable with the people I&#39;m around right now. And I&#39;m already looking through the bond to catch up at where we are at and asked to get a hit after kissing my mate, I&#39;m focusing my energy on the moment instead of her slight arousal so I actually verify what&#39;s on the table and holy shit it looks good!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You came early! I didn&#39;t expect you for at least a little bit after dark! But it&#39;s better that way, we can break you in to The Circle! It took such a... GENTLE nudge from Nina to bring Tony over!&#34; I look through her memories and I start smiling catching the gist, yeah I got this! I sent a reassurance to her that I&#39;m absolutely fine. And she&#39;s relieved. I know she loves this, and I have found myself enjoying myself through her memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Antoine how much lube did you use to sit on the Eiffel Tower man?!&#34; Either way I still am the God Apollo, I&#39;m charming as fuck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough to make sure I don&#39;t hurt myself! Either way I already knew she would probably end up doing more damage! Being an Alpha not willing to yield! It&#39;s very hard to adjust to this minefield. She relaxes me and treats me better than I would ever want, but it feels like swimming in a pool with pretty sharks! I tell you this Bond thing is ridiculous!&#34; Ha! Tell me about it! I still remember all the times she would be in a bad mood... she&#39;s of water and negotiates and adapts, but when she&#39;s done with negotiating she still brings the wrath of the ocean and typhoons. That&#39;s what makes water such a dangerous element, because of its malleability it&#39;s so unpredictable, you really never know what you&#39;re going to get next! Which also makes it very exciting! So I kind of got where he&#39;s coming from. After a few hits, some food and a few beers I&#39;m really enjoying myself. And here I am living the life, super chill just enjoying a setting Sun in front of The Caribbean and we kept ordering more food and drink letting her scent fill my soul! She is so RELAXED... I lay my head on her lap and I feel her sparking fingers massage my scalp... Oh yes, I feel like I&#39;m at home!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina, link Ura and Frey or I swear sister we&#39;re not going to hear the end of this!&#34; Nina instantly starts linking. Very good, he&#39;s ending the tattoos with mandalas... She&#39;ll need as much cosmic energy as possible. Paco goes to her other arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry I explained everything they&#39;re on their way! Kayden, it&#39;s still not the same experience without Natalia so just bear with us ok? Paco can stand in for Talia this time, Goddess knows he&#39;s just as nosey and gossipy!&#34; I wish Marcus would have been here, I should have brought him! But hey what can I say I wanted to come over to be with my mate and somebody had to take care of business. I&#39;ll bring him eventually he&#39;ll enjoy this, he really needs this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear sweetheart sometimes I don&#39;t know with you! You&#39;re accusing ME of being nosy. And don&#39;t give me shit about gossip, I know that some of you high and mighty cunts don&#39;t like it but I&#39;ve never heard any of you say shut up Paco, I don&#39;t want to hear it!&#34; We all started laughing, I&#39;m actually guilty of not only just listening but inciting!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey I admit it! I don&#39;t start any gossip train! But I don&#39;t fucking mind hearing it! If it arrives to my ears what can I do! And after coming back from Avalon I got so used to mom, Tia and Isla go at it, then I realized that this was apparently something normal here, because that doesn&#39;t happen in Avalon, everybody usually keeps intimate shit to their own! Magdalena is a year older than I am and even though I do remember her over there I don&#39;t remember anything about her because that&#39;s not how we used to go about. We work together, but I don&#39;t remember getting info on anyone that wasn&#39;t directly from them. Since moving here I know everything about everybody especially when I would visit Isla! I swear we should give her and Tía podcast!&#34; She&#39;s so cute!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey I heard that and I totally agree! Can you imagine? The Ex Director of OPIA and The Luna!&#34; Ura and Freya show up with a box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it&#39;s true! Good for you sweet sister hey Kayden!&#34; Ura shakes my hand with a little too much pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m actually really glad you&#39;re here! I just want to emphasize that I want to see my sister smiling every time I see her! Welcome to Karaya man!&#34; I see Freya glaring at me behind him with a face that basically says &#39;You heard him!&#39; How could I forget the rogue?! That was another stupid choice Kayden seriously? I go through all of these scenarios and I&#39;m already thinking of how I&#39;m going to advise my son. With his genetics he could actually outshine Hector himself! He was such a dutiful son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assure you Urayoán, I will work my ass off in that regard.&#34; THIS is the brother I KNOW I don&#39;t want angry at me. I know he&#39;s no match for me in a face to face fight, so does he... But from everything I have studied of him through Izz&#39;s mind he is the brother that they underestimate. However Izz would always trust him MOST when she was in the most dangerous missions... His power doesn&#39;t come from brute strength even though he&#39;s a powerful Gamma. In his silence he would watch everyone, because of his personality, he would take it in and considered everything that played out to better his particular gifts. When Izz came back from Avalon he found in her the kindred spirit he needed to practice his own strategies, and from what I keep looking in the bond, most HER VALUES are those HE taught her. And because they have so many shared experiences, have seen the worst and best in humanity together and at that moment would always consult and debate it, he has a VERY big influence on her... He is the silent lone predator who can stab your jugular before you catch his scent, a HUNTER in every sense of the word. They have dedicated years of studying the old ways of archery, and now I remember that in London he didn&#39;t carry a quiver! Both him and Izz carry their arrows on their draw hand! Artemis will definitely like him. I think on my relationship with my twin sister, my most beloved. Maybe if Artemis and her wouldn&#39;t have gotten along I most likely wouldn&#39;t have pursued her so much, but they and Medusa would hunt for days and then Artemis would tell me their adventures and it kept me intrigued. Knowing her, if I have a problem with her other brothers she&#39;ll most likely take my side. With Urayoán... She will want a VERY detailed explanation from both sides before she determines a side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I&#39;ll be expecting your face muscles to hurt soon Izzy!&#34; He says kissing her cheek and handing her the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo Ura what&#39;s in the box?&#34; Antoine asks, but Ura and Freya just smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Paco, give me a sec, apparently the presents just don&#39;t stop today!&#34; She looks excited and Ura reclines back and Freya lays her head on his chest taking a hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s wrapped in regular packing paper, but there&#39;s a stamp on the top, a she looks at him smiling. She just has too many memories with him to go through them, especially since I&#39;m still waking. But I can feel she feels already very happy! I&#39;m registering the stamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she opens it it&#39;s a beautifully crafted glass blown pineapple. Parts were yellow, however it did have many greens and blues that transition to almost turquoise for the crown of the pineapple. And then I notice it... It&#39;s not simply a glass blown pineapple, it&#39;s a bong!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa! Ura?! This is a Master Murano! How much did you spend on this are you crazy? You know what? I don&#39;t want to know I love you big brother! This is perfect let&#39;s break her in!&#34; And Nina goes to the little kitchen in the balcony and gets ice and wine while my beautiful Raven is wiping it with a silk rag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Izzy since we&#39;re just making a night out of it should we put some music on! You can&#39;t tell me that YOU of all people doesn&#39;t have a music system around! Yo Kayden man she is a huge fan of drums but we all know she adores strings! Yo Izzy remember when you TRIED to learn to play the chelo? What a disaster!&#34; Her eyes shoot daggers at Paco as see blushes deep! And I can&#39;t help but laugh and move her hair that is beautifully loose and kiss her long soft neck and linger at my mark making her melt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Buuu! Watch yourself control man this is The Circle this is the holiest of the holiest!&#34; Wow! NINA&#39;S giving me this! I look very deeply through the bond to make sure she has never done this in The Circle and to my fucking surprise she hasn&#39;t! Apparently this IS VERY SACRED to them!&#34; And I can&#39;t help but start laughing and drinking the beer oh boy! Is this what joining a cult feels like? I try to remember if we ever did join a cult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, ok, sorry! I&#39;m new Nina give me a break, do you forgive me? I will hold sacred your holy traditions!&#34; She gets beat red and looks at her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see how easy that was Papi! I didn&#39;t even have to use my screechy voice!! Congratulations Kayden you have past the first test!&#34; Test?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What fucking test are you talking about?&#34; Ura takes the bong and pours the wine and ice inside! Damn, that looks interesting, I feel my mates happiness at such a simple yet intimate moment with all of us. And now I understand that I didn&#39;t just get HER, I can&#39;t wait tomorrow to officially be in the link. They have perfected the art of living!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Kayden man, you&#39;re going to have to learn to tell Nina&#39;s bullshit she&#39;ll totally twist you! Even if you&#39;ve seen Izzy&#39;s memory you still haven&#39;t scratched the surface! That&#39;s an endless pit of despair right there!&#34; And I couldn&#39;t help but spit out my beer! Damn it! This is going to be more challenging than I thought because right at that moment Nina just gave me the glare of death from her eyes as if I had just taken a side! I feel like I&#39;m in Mount Olympus again! Okay what was this weed mix again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina calm your damn tits! Papi don&#39;t worry about her shit, there&#39;s never been any rules of that matter... However baby, we just chill here, you&#39;ll understand later. Ura, you know how to deal with the sound system Maco put in better than I do, put something.&#34; And dusk is filled with the sound of Redemption Song while we hit the bong. The ice and wine cooled the smoke so it didn&#39;t hit so hard in the throat and the wine really did something to the flavor, perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t remember the last time I heard that yet I notice that they have become a little more silent as the tune went on mixed with the buzz of the needle and the roar of the sea. I&#39;m still not in their Link, but through Izzy&#39;s Bond I feel what they all feel, and I really pay attention to the words... And I notice that this HITS HARD at them, but I also get their resignation of the past. They used to belong to the Taíno Empire, worshiped as gods and now they&#39;re relegated to just one Island. They were the ones who got the first hit of the European invaders and betrayed by the natives and almost died out. Yet after 500 hundred years they stand thriving, resiliency is too small a word for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina did you check out the measurements for the yard of the house?&#34; Izz asks solemnly, her voice weak. Nina woke like from a trance and Paco put down the needle to rub his eyes. He&#39;s almost done, but he needs a break and Ura patted his shoulder passing him the bong. Izz takes his hand and Nina wraps her arms around his shoulders and kisses his cheek, I notice that Antoine was smiling calmly at his mate with pride in his eyes... No anger or jealousy at all. And it clicks! It&#39;s fine to display affection in The Circle, but since they kinda use it as a sort of bonding therapy, it just would be somewhat inappropriate to be VERY intimate with your mate when the intimacy of The Circle is for ALL of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paco&#39;s mate died and from what I can see though her memories, this is his first Circle since what happened and with how in sync the pack is now they are giving him comfort. What happened this morning was an outburst of their collective pain... They are in harmony.</p>
