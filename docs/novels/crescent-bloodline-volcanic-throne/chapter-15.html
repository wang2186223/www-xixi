                <p>Aymaco&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I link Bayoán to see if they had already interrogated Yaya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;We haven&#39;t been able to start because she is  unconscious... and from the blood samples that Daniella was able to examine, she was drugged. She hooked her to an IV on her right now to flush out her system... she just woke up! So if you really want to see this I suggest you get your ass here now!&#39; Drugged? What the actual fuck is going on?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Where are you guys right now?&#39; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;We are in the medical ward at the pack house so just get over here.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked Jolene were exactly the medical word was and I follow her instructions on how to get there, Morgana, Bayo, Bruno and Braka are there. I reach out to my brother and we hug each other like as if we didn&#39;t see each other just yesterday at dinner before he went to his own home with Morgana, and then I pull her in the hug kissing her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; Bayo complains. &#34;Why don&#39;t I get a kiss too?&#34; He says chuckling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you be serious for once dude! How&#39;s my little niece or nephew doing? Is your shoulder better Morgana?&#34; A freaking captain of the military and even now he can&#39;t stop cracking stupid jokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, and my shoulder is still sore but it should be fine by tomorrow, how&#39;s Iza doing?&#34; The fire haired witch asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s under control, she is sleeping and Ura is with guarding her.&#34; I just want to get this interrogation over with immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guarding her? Why does she need a guard?&#34; Braka asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a long story, but General I suggest you put two guards at her door not allowing anyone in unless Ura allows it. I guess we&#39;ll have more information after this interrogation.&#34; Braka&#39;s expression becomes dark and I can tell he&#39;s linking soldiers protect my sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have sent Jorge and Susana, no one will get past them.&#34; It&#39;s true, if anyone gets past them it would have to be a whole pack and right now with the numbers I have in my head we already outnumber our host pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall we get started?&#34; Braka asks. Morgana takes a seat next to a still drowsy Yaya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yaya how are you feeling?&#34; Morgana asks her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like someone is hammering in my head, what are you guys talking about an interrogation what happened?! Where are we?&#34; Yaya asks. And Morgana nods at us, indicating that Yaya is genuinely confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the last thing you remember My Lady?&#34; Braka asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mark started itching and when I go outside to see if I can get any indication of what&#39;s going on, someone put the rag over my face and then I wake up here. What happened? Where are we?&#34; We look at Morgana, &#34;she speaks truth she does not remember anything, she does not know what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happened? WHAT HAPPENED?!&#34; She has started hyperventilating. &#34;Why can I feel so many people missing from the link? Where&#39;s the Alpha? Where is Desmond? Where is Dana?&#34; Morgana&#39;s eyes are fluttering like butterfly wings, she is registering Yaya&#39;s panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniella, can Yaya have a something to calm her?&#34; It&#39;s going to be hard for her to invoke her Light of Serenity in this state, and we can&#39;t give her answers. Priestesses are powerful but they feel everything and right now it must not help that she feels all of our anxiety and just waking from being drugged, she is overwhelmed. Daniella goes and gets something ready. Even I can feel Yaya&#39;s distress through the link. Daniella injects what I can only imagine to be a sedative into her IV. And Yaya breathing starts to steady, it&#39;s then her Mark shine yellow. I look for Desmond and Dana, Yaya&#39;s children through the link, it&#39;s faint, but they are there, I suspect they are in the boats. Yaya never found her mate but she married Cayetano who was killed in the line of duty a few years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yaya, I felt both of them, but they are fine. Do you have any idea, any recollection of any one of who drugged you?&#34; She pauses thinking on what I just said. And she starts pounding her head with her hand. Bayo reaches her and stops her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Focus Yaya, use your intuition!&#34; Morgana reminds her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly Yaya&#39;s Marks starts glowing yellow again, she closes her eyes and the Mark is very bright engulfing the whole room with its yellow light. She takes a deep breath and opens her eyes. &#34;Can someone tell me what happened now? I&#39;m a priestess not a telepath.&#34; Morgana looks at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guys she really doesn&#39;t know we need to know how she got on the plane.&#34; Shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; Yaya says suddenly. I can see her trying to remember something. &#34;Where is Urayoán?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Braka asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has the sharpest nose on the island, I remember that when whomever put the rag over my face I felt pressure on my back and arm, so whomever drugged me must have left his or her scent plus they must have carried me. I&#39;m sure Urayoán will be able to get a lead.&#34; I can see her still trying to remember more, but she&#39;s on to something. I link Ura to get over here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayo, go to Izzy&#39;s room and stay with her until Ura returns, that is the only way to get him in here, I told them about the guards but you know how he is.&#34; I tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it, tell him I&#39;m on my way.&#34; As he leaves the room I link Ura. 5 minutes latter Ura gets here and we fill him in on what&#39;s happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that the clothes you had on Yaya?&#34; Ura asks her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Yaya responds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can someone get her another shirt? Daniella has her bag with her and hands her a t-shirt. Yaya takes off the one she has and hands it to Ura before putting the one Daniella gave her. Nudity is not a big deal for us and as a Priestess she cares even less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ura puts on surgical gloves before taking her shirt, the scent must be contaminated enough already having been over three hours inside an airplane. But here Ura is in his element. He sprays saline water inside his nose as to rinse it from other scents, he goes to the sink and blows his nose. He is preparing it to receive and study every single scent on that shirt. He gets a ziplock bag out of his own bag and puts Yaya&#39;s shirt inside of it and then he zips it up. He then opens it and puts his nose inside the bag, he always does this to avoid the scents from everyone who is surrounding him. He closes his eyes and I can tell that he is in deep study of it. He opens his eyes suddenly!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are of course a lot of scents on this shirt, but one sticks out like a sore thumb after your own Yaya it is the strongest. He closes his eyes and puts his nose inside the bag again, he usually does this to make sure to just focus on that particular scent, he takes deep breaths. He looks at General Braka and asks where is Elder Joel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone that was in Yaya&#39;s plane is in holding except for the pups and the Luna.&#34; Ura locks the bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I strongly suggest you question Elder Joel, besides Yaya&#39;s scent, his is the strongest.&#34; I see Braka link someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are bringing him now.&#34; Yaya turns to Ura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urayoán how is Iza, I can barely feel her?&#34; A tear fell from her eye and her eyes are glazing and her Mark shines yellow again, she is trying to keep it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is fine Yaya but she is in hibernation for now. We will tell you everything but you need to maintain serenity.&#34; Yaya is a veteran Priestess, and besides her original shock from waking up she is slowly composing herself, and I am glad she isn&#39;t the traitor, and if Izzy is lucky she will be fully cleared by Braka and hand command of the pack to her.</p>
