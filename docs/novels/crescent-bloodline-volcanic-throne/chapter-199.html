                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would make sense that the previous packs and supernatural beings that inhabited these islands know of your collaboration with Selene for the warewolves, it would confirm many things in Gaia&#39;s Grimoire.&#34; Ever since Phoebe asked why there was a symbol for the Sun instead of the Moon on The Guanín when she first inspected it the thought stayed on the back of my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It makes sense especially considering what these islands were once. The Osupa must have retained this information subconsciously, as much as I look in your memory I can&#39;t find it.&#34; I can&#39;t remember it from this lifetime either. After we came back to our room and made love we started brainstorming in the bath tub while I scrubbed his back with a natural loofah enjoying the beautiful bulges and crevices of the god in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We didn&#39;t even get this information in Avalon either... But... This information used to be available, what do you think happened that they chugged you out of warewolf history?&#34; He grabbed my wrists gently and brought me in front of him and he kissed me deeply, I can live this moment over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Uncle and my Father happened... When we decided to take the warewolves as our vessels, Selene had all that information removed. It would serve as a bread crumb trail... It&#39;s fine Izz, my godly ego is not what it was, I don&#39;t need to be included in every history page as long as you are safe and we&#39;re together.&#34; He picked me up and sat me on his lap burrowing himself in my arms, his face in my bossom as he breathed in my scent and that of the pups and he lingered there while I started trying to untangle his unruly curls. I still remember when he would leave them to grow long and I would braid them in the old Greek archaic period style. Yet I can feel how he&#39;s trying not to think and just rest his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your thoughts are far away My Lord.&#34; I casually mention as I keep untangling his golden locks. He breathed deep taking in as much of our scent as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got a note from Persephone that she handed to Moira.&#34; I lift his chin so he can tell me it&#39;s content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And?&#34; He smiles at me and kissed my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cymmy is with Selene. She will move up your next Heat for the next full moon, she, Hera and Artemis concluded that we shouldn&#39;t take shots in the dark and coordinate it as well as possible and I agree. Izz this is Cymmy we&#39;re talking about, I don&#39;t want to risk her conception.&#34; Hera might despise Apollo, Artemis and Phoebe, but she was more of a mother to me than Doris. My relationship with my original mother and father is just as bad as Kayden&#39;s with his own father, however his relationship with Zeus started very well. Zeus trusted and delegated many important responsibilities upon Apollo, it was usually Ares he despised and distrusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However what happened to Prometheus never sat well with my Sun God. His only rebellious act towards Zeus rendered him into a mortal human slave to a human king for a year. In the end his half brother Hercules had the pleasure of releasing Prometheus... After this the trust between Apollo and Zeus was strained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree as well. I&#39;ll inform Moira to give Bayoán and the others some bullshit story so it doesn&#39;t become a precedent, having the information of the other female Alphas&#39; pregnancies was very useful, I don&#39;t want any confusion for future females who would rule.&#34; He nods. I&#39;ll only have less than a month to get used to the Alpha training full on without restraint, I can already hear Kayden and the Betas giving me shit if I go all out while pregnant and I hate having to hold back! Ugh! I could always spar with...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear woman, stop! Your over excitement over this training is making me more nervous! From what Antoine says it&#39;s brutal! Sure have all the fun you want but darling once Cymmy is inside you I&#39;LL spar with you, but WE WILL be chill about it! This would be a good time to focus on Prime Priestess meditation and training. Please babe...&#34; Ugh! I can&#39;t help giving in when he&#39;s pleading so sweetly!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, but make sure you have the forms correctly and you have to stretch more. I know you&#39;ve been doing it, but it&#39;s imperative for this training my Love. Remember, the combat training I received is specifically for Gamma&#39;s but Mami wouldn&#39;t hold back with us except for Nina and even with Nía she was pretty harsh. So tap into my training with my mother and you&#39;ll have a clearer picture of what you&#39;ll be facing. It shouldn&#39;t  be a problem for you but your Kayden persona still carries doubts, you have to sync more with Deacon.&#34; If we indeed make a deal to finally end Poseidon I want us to be as prepared as possible. He caught that though and held me tighter and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>_____________</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I hope this overdue Council meeting will be held in a civilized fashion this time and hopefully you&#39;re all better prepared.&#34; I sit down and everyone who was last time was present except for Bayo who&#39;s on Leave, and the addition of the Alphas and Betas of packs that handed in their pack&#39;s assets. They sat in unison after me, so far so good. Yengiga and Palu didn&#39;t know and wanted to hand over what they had, it wasn&#39;t much compared to the other assets, so we agreed that it would be best that it be divided among themselves so that they have some startup founds. The pack is wealthy enough especially now, it&#39;s way better for the economy if they have the founds to invest locally, either way both of them and Hiroto and Haya have experience administrating a pack so the others can pick and choose who they want to work with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Cacique, we are better prepared this time and we ask you excuse past behavior, it was indeed unbecoming.&#34; I smile at Braka with a face of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you General. We have a few items that we didn&#39;t address last time, please let&#39;s start there. Lord Orwell, I have read the report of the blood clan that wishes to join our people, can you please explain to those here the circumstances?&#34; This has me and Yaya very excited! The Priestess of this clan is Ziggy and she has already asked for a full transfer if they are welcomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you my Queen, besides a few more vampires who wish to join individually there are a few blood clans that are interested, however I personally don&#39;t trust them with the exception of Gau Sakratua Odol Klana from the Basque Country. Aurelia and myself have known Chieftain Aitor Olaberría for over half a century, Lutherus for even longer and I am aware that their Priestess Ziggy Arista is known and trusted by The Osupa. Their numbers are about 350, usually blood clans don&#39;t have as large numbers as warewolf packs but their Warriors are dedicated.&#34; Indeed blood clans never reach high numbers, vampires don&#39;t share a hive mind or grand kingdoms like the elves and fae, this along with their long life spans makes them have more individualistic values rather than a collective mind like us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that most were human before is a big factor in what makes them have the least trustworthy reputation in the supernatural world. However this is Ziggy&#39;s people and we are trying to do away with past prejudice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for your report My Lord, I share your concern about taking in whole blood clans, I hope you don&#39;t take offense. Indeed the Lady Ziggy has been friend to The Osupa for over a century, however I have never met their chieftain. Before we make any move forward I would like to chat directly with my old Master and with the Lady Yaya. Besides catching up I would like to hear directly what she and her clan propose. Has anybody else had the opportunity to read the report? I would like to hear what you all have to say with regards to this matter.&#34; The Mark on my forehead is soothing me but it is giving me a warning to not allow one particular vampire, apparently a mole from The Council. I look at Kayden, he gives a very subtle nod and guides my eyes towards Gloria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director I imagine you&#39;ve had the chance to make inquiries?&#34; She takes a breath and tucks some hair behind her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you know Cacique, Everett has a contact inside The Council, we have been able to make contact with him and he wishes to remain in the inside, however his mate and daughter were in London during the attack but not in the Warewolf Council building. His ID and information are in the report that I handed in.&#34; Yes, Robert Paige from Moon Shadow pack, Oregon. He hid the fact that his mate is a True Mate when he discovered his mother was used against his father to extract information during The Great War, his pack is led by his older brother Alpha Domenic who specifically put Robert in the inside since they had to submit after The War.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I have read the plight of his pack, I&#39;m sorry that not everyone has received this report, not everyone here are council members so please excuse that this Top Secret information can&#39;t be shared with you at this time. Director I am giving you a warning not to disclose confidential information on an individual who is an acting informant.&#34; For REAL! Why is she bringing this HERE NOW?! I look at Tía and she&#39;s closing Gloria&#39;s report that the Director had left open and Gloria slightly blushes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayo did in fact tell me that many meetings of the Council were indeed chaotic, and Dad and Guillermo were trying to guide Yadiel and Bayoán to keep a more disciplined gathering. Fuck that! This will be done correctly or not at all!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I beg your pardon Cacique, I will definitely keep the information of the informant confidential. As you can all infer by his assistance, him and his pack are no fans of The Council, he has his mate and pup hidden but since The Warewolf Council thinks they&#39;re dead he wishes to keep that knowledge a secret and if he sends them to his pack, well... He will be giving them his family&#39;s location. He knows of a vampire who will be sent by The Council as a mole, if we take his family in and the weakest of his pack he will tell us who it is and stay as mole as he&#39;s been until now. The moment we found out his identity we fully researched him and have operatives in the</p>
