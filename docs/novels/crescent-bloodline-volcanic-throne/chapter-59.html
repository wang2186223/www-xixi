                <p>Bayoán&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me 7 fucking heads could&#39;ve meant Kayden going crazy?! Just because I don&#39;t particularly like the guy doesn&#39;t mean I want to hurt him or my sister! He could have killed the best shot our people have for a stable future and Izzy is right he held on to his control!&#34; Damn, I have been harsh on the guy but he has shown nothing but love and devotion for Izzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you feel bad for him? Will you get cold feet for tonight? He is still not trustworthy! Or have you forgotten? He is an Alpha Bayoán, they&#39;re more powerful than you know.&#34; This is bullshit, his mother is the one I really don&#39;t trust, he may just be a bystander. I&#39;m now thinking how I would have felt if THIS was Morgana&#39;s welcome to our family and I feel myself getting angry at a hypothetical situation, and I must admit, Izzy has been very patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What cold feet for tonight?! The guy is still recovering from taking in all that poison and having it expunged! He might not even be able to perform!&#34; I had almost forgotten what a cold hearted bitch Moira can be sometimes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s an Alpha! He will be more that able to perform. He is keeping good control, but when Loiza&#39;s presented to him on a platter, especially with her Heat, he will definitely be able to perform. He has had all day to recover... Loiza&#39;s control is what concerns me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you should concern yourself with more important matters than my sex life Moira!&#34; Great timing...I pinch the bridge of my nose ready for what&#39;s coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy, I&#39;m really sorry... I didn&#39;t know...&#34; I really have no clue how to apologize for this not just to my sister, but my Alpha and Cacique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And yet it was YOU who requested The fucking Sword of Peace! Don&#39;t make requests if you are not 100% sure of it&#39;s consequences... Do I make myself clear?&#34; FUCK!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Alpha.&#34; What has gotten into me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR BETA?!&#34; Holy shit, she IS pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crystal clear Cacique, I will go back to father&#39;s books and double check everything, I SWEAR TO YOU sister, I will not fail you again.&#34; I can feel her rage through her aura, which has become more powerful since last I saw her only a few hours ago. And Moira sees it...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza, where did you get that Mark?&#34; Izzy gives her a look full of the utmost contempt and ignores her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes dearest brother, you go and study father&#39;s books... let&#39;s start with THIS one!&#34; And she throws father&#39;s gibberish book (at least that&#39;s what we have always called it) on the table. &#34;WHY did he keep this book and made us study a &#39;gibberish book&#39;? Where did he get it?&#34; She is dead serious on this book. And I have never understood it myself and Moira takes it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know this book My Lady?&#34; I can already tell Izzy already has some insight into it and is related to that new Mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I have never seen this language before... your father had this? Did he say what it means?&#34; She is examining it in different angles, her usual stone cold face visibly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you can&#39;t read it either?&#34; Izzy asks Moira with a bored voice still looking at me with looks to kill. &#39;Izzy, how many times do you want me to say I&#39;m sorry? I&#39;ll do it.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You WILL go to Kayden when we are done here and you will apologize to HIM, THEN I will accept your apology, do you understand?&#39; Damn it! I would rather have a fight with Nina. &#39;FINE! I&#39;ll apologize to your mate, happy now?&#39; Great, if I didn&#39;t have enough on my plate I have to apologize to Alpha Kayden. &#39;I will be when I confirm you DID.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Loiza, I can&#39;t read this book, can you?&#34; And Izzy finally looks at her and gives her a pleasant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks to my new gift I can read more than just this book...&#34; She says pointing at her new Mark. Moira goes to her to examine the Mark...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks like it&#39;s made in the same way the Mark of Avalon is created.&#34; And goes to touch it yet she jerks her hand away as if it burned her. &#34;Yet it&#39;s not of Avalon!&#34; And she is looking at her now burned finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy, how did you get that Mark?&#34; If it&#39;s not of Avalon, what is it? And she just looks at me. &#34;ALPHA?!&#34; And she blinks like she was somewhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father TOLD you where he got this book! Why can&#39;t you remember?&#34; He did?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What in Hades are you talking about? I don&#39;t remember Dad ever saying where he got this book or WHY he expected us to read it. He couldn&#39;t even read it himself!&#34; It was like with the old car, it was one of his &#39;tests&#39; only no one passed this one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So neither of you has any answers regarding this book?&#34; And I don&#39;t think she expects an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got this Mark by the touch of a woman in The Fort&#39;s Catacombs.&#34; She just says it like nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A woman? In the Catacombs?&#34; She rolls her eyes at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you describe her? A mere woman can&#39;t give you a Mark.&#34; Moira asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looked... Like me, I think? I remember she had black hair, her eyes were all white and she had a green glow about her.&#34; Izzy sits looking like she is trying to remember more, but failing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Green? Green is the color of The Goddess Gaia... If it&#39;s of the teachings of Gaia it should be in a scroll... That or someone paid a very hefty amount of gold to have have this transcribed into a grimoire. And looking at you with that in mind, Gaia DOES have long black hair and your features could be considered similar... Did she say anything?&#34; Well, when The Grand Prime Priestess of Avalon is stumped on devine information and was told to fuck herself on the same day? It&#39;s a special day indeed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She only said &#39;You are the ones who will make us whole again.&#39; When I asked her by what name should I call her she just appeared and touched me where the Mark is and then she was gone. But I had the book and when she gave me the Mark I was able to read it... More specifically I have it memorized. I also have been getting visions like she is trying to guide me.&#34; She looks confused herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, Izzy, why were you in The Catacombs with the book to begin with?&#34; And she gives me an alarmed look. She takes out her phone and puts it to record on the desk...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am recording because I am noticing a pattern of forgetfulness... I was studying my father&#39;s books to learn to be a better leader, and I stumbled upon what we call the gibberish book. The moment I touched it it brought back a very vague memory from before I went to Avalon. Natalia, Yadiel and myself have always been fascinated by The Catacombs. However we were never allowed inside. One day it starting calling with a much stronger voice but Natalia was not there, at least I do not remember her being there, I remember Suania... I think? and Yadiel wanting to join me going down there. Yadiel and I were calm and felt safe, but Suania got scared and ran back, Yadiel and I found symbols in the book etched on the walls of The Catacombs but we were whisked away by grownups... That&#39;s all I remember.&#34; And she ends the recording.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you seriously forgetting stuff that you have to record yourself?!&#34; Maybe that Mark is jumbling her brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First of all it&#39;s a memory from BEFORE I was FIVE! Second, look in a mirror buddy you&#39;re forgetting shit too! Dad DID tell you where he got this book, I see it in YOUR memory but because YOU don&#39;t remember it&#39;s imposible for me to read. So focus your mind and memories, I have a feeling this particular information is being purposely hidden from us... And if The Lady Moira is right and this IS connected to the Goddess Gaia... Well, just pay attention! She is the ancestral mother of all life, mother of Titans and Gods! If she has something to say, you can be damn sure that I will listen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moira started looking at her burned finger again... &#34;Loiza, can Bayoán touch your new Mark?&#34; I look at Izzy and she shrugs. &#34;Sure, why?&#34; Moira signals me to go on... Damn it, I hate getting burned, didn&#39;t I suffer enough with this stupid B on my wrist? &#34;I will know in a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;FINE!&#34; I reach out and touch Izzy&#39;s Mark, and I am in The Catacombs! I look around and I see the symbols, I take a torch to study a particular one...a circle with a cross connecting the circumference of the circle and I am back in the tent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoa! &#34;I was there! I was in the Catacombs!&#34; I take a piece of paper and draw the symbol I saw. I pass it to Moira...&#34;This, I saw this symbol, do you know what it means?&#34; Both her and Izzy look at it, and at the same time say &#34;EARTH!&#34; And Izzy opens the book and inside she scribbles it in a note pad: &#34;Do you remember where in the Catacombs you saw it?&#34; Well I&#39;ll be damned...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayo?&#34; And I am a blank! &#34;I have no clue! What the hell?! I was JUST there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see what I mean?!&#34; She IS right!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza has anyone else touched the Mark?&#34; She is thinking... she can memorize a book but simple things like that are tricky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... no, I am sure, Ayana asked about it and Nina and Cresta saw it, but none touched it.&#34; Moira takes out her seldom used phone and takes pictures of the writing in the book and Izzy&#39;s Mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll ask around, Loiza I know it&#39;s annoying but allow others to touch it, especially your family and your mate. It might not want me to see but it allowed your brother to peer into it. It might be receptive to family and not to outsiders, it might have let Bayoán touch it as he is your Beta... Also let Cresta and Ayana touch it. Remember we are Priestesses of Selene, there might be turmoil among the Gods and having the head Priestess of another might not be &#39;invited&#39;. The Gods are as fickle as humans... yet you&#39;re a Priestess of Selene... I have never seen something like it. But you are right, Gaia is mother to us all, so if it is indeed her we MUST be alert, however Loiza keep your eyes open, especially for this symbol.&#34; And she points to the one I made. &#34;I might start recording myself too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well the Moon will rise soon, and I have a date.&#34; She turns to Moira. &#34;Are the others ready to give me backup My Lady?&#34; Moira nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are just to serve as backup for your self control for when you Mark your mate no more, it&#39;s the best we can do to also protect your privacy, ok?&#34; Izzy nods, now looking a little nervous. &#34;Loiza... for what it&#39;s worth, I am sorry. Come what may, I will make it up to him, I swear it.&#34; Loiza just looks at her with mild anger now... it&#39;s an improvement. She turns to me: &#34;Be alert for my signal if I... Find anything.&#34; I hate that this is how she goes into her mating ceremony... But it shows her steel, and I feel a little guilty thinking that Yadiel wouldn&#39;t have been half the Alpha she is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you command Cacique.&#34; Her eyes are glazed, she nods as she leaves the tent.</p>
