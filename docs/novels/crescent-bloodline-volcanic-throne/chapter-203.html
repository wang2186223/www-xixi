                <p>Robert&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the deal the Cacique proposed, they already have an operative waiting for the ok to have a portal ready to bring Marla and Rachel after being questioned by a Truth Seer and they will be tattooed with a protection symbol we all wear. They are to be her personal guests, but they don&#39;t think it wise to move larger numbers from Oregon. If they go along with that it could raise suspicion to your pack, however if the pack is in imminent danger they will definitely consider moving everyone. If that&#39;s the case then they would make a treaty with Moon Shadow and grant sanctuary. Robert, they have the means of getting the information about the mole The Council wishes to plant without your help, but if you give it to them now it will be easier to appeal for any assistance. Either way your mate and daughter are welcomed whichever your choice is.&#34; Damn! Dominic and I were hoping to get my sister and nieces and nephews out as well as some orphaned pups but I see their logic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic is very interested in an alliance with The Osupa to fully crush The Council.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everett do you think she&#39;ll at least take in Juliette and her boys? I&#39;ll give her the name but Dominic and myself will feel better if we are sure that they&#39;re safe. I understand their logic and it would be suspicious if our Luna and my niece were to leave Moon Shadow, but Juliette and the boys are not even acknowledged by The Council.&#34; She&#39;s already been through enough when her mate Sawyer was killed by rogues last winter she was devastated. I can hear he&#39;s asking someone about my request but it&#39;s so muffled I can&#39;t make it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beta Paige, do you copy?&#34; A female voice asks through the comm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loud and clear, who am I speaking with?&#34; I&#39;ve only communicated with Everett, but I already know how careful The Osupa are with their security. It took that idiot Armand decades to attack them and still it was short lived and lost everything because of it. They&#39;re operatives in London already knew who my family was and one evacuated them while the others were preparing the bombs, they&#39;re in a safehouse but I don&#39;t feel comfortable with them staying in England at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the Director of our intelligence agency Beta, please excuse the circumstances of meeting this way. Know that your request for your sister and nephews has been linked to the Cacique and she&#39;s discussing it with the Betas at this moment, so please bear with us. Yet know that if she allows for them to come they too must follow the same protocols, understood?&#34; Betas? Plural? They definitely aren&#39;t messing around with their security...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand Director but I can&#39;t be online for much longer, will it take long?&#34; I will give them William even if they just take Marla and Rachel but if I can secure Julie and the boys I&#39;ll take my shot! It will definitely help me focus better around these idiots and Dominic will have one less thing to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are aware of your circumstances Beta and we are at this moment adding an extra layer of security to the line. We already have a portal ready to be opened to the safehouse where your mate and pup are and a Truth Seer and Tattoo Master to get them over here ASAP.&#34; What&#39;s with this tattoo thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Director, what&#39;s the tattoo for?&#34; Everett had mentioned it before but didn&#39;t say the reason for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you can imagine Beta as much security as we have implemented there are numerous forms of attack. Two of our members have been possessed by a particular deamon, fortunately we have knowledge on how to become invisible to them with a particular symbol that repels any and all entities. That&#39;s why everyone in the island is marked with it, it doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s size as long as it&#39;s made to perfection. I hope you understand.&#34; Possessions?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And it protects from ALL entities?&#34; We did get a report from Mortiana that her cousin Morgana was mated to a wolf in the island.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, so far it&#39;s protection has not failed us--- hold a moment Beta.&#34; I have to inform Marla and Domenic about this. If it&#39;s protection is this strong Domenic should consider it. &#34;Beta, the Cacique has allowed for your sister and nephews to come but no more, is that acceptable?&#34; Praise the Goddess&#39;s Mercy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! I will inform my brother of your decision so he can inform our sister to be ready. I&#39;ll send you the coordinates of our pack--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need Beta, we already have agents in the vicinity awaiting orders. But inform your Alpha about the process so there&#39;s no misunderstandings, both extractions are to be as fast as possible to avoid any detection but be assured we have eyes on all of you. The second you give us the name of the vampire we will move at once.&#34; I text Dominic on the throw away phone what The Osupa are willing to provide sanctuary to Julie. And after a few minutes he answers to move forward and that Julie is packing up!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director, my brother has accepted the conditions. The vampire who will try to infiltrate is called William Roy.&#34; I proceed to give a detailed description but they already know who he is!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for your cooperation and patience Beta Paige, we know that you&#39;re worried about your family but know that we will still have eyes on Moon Shadow in case they need immediate assistance should anything go wrong. So please inform that to your Alpha and in case of an emergency one of our agents will give him a particular flair gun to only use in the event he is under any attack and your pack can&#39;t handle it, ok?&#34; These people have a backup plan to their backup plans! And these morons still think they have any chance at all!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Director, thank you and thank Alpha Loiza for her mercy.&#34; She took revenge on The Council better than Dominic and I could ever have dreamed off!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She personally thanks you for your assistance Beta, but know that we have agents in the</p>
