                <p>&#34;How much do you remember Grandmother?&#34; After returning from Hacienda Lobo Azul, Nina went with her team to check the conditions at Hacienda Florencia. Izz and I are trying to figure out where Grandmother is in her awakening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember who and what I am. I know who both of you are. I know that Gaia has a plan and you two struck a deal so she gets what she wants.&#34; A deal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Master, do you know what deal we made exactly?! What did we ask for and what was the price?! Do you remember what happened last lifetime?&#34; I have a feeling that I was the one who asked for us not to be Twin Souls this lifetime... Shit! She already knows about Jade. If we aren&#39;t Twin Souls she can&#39;t know everything inside my head and she hates when I lie or keep something from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phi remember not to call me Master, I chose to keep my original name to avoid those slip ups! Either way, I&#39;m still putting pieces together, I don&#39;t remember what happened past lifetime, but my I do remember that my past body could have easily lived for another 500 years... And yet something did happen that I&#39;m here in this body. I guess it must have been very bad.&#34; Her yellow eyes are looking for answers. I&#39;m not liking all these loose ends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe, do you remember what&#39;s your standing with..?&#34; And I pass her a paper with the name Hera. She&#39;s in deep though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only have fond memories when I think about her... But I don&#39;t think I have seen her in a few lifetimes. Guys I really want to see Artemis and visit with Medusa, maybe we can get some more insight from Hades besides getting our stuff.&#34; I agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hades, uncle, King of the Underworld and Lands of the Dead, welcome us to your realm!&#34; I say out loud hopefully he can give us some clues, he has to respect the contract as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We suddenly feel the darkness engulfing us and we are at the shores of The River Styx and we see the Broad Bottom Packet ferried by Charon. He usually will ask for payment but he knows better than to be a nuisance. He ferries us to the gates, Cerberus gives a courtly bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the Throne Room he sits waiting with his vicious smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it was about time you all woke up! Persephone is on her way... Summer... You know.&#34; Indeed, Demeter needs to hang out with her &#39;little girl&#39;. He comes over and embraces Phi looking her up and down and then me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well so far you&#39;re both looking ok... Phoebe why are you starting a new life cycle?!&#34; What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know?!&#34; I asked him shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hades are you serious?! You don&#39;t know?!&#34; Grandmother asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of you told me to keep out of the negotiating this time! Artemis was there but you know she won&#39;t betray your secrets. Nephew, all you told me was that my fish tank for Poseidon would be inhabited soon.&#34; Now he&#39;s in deep though. Shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And here we thought we could get answers from you... But still, you say that Apollo promised to fill your tank?&#34; Phi looks at me, but I don&#39;t remember!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me guess, neither of you are fully awake? This is strange... Is Gaia giving you a mission? Maybe that&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t invited...&#34; Persephone arrived in her black carriage with Artemis and... Ares?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s about time you awakened!&#34; Artemis jumps off and jumps me... As usual. She wraps her arms around my neck and I&#39;m suddenly feeling like I can&#39;t breathe!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Artemis! You&#39;re killing my man!&#34; Phi points to my face turning blue... Artemis forgets that she is a Goddess and I&#39;m just a mortal. And she gives me a sheepish look loosening her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry brother! Shit! I hate this! I miss you guys!&#34; She lets me go and pushed Persephone who was embracing Phi and gave her a squeeze!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss you both so much! Uncle, isn&#39;t there anyway that they can come back if they do kill that asshole?!&#34; Phi is inhaling Artemis&#39;s golden curls and hugging her back for dear life. I used to always love this sight!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. They made their choice. It would require the power of Zeus and I doubt your father will be that magnanimous.&#34; He gives Phi a bittersweet smile as Persephone goes to his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I want to know is what are you doing here?&#34; Grandmother asks Ares as he came to give me a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HEY! I&#39;m helping!&#34; He answered outraged. Helping?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why and how are you helping exactly? Are you having a little lover&#39;s quarrel with Aphrodite again?&#34; Phi and I look over at him. He closes his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phoebe can you please not name her? It&#39;s been more than 400 years since I&#39;ve heard that cursed name!&#34; He gives Phi a kiss on her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were always smarter than me brother, if I would have been smarter I would have definitely tried harder to pursue Amphitrite instead of leaving you have her!&#34; Uff, what happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As if! Sorry big guy, you had ZERO chance! What did she do THIS time? If what you say is true then this would be the longest you two have been apart.&#34; Phi always would put him in his place, yet she loves him very much and goes to him raking her fingers through his hair. He just hugged her waist and started weeping. This is not normal. I go to them and Phi is giving me this worried look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not lying, Ares what happened?&#34; Grandmother is looking concerned as well. He&#39;s starting to regain some composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Artemis, what happened?!&#34; She gives him a gloomy look. And sits next to him putting her arm around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eros wanted his father to know what REAL love was like... He fell for a human and was going to renounce his immortality to be with her when she was about to give birth. Aphrodite was furious and sent her to The Third Realm...&#34; Persephone explained. Fucking bitch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT?! Oh sweetie, how long did it take you to find her?&#34; Phi asked looking at me with sadness in her eyes. In The Third Realm time works different from this one... It&#39;s like Avalon, which is in The Fifth Realm, but instead of not having to worry about time, in The Third Realm time moves forward VERY fast!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An hour! A fucking HOUR! I gave that cunt EVERYTHING of me for AGES and never once did she show that I was of any importance to her! Tamara gave me more in a decade than that bitch ever did and I fucking FAILED her! She was almost decayed by the time I found her and it was because Uncle felt when The Fates cut her string.&#34; Uncle embraced Persephone harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Olympus is a bloody mess nephew, it has been for quite some time. The time of the gods of Olympus is almost at an end. Your father has no more worshippers... Frankly I have my Realm intact because of the nature of it... It&#39;s not like mortals will stop dying. Ares and Athena still stay strong because war will probably always be worshipped. Dionysus is always doing pretty well too, but Zeus? His power dwindles by the day. And Poseidon also grows weak! Don&#39;t tell me because I don&#39;t want to screw you guys over with Gaia, but the contamination the humans are producing is indeed weakening both Poseidon and Gaia. I can only come to my own conclusion that Gaia is more than willing to get rid of Poseidon, who doesn&#39;t do anything to protect his domain... I can only deduce that she may want Triton to rule.&#34; He&#39;s now in deep though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does... He know about Triton?&#34; Phi asks now in my arms afraid of the answer. I look at Hades but he comes and strokes her cheek softly with the back of his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No my darling girl, Persephone&#39;s spell is holding strong!&#34; What was the spell? He can of course read me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Love they need the explanation again!&#34; She gives a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine! My darlings, I took away your scent Apollo. I can&#39;t give him Poseidon&#39;s scent because he&#39;s not his father, but I was able to take yours out of the equation Apollo. The spell can only be broken if I die, or the second Poseidon dies. That way the oceans continue to be guarded and there&#39;s a continuous hierarchy so that chaos doesn&#39;t take over.&#34; Phi facepalms herself remembering Pasha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! You stop that right now young lady! Selene had Pasha&#39;s consent to take your place! You are all only partially awake and it will take years before you fully remember everything, but before each reincarnation we are all given a choice for who we want to be. Pasha was made aware of your situation and wanted the freedom of the ocean, she was more than happy to take your place Amphitrite child! It&#39;s a good thing that you both are bonding.&#34; Persephone always knows how to give her a pep talk!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does she know? Is she aware of it?&#34; My beautiful Neriad always needs to double check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not! Mortals only remember their past lives when they die. Now can you please relax?! Phi, it&#39;s fine! And now more so since she basically is under your protection, but still she&#39;s also protected by Triton! You both have a wonderful boy as a son. However he already knows your location my dear, he has been tempted to see you, but both Gaia and Selene have advised against it. A little visit could mean HIM finding you both.&#34; I hold Her thightly. I can scent her distress... I coo her to relax her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phi, Triton is strong. We will see him again Love, ok? Don&#39;t worry.&#34; Artemis has her arms around Ares, he&#39;s still not looking well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phi seriously, Ares, Dionysus and myself check on all of them! They are well. Rhodes is safe with Helios and Cymopolea was asking about being mortal and joining both of you. She&#39;s been miserable for almost a thousand years now... I told her that I would ask you the minute I saw you next. Hera has her stashed away like she did with you and went to negotiate with Gaia but neither of you had been reborn yet.&#34; I feel her fury and a few of her tears fall on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cymmy was a wonderful daughter but Father insisted on giving her to his buddy Briareus and Phi had no say in the matter, especially after Poseidon agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew that twisted asshole would be terrible for my little girl! I can speak with Hera myself! If she would give up her immortality I would be ecstatic about having her in my arms again!&#34; I look at my sister with a pleading look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We would have her immediately sister! When did you get so buddy, buddy with Hera?&#34; She scoffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we&#39;re tight as thieves! What&#39;s wrong with that mortal brain of yours brother?! After getting called EVERY name in the book and only because Cymmy asked for me was that I was permitted to see her! You can imagine how our darling step mommy welcomed me. Anyway, neither of you is to go near Hera, she&#39;s actually putting her neck on the line and it&#39;s only because it&#39;s Amphitrite&#39;s daughter. Her powers are getting weaker as well, and we can only transport her HERE if you agreed to her rebirth.&#34; My darling girl!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well tell her we agree ASAP! Uncle can she come now?&#34; He looks at Persephone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to negotiate with Gaia, but she had already showed that she would be fine with it and Cymmy is of water... It could work! I&#39;ll ask Gaia for an audience. Once we reach an agreement we will send word with Moira. I&#39;ll go at once! Who knows how long she&#39;ll leave me waiting, you know how she is. When is your next Heat Phi? We&#39;re going to have to measure this carefully.&#34; Izzy&#39;s now calculating and she looks at me. She&#39;s not sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not sure Artemis, everything in this lifetime has been bizarre! The woman I was born to was a psychotic cunt! You have no idea how much I miss Mother.&#34; Phi wrapped her arms around my chest, I couldn&#39;t help kiss her head and caress her soft hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her powers were already becoming weak last time I saw her alive, Artemis was with her when she returned to Delos were she finally turned into one of her beloved wolves and joined a pack that was protected by Artemis. She eventually died as a common she wolf. Grandmother was devastated, however she&#39;s in Selene&#39;s Realm peacefully...</p>
