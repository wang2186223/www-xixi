                <p>Avis&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack is excited, Adam can&#39;t stop yapping about wanting to learn to be Double O Dummy. He was driving me nuts until Leo started chiming in and they just went on a rampage of stupidity, I just kept looking at her. Joey, Jason and his mate came with us to ensure that everything went smoothly. I have to hand it to The Osupa, they definitely have a knack for survival and endurance. When the guys came back from London and she wasn&#39;t with them I almost went berserk, she&#39;s not my mate, but there&#39;s something about her scent... It drew me to her since she came to our pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the fuck is Josephine?!&#34; I asked them and Leo, who I know was eyeing her making me furious, casually responds with:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo man! Joey is one of THEM! She&#39;s an OSUPA SPY! The Luna sent her to check on us and help get us stronger!&#34; What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Avis look in the link man, check out the shit that they can do in HUMAN form!&#34; Adam was sold on the idea of joining up THAT day. But I was focused on her, how she even changed the pitch of her voice to ensure her cover. It made me desire her more... But... She&#39;s not my mate. Why? My heart speeds up around her... I take a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s late by the time we arrive, yet the airport is alive! There are hundreds of them mobilizing everything... Joey takes my arm and guides us to a large hall with tables with platters of food. All of our things being labeled and I was given a card so I could get it latter. I handed it to Mom, I&#39;ll probably lose it, I see as her and my aunt go with my siblings and cousins to check out what to eat. Regardless of what the pack voted, I knew Kayden would choose her anyway and I was hoping for that. I had already spoken with my family and we had all decided that if Kayden moved to Karaya we would ask to go with him. Council be damned, my father died in the Great War and my uncle and older brother in a rogue attack two years ago. I&#39;m the only Gamma born left in my family and my brother as well as my sisters are Kappas. My cousin Carmela is a Delta but she&#39;s still 15 and needs a lot of training, she&#39;s been really practicing The Osupa Delta training. I don&#39;t know how I could handle loosing anyone else and when I saw how they lived I was sold, I wanted to give my family a chance of not having to look behind their back all the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus comes over with another Beta and Adam... I had heard Loiza had FOUR now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo Avis this is Beta Shomari, he will be helping us until we get initiated.&#34; His eyes... I don&#39;t want to link, I don&#39;t want to seem rude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I extend my hand &#34;Good to meet you Beta, thank you for receiving us!&#34; He smiles shaking my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Likewise &#39;mate, it&#39;s fine go grab some grub! Beta Marcus we do want to expand the size of the airport now that we are STOCKED, but Chandrama is on their way and they didn&#39;t have the luxury you guys had of being able to take your time and pack. Fortunately because some of the aircraft they used is a little older they&#39;ve made sure to take their time so that they arrived together, so it has slowed them down. That gives us time to take care of you guys and move you out before they arrive to give them also a chance to get a little rest before the ceremony in the morning, ok?&#34; I heard that pack is around 7,000 yup they definitely need us out, and it&#39;s true, we were able to take our sweet time. I can&#39;t imagine the stress they had to just get out. My sisters were able to pick and choose what clothes and shoes to bring and Mom brought two boxes full of family albums and heirlooms!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Beta, that is absolutely understandable, we know the conditions they have had to endure these past weeks. I&#39;ll make sure that the pack understands and we head out as soon as you instruct.&#34; Marcus was another I know would have followed Kayden regardless of what the pack voted on. Most were on board anyway and what happened yesterday made sure everyone who was doubtful changed their minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We head out at first light, from our reports that&#39;s when Chandrama arrives so please bear with us, you guys go eat up and rest we hope that by the afternoon you all have a home. You guys can pick and choose later where on the island you want to live! Once in the link you can contact those of Blood Moon that returned with The Osupa, they are already waiting for you guys!&#34; Over 400 of them saw THEN what we know NOW. A better life for our family. I saw how our Luna carried herself, I saw her coronation from the Goddess herself! When we found out she left it wasn&#39;t just Kayden&#39;s pain we felt, but our own. I could see how she treated her people, how she mobilized her pack to help others while they were refugees themselves! Kayden was right... She&#39;s no Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We ate to our hearts desire! Food from all over the world! We heard different languages be spoken, my sister Sierra and Carmela came over too exited to chill with the rest of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t wait to see our new home! The Sun is sure taking it&#39;s sweet time!&#34; Sierra says. Joey, Jason and Bree smile at them. I wanted to keep hanging out with her... But sunrise surprised us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember guys, we&#39;re closer to the equator line so sunrise and sunset will be very similar all year round. So you won&#39;t have to worry about daylight savings time or any of that! We have one season, an endless summer!&#34; She lights up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so glad our ancestors made the detour!&#34; She says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get us wrong we love the snow it&#39;s our specialty, but to know that in spite of the cold we can always go back and our home is warm! It&#39;s always awesome! Every new mission makes me love home more!&#34; Brianna adds. Detour?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone starts walking out and there are buses waiting. My brother is escorting Mom to the same bus Marcus is at and Joey starts going that way so I do as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joey what do you mean your ancestors made a detour?&#34; Her and her sister smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well if you&#39;ve noticed like my sister and myself, everyone in my family carries a particular mutation. Our wolves are white not native to THIS region. Our family originally comes from Scandinavia, when Spain offered Europeans to convert to Catholicism in exchange for land in the New World our pack decided to go with the humans and find a new home. Lo and behold the native werewolf population was on the run. We had a choice, we decided to stick with the native packs and join THEM, it&#39;s the same with the San Germaine family, they came from the outskirts of Paris. Both of our families joined the tribe BEFORE we had Karaya, before we were Osupa. Our family names are Legacies in the annals of our history! So when I mean detour, I mean 180 degrees!&#34; Marcus and I look at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;They REALLY love their home! What do you think she means that they are Legacies?&#39; He looks out at the lushness and beauty that the Sun is now uncovering. The weather is perfect!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;No idea, I guess we&#39;ll find out! This is just their airport dude! Can you imagine?! Our new home has it&#39;s own airport and three cities!&#39; Jason did mention that her family is a big deal here... So even though they are not originally from this region they feel just as hardcore Osupa as the rest. That&#39;s quite a relief, nobody wants to be treated as an outsider in their own home! Jason never mentioned being treated as an outsider, I just want my Mother to start smiling more. We start hearing airplanes... The other pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey guys I was instructed by Beta Shomari to escorted your buss to The Fort, it takes about half an hour to get there, we are JUST outside Itiba City.&#34; Jacob comes over and jumps on the bus with us. Damn he also looks like he has put on some MAJOR pounds! He looks so different from that runt that psycho Marius wanted to hunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So y&#39;all ready to see HOME?! We&#39;ll only get to see a bit of it but it&#39;s a nice drive.&#34; He tells the driver to head out. And as we leave we see the ocean to our Left, my sisters and cousins eyes pressed to the window, I put my arm around my Mom, she&#39;s taking it in smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Jacob where do you live man?&#34; Marcus asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We live at The Fort! It houses over 400 people, including us! Pheobe gets apartments since she is advisor to the Cacique. So don&#39;t be surprised when I warn you that this is a pack house on steroids, it&#39;s basically a castle!&#34; 400?! Castle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It used to house the entire pack at first!&#34; Joey adds. I look at Marcus he&#39;s just shaking his head in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buses drive off and we head for Itiba City taking the southern highway, Jacob explains that the other city, Atabex City, was designed and built immediately after they returned from Blood Moon to accommodate the huge dock that the Priestesses had created for their victory against The Council right on the shore. We learned about the other towns and how everything follows the Golden Ratio (yeah my brother had to explain that one) to give cohesion and aesthetic beauty. How everything in the island uses nature to power it, including most vehicles and how they&#39;re working on being completely fossil fuel independent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you telling me this island is that big? Does she intend on filling it to capacity?&#34; Marcus asks when Jacob told him the island can house about a million people comfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So far they intend on still letting people in until the mark of 100,000 is met and see how the island fares with those numbers. By sitting on the Cacique&#39;s Council, Phoebe is privy to a lot of information but her Oath doesn&#39;t allow her to share everything.&#34; No wonder she made this calling to other packs! I really had no idea the island was that big, and while we are on the road I am noticing that it isn&#39;t some little deserted island. We notice the road signs are in about seven different languages! I suddenly feel a shift in my feelings towards Joey... I can&#39;t put my finger on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are getting close, do you see that light house?&#34; Jason asks. And in the distance we can see a magnificent structure on a cliff with an old Spanish colonial style light house on a cliff next to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s a collective awe of wonder in the link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah but what is the building next to it?!&#34; Sarah asks from the back. It&#39;s MASSIVE and glistening in the early sunlight with a crescent Moon base.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, that&#39;s The Southern Cardinal Temple, The Lady Cresta is it&#39;s Guardian now but that used to be the Temple the Cacique used to be Guardian of before.&#34; Joey answers. What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joey that building is massive, are you telling me that she used to guard a temple that large on her own when she was 14?!&#34; Delilah asks standing a bit to see it better. I really didn&#39;t have any responsibilities at that age except to be as strong as possible and not screw up at school! I look over at Marcus and he at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Dude that&#39;s just ONE Temple... They have FOUR! I&#39;m imagining a smaller version of Loiza working in that massive temple, can you imagine?! She already had to rule that at that age ALONE. She has been practicing ruling, organizing ceremonies, etc. since that age. So it wasn&#39;t just the books and training, she indeed had that amount of weight on her shoulders all that time!&#39; He tells me. I saw those books... It was... Very enlightening. She&#39;s definitely no Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you would be surprised what a 14 year old Priestess can do, The Lady Yaya is still Guardian of The Eastern Temple, but now that Avalon is more involved and Priestesses are coming with their packs, and some from Faerie all four Cardinal Temples and several shrines have Guardians and most girls that didn&#39;t pass their trials insist on being Priestess Handmaids to assist.&#34; No wonder Selene keeps Blessing them, we didn&#39;t even have a shrine until Kayden ordered one made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We start seeing another massive white building right on the cliff. Jacob points at it: &#34;The Alpha&#39;s Fort!&#34; And by the Goddess it IS like a castle! I look at Marcus dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious Jacob?! That&#39;s where we&#39;re going?&#34; I ask. It&#39;s definitely no pack house!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup, it&#39;s been there for over 400 years, when our ancestors, the first Osupa found Karaya, that&#39;s the first formal building that they put ALL their work into. They had been driven out off the other islands and we were determined to keep this one from invaders. The walled citadel came after or basically the the historic part of Itiba City, later they built the modern part where most of the population of the island lives right now... The volcano attack was directed there. When we got here most of the debris and repairs had been cleared and done by the power of Avalon, yet they made sure to make it better, you guys will get used to it! The city in the mountains is almost complete and already people are moving.&#34; Marcus and I can&#39;t tear our eyes from it. And the city in the distance reminds me of pictures I&#39;ve seen of Dubai but except for dessert, it&#39;s lush and green! Plants dropping from balconies!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo look at the city! I thought it would be like a town or a village... That&#39;s insane! Is it me or do the buildings look like sea shells?!&#34; Adam can&#39;t believe it! Fuck I can&#39;t believe it! this is WAY more than what I expected! Everyone in the Link is so alert taking it all in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time we arrive, there&#39;s a cobble stone road leading to the magnificent building and has massive open grounds on both sides of the road with dozens of kids already starting playing soccer on the grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up with the kids?&#34; Joey looked confused and looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about &#39;em?&#34; And Jason comes to the rescue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah man it&#39;s cool, it&#39;s Saturday! The kids here really make sure to enjoy their weekend! You should have seen it in March! The kids fly kites all month celebrating the Spring Equinox and the arrival of the Northern Winds. It&#39;s an awesome festival!&#34; I look at my little nice with her mother... My brother would have loved to see them happy. I hope I made the right choice for them... As we get off the bus it hits me in the face! I look for the scent and Joey runs out to hug another girl who looks EXACTLY like her except for her hair... It&#39;s HER! No wonder Romo was confused about Joey! It&#39;s her twin sister who is MATE! She pushed Joey off and ran to me and like an idiot I couldn&#39;t help myself and go to her and she jumped into my arms! I fucking can&#39;t believe this! Where was she when The Osupa were at Blood Moon?! She takes my face and kisses me deeply and I am in heaven...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Avis mate, and I never thought I would find you!&#34; My brother links me to let me know to go ahead, that him and Carmela will stay with Mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Samantha...&#34; she whispers in my ear giving me goosebumps all over my body, damn it, focus idiot! Yeah you have her and they don&#39;t reject their mates calm down! &#34;... Everyone calls me Sammy and you are adorable Ginger Ale! Let&#39;s ditch all this, the moment you claim me, your in!&#34; And she kisses that ear... oh man! I&#39;m already feeling hard as fuck! So I just gulp and nod willing to obey any command she gives me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo Joey! Handle this please my dearest sister, I have a mate to claim!&#34; And before anyone could answer she took my hand sending an array of electricity and I can&#39;t handle myself anymore and kissed her again and take in her scent I have never smelled before...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Twinflower, Ginger Ale.&#34; she says as we walk towards The Citadel. &#34;It&#39;s a flower, it grows a lot in Sweden, I imagine you&#39;re trying to pinpoint my scent?&#34; I have to hit the books, there is so much history in this island is giving me whiplash!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was trying to pinpoint it! You are exquisite beautiful! So you&#39;re going to claim me?&#34; She gives me a devilish smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well duh! Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be kidnapping you right now taking you to our ancestral home in the citadel, it&#39;s small but it&#39;s always awesome to stay over. Our main estate is in the mountains.&#34; Estate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Are you some kind of rich girl?&#34; She smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just got here cutie and I assure you Avis you&#39;ll get to know EVERYTHING about me...&#34;</p>
