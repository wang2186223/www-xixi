                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take one of your men as a liaison, give me time and I will send you another invitation Kayden, choose the right man, if I find out of any transaction of information other than you he will find out how we got Chairman Tiago to sing like a little bird.&#34; I am starting to feel panic now, I am digging my fingers in her waist and I pull her closer to me putting my forehead on her chest, I hear her heart beating fast and she gave out a gentle whimper. Jason will make sure we look good, I need Marcus right now. She hands me a pearl from her hair, I hadn&#39;t noticed we landed where our plane was and we&#39;re alone in the helicopter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything I can say to change your mind Beloved?&#34; I take the pearl knowing that it wouldn&#39;t play out like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you can accept my offer. Kayden I just declared WAR on The Warewolf High Council, we are already getting strange reports from the fucking Vampire High Council and what is THIS?!&#34; She asks about the Mark on my wrist, I tell her that I wield Caliburn now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden do you KNOW what this symbol means?&#34; I have no fucking clue, I just know I want to stay holding her. &#34;You have no clue do you?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it fucking matter?! She said that it would protect me from Mordred, do you have any idea what sick shit he puts into my head?!&#34; I can feel her start pulling away but I keep holding her, I can&#39;t let her go again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you even KNOW WHO you are talking with?!&#34; No idea, it got me here WITH HER again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I don&#39;t Loiza! But I have a good feeling about it, she helped me get to you, that&#39;s all I want. I want to be with you at every moment that&#39;s all I want!&#34; She turns back and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that ALL you want?! Me?&#34; And she comes back to the helicopter she had already gotten off. And kisses me hard and breaks away. &#34;Guess what? I want my mate too, one who will trust me! But I need MORE than just YOU, I can&#39;t think on JUST YOU! I need a lot of work to finish to ensure the future reig--- of my people I have a LOT TO DO!&#34; She turns around again and gets down to give me room to leave. &#34;Choose a man Alpha or choose none, I am giving YOU the opportunity now to TRUST ME! Do you understand.&#34; I get off and I nod, she trusted me and I fucked it up. She doesn&#39;t want to be my mate just out of desire and she won&#39;t be manipulated that way. Now she&#39;s the one asking me to trust her, like I didn&#39;t before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason, how would you like to go on an extended tropical vacation?&#34; Yeah he&#39;s a good kid. And The Osupa start laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vacation?! No Mijo no! Jason you will be my personal guest and you will have one weekend to explore the island, after that you will be training under whom I command, you can vacation on your time. Kayden will continue to be your Alpha, yet while you are our guest you will follow MY command and I already heard of all this bullshit complaining at Blood Moon, you&#39;re all too fucking soft! I still can&#39;t believe your Epsilons only passed basic!&#34; What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;BASIC?! That&#39;s BASIC to you?!&#34; This is bullshit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to make your pack stronger, you have to learn to work as a unit no matter who composes that team. We didn&#39;t choose THIS team, but everyone knew their job!&#34; She comes over to me and hands me a white ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open web&#34; She says into it. &#39;Online&#39; &#34;This will help you see what we do in training &#39;search Delta Basics course&#34; And a hologram projector popped up with everything needed to train a Delta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you are captured you MUST destroy it! Swear it to me!&#34; I take it and kiss her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear it Love, I&#39;ll turn it to dust.&#34; I put it on and take her face, she tries to turn away, for Goddess sake woman let me get a good look at you! I put my forehead on her&#39;s. I kiss her whole face and I linger on her lips. She gives me this look of want and need and gives me another kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every week you will receive a coded transmission from Jason, get your best hackers to develop a system.&#34; She says while the others return to the helicopter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I said I left some goodies at my place, Leo take it to James and Percy they will know what to do with it.&#34; Josephine says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;And while I&#39;m still in your Link Network, I&#39;m leaving you with another gift. When we leave and your on the plane say &#39;Open web&#39; to the ring, when it says &#39;Online&#39; ask for images of The Alpha, whatever you see is classified and it&#39;s coded for your ears only, don&#39;t show anyone, it could get her and Karaya&#39;s greatest treasures killed, do you understand?&#39;... &#39;I understand, thank you.&#39; &#39;You&#39;re welcome, Baby Face out!&#39; She smiles and gives me a Peace sign. &#34;It&#39;s funny because we just declared WAR!&#34; And she starts laughing, they all do! I&#39;ve never seen what they can do, and this is just a handful of them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They leave, she looks at me and I feel like an imbecile for letting her go but at least I know I am not cursed or that I might loose her. She&#39;s giving me a chance to be who will not just want her, but trust her and see her for who she is. I go in the plane and find somewhere to be alone.</p>

                <p>&#34;Searching... Alpha Kayden Black voice key unlocked&#34; And right there was only one picture of them and a video. My hands couldn&#39;t stop trembling, our pups! Their hair is all their mother, their eyes are all me! They are perfect, they are BOTH Alphas! Their skin looks really nice, they don&#39;t look like newborns and I can&#39;t stop smiling!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Play video.&#34; And it&#39;s her! It&#39;s her giving birth, whoa my pups were born in the ocean surrounded by fucking mermaids!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>~&#34;Their coming fast mija keep breathing, stay calm.&#34; I have pups and I get to see them be born! I&#39;m NOT like Marius! Is that Luna Isla?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy you are doing awesome! Your making it look so easy.&#34; I&#39;m a nervous wreck just watching!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Alpha in the next contraction you feel push!&#34; She did this inside the water? Those two mermaids seem to really be helping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious right now! I&#39;m here pushing and you want to fix my hair for the camera Nina?!&#34; Nina was her sister right! That&#39;s the one that got Izzy the joint! Ha! She is really close to her siblings, if this is what it was with before with their parents, they probably hate mine. My pups don&#39;t have grandparents because one set helped kill the other and I killed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s crowning, the first one is coming.&#34; This is it right? Deacon is very alert. Is this how I would have felt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s out! It&#39;s a boy!&#34; Holy fuck he&#39;s huge! My poor mate! I take a deep breath. I could have been there! I could have held my pups in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The other one comes!&#34; A mermaid says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s out!&#34; A she? I have a son and a daughter! My baby girl was delivered by a mermaid! I look at their picture and yeah one is a little bit smaller and her skin looked like... I take the pearl Loiza gave me. It does look pearlescent, but the boy&#39;s skin is warmer, it&#39;s like mine, it has a hint of a gold tan to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, it&#39;s just her and she&#39;s not looking good here, there&#39;s a second message coded in the video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden if you are watching this it means I gave Joey the order for you to find the truth, she would be the only one connected with you. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t tell you before, you will find the particulars of the pregnancy in this file. I am working on how I feel about everything that happened, I know you didn&#39;t mean harm to my people, but you left us in a dangerous situation. You were just lucky enough to followed your instinct to put your parents under watch, but Yaya and I felt danger through all our stay. I can&#39;t trust THIS truth to anyone from your or any pack, I hope that I didn&#39;t make a mistake by trusting you with it. You know that they exist, you know I have been with no one else, so you know who&#39;s their father.&#34; She cracks a bit, I want to hold her so much. The person with her asks her if she can go on. I feel Deacon whimpering trying to hold her, Damn it! She tells the other person to give her some drops. She looks calmer now. &#34;I&#39;m going to be honest with you Kayden, I haven&#39;t been so well, I&#39;m a Gamma, I wasn&#39;t born to do any of this! I am a Priestess and I really loved being out on the field. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing half the time, but I KNOW I have to protect them... And I am not just talking about the pups. We aren&#39;t 10,000 anymore and I took on my duty as I always have, before me, the pack goes first, that&#39;s how we survive. If I took your man, he will be my guest, he will know the secret. Our children don&#39;t have to be in hiding here we have been taking every security measure, so when you do talk with him take everyone around you into consideration. I hope you send Marcus so he can meet his nephews, but I understand the need to keep your brother and Beta. When the time is right I will call for a gathering for a treaty, Blood Moon will receive an invite, I hope you don&#39;t decline it... I hope... I hope to see you soon Kayden. Keep checking this channel, I made sure it was top clearance, I will keep adding more images, so you KNOW this ring can&#39;t ever leave your hand it takes shifting into consideration, you don&#39;t have to take it off for anything. I have to go now Beloved, you ARE Beloved by me Kayden, don&#39;t forget that you idiot! I&#39;ll send you more books with my notes here as well, you can have my notes as a cheat sheet baby, but what&#39;s the point if you can&#39;t see the puzzle for yourself? The other book, I didn&#39;t leave it there, if she&#39;s reached out to you, follow her voice, read between the lines.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stops again, I see someone hands her some water, I&#39;m not there and she just had twins, she NEEDS me! &#34;Kayden I have been solving puzzles and cryptic shit my hole life, by now you must already know I have read it, it&#39;s not like she lets anyone read it. If she left it with you it&#39;s because that brain of yours CAN read it. So I would really appreciate if you could get a move on that! I already have two Betas working at balanced velocity, but by the way we are growing I estimate a third very soon and yeah I did it while pregnant. Aryn complains of having Study Hall with Deacon maybe she&#39;ll stop bitching about it.&#34; She rests her head on her hands, she looks exhausted. &#34;Well Love, wish me luck! I am about to declare war on The Warewolf High Council and any other asshole who fucks with my people.&#34; She&#39;s in tears at this point, and the person with her takes the camera.</p>
