                <p>chapter Washington DC.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Date: Day after the Global Terrorist attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could this happen?! We had already spoken about possibly being infiltrated by The Osupa, especially after finding out that their new Alpha was a spy herself! Armand and the others were stupid as fuck for attacking Karaya, we had agreed NOT to move forward with that nonsense and now my beloved mate is dead by the command of a BUTCHER!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are still trying to determine how many are dead, HELL! We&#39;re still trying to determine WHAT they used to blow up the buildings? They&#39;re pilles of ashen debris! We have yet to find a SINGLE corpse... They were just incinerated to NOTHING! And with the human authorities swarming every damn building to investigate, it&#39;s nearly impossible for us to conduct our own investigations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you think they were able to coordinate something this big? Is their technology THAT advanced that they can communicate this effectively GLOBALLY?!&#34; William asks furiously. At least our son lives, I have to make sure that he grows up strong, it&#39;s the least I owe Deborah. I still don&#39;t know how to explain it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father had warned them DECADES ago not to stir up that hornet&#39;s nest and after Alpha Loiza declared war we had advised to stop the extortion and attacks of the other packs! She literally EXPLODED them in front of everyone to see, we don&#39;t even know what fully happened when we sent soldiers into Karaya after the volcano ordeal! Just the gossip of a Priestess who was there and if that gossip IS true, the Goddess herself is kind of mad at US! So what EXACTLY is it you want me to say?!&#34; I don&#39;t know who to be mad at anymore. I WILL cut out that BITCH&#39;S heart out and have it as a snack, but these idiots are just as responsable and now they want WHAT?! Not even MY pack stands a chance against The Osupa and we are the largest in Europe... it doesn&#39;t matter if we&#39;re the last Lycan pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They hail her as Cacique... An old term the packs of the region used to refer to their Alphas before becoming Osupa. Apparently they see her more as a Queen, especially the ones of YOUR people William. I have been hearing rumors that there are Blood Clans ready to join her, apparently the Priestesses of Avalon want to help solidify Selene&#39;s power.&#34; Robert says downing half a glass of wine, he always has to keep his damn &#39;style&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deborah only stopped in New York before her flight to Zurich to visit with a friend and now I can&#39;t get a flight home because every single fucking plane on the globe has been grounded! We tried using our own private jets but The Pentagon grounded us too least we provoke them into shooting us down. Even TRYING to get in contact with anyone back home in the heart of The Alps is proving very challenging and at this point we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the humans messing with the world&#39;s communication systems or The Osupa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can hail her as the Goddess herself for all care! SHE HAS TO DIE! We can&#39;t allow to be this humiliated!&#34; Idiot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you a full on IDIOT Kelsey?! Even the probes we send can only get so close to Karaya before something happens that we loose the feed. Gee I don&#39;t know? Maybe the fact that we got as close to them to ALMOST DESTROY THEM, made them raise their already TIGHT DEFENSES! What do you want to do?! We don&#39;t even know what intel they have on US NOW! Hundreds of packs are wanting to pledge themselves at least to Avalon if not to her and leave OUR jurisdiction! THEY DECLARED WAR WITH EVIDENCE and WITNESSES! In the eyes of the supernatural world we all KNOW that most will see this attack as JUSTICE!&#34; I rub my face, the pain of not having her is taking it&#39;s toll. DAMN your stupidity Armand!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If even Blood Clans are joining I could infiltrate one and enter the island.&#34; William says like it&#39;s nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear that they have very gifted Truth Seers and they have the backing of Avalon! After two more Priestesses have joined The Cursed Roses, I don&#39;t see how we would find anymore Priestesses willing to help us. You can infiltrate all the Blood Clans you want but how will you enter Karaya William?&#34; At least Robert is keeping a level head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll find a way.&#34; William retorts. I am so DONE with all of them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I DON&#39;T EVEN HAVE MY MATE&#39;S CORPSE TO BURY, TO SHOW MY SON THAT HIS MOTHER IS DEAD!&#34; I roar getting up from my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I have in my head right now is how I&#39;m going to explain this to Liam, he&#39;s only five years old! No matter how much we tried in her Heats, we only were successful with him. We&#39;re supposed to help INCREASE the Lycan population again, but for all our efforts our numbers keep dwindling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father and I had heard rumors that The Osupa have a program with the SAME goal and are succeeding, we wanted to make contact with Alpha Gúarionex to negotiate a posible collaboration and Armand and his brat fuck it all up! How can I ever negotiate with a mass murderer?! I would NEVER allow that psychotic cunt near my son! Will Father still want to negotiate with them? Would he backstab me like that? He still IS Alpha... For him nothing is more important than that goal, even the Council can burn for all he cares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asher, I give my condolences AGAIN, may I remind you that your not the only one! My mate and daughter were in London! You don&#39;t see me loosing my shit, I&#39;m thinking about a thousand ways to sink that island! So I suggest you calm your fucking wolf!&#34; Robert thinks he&#39;s so fucking cunning! My mate was a TRUE Mate! Of course his pain isn&#39;t the same, his was CHOSEN. If it wasn&#39;t for Liam I would end myself right now gladly! I waited for her patiently without touching another female to make sure that I would be Blessed with my True Mate soon and when the Goddess granted my sweet Deborah when I was visiting the Dublin</p>
