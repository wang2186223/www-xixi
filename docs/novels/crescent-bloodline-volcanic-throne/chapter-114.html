                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I keep going through Gaia&#39;s grimoire trying to get more memories about reading it with Izz... I KNOW I have read this before WITH HER. Did we have a past life together? Is that why we&#39;re mated? Since the last time with her and going more into details of her life through the Mate Bond, it gives me that impression and has made me more focused on figuring this out. I have learned new languages as well as new fighting techniques that now come very natural much to Marcus&#39;s surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How on Earth are you doing that Kay?! It&#39;s like you are turning more like them by the day!&#34; Marcus asked after sparing and using some of the new techniques I got from Izz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first I fucking dislocated my shoulder and sprained my back with a few of them and it reminded me of the agility Izz used to fight Bayoán and her father. I started adding more stretching in my routine, Adam and Avis were on my back the whole time trying to match everything and passing it along to the others. Because of it and more intense training for the Epsilon sentinels led by Samuel, the few rogue attacks we have had, have been getting easier to terminate and word has spread that our territory is very well protected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lycan Blood in Tennessee has been getting hammered and their Alpha contacted us to help expand our territory and join our packs. He wanted to seal the deal by marrying me to his daughter, I declined that immediately but told him to come meet with us to talk terms. Endora warned me to be vigilant about it and I am definitely paying attention. Joey was sent here to train the Epsilons and verify if Endora was a Dark Witch, she found no foul play from her. It brings back the memory of Izzy explaining why she put a spy inside of my pack... &#39;Kayden I just wanted to make sure you were ok and look! You are!&#39; Goddesses I love that woman! And even though we are apart, I join her everytime she touches herself... Everything in her mind in those moments are of us together. I am so in tune now with her that I don&#39;t even need the ring. I know Jason will contact us soon... She wants to send a team here to train everyone in their respective fields. I can feel her stress from the packs asking for sanctuary in Karaya, she is very focused on that but wants us to be ready when the dust settles down a bit to invite us to join them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I already talked about this with Marcus, Avis and Adam and they were accepting of the proposal for the team to come train us. Last time we spoke with Jason he looked like he had added on about 20 pounds of muscle and can&#39;t stop going on about how he loves it there. He even started gloating to to them, Leo and anyone who would listen about how many Mermaids he had made out with! He even sent files with selfies with some of them. Needless to say some of the members were shopping for more tropical attire. When I told them about the tattoos they were not so trilled... Then Jason went ahead and showed his on his outer bisep along with the rest of his arm, the boy went ahead and got a whole sleeve done on his right arm and the selfies with the Mermaids showed that they had them as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamal, Murray, Khloe, Eddie and Savannah had already perfected it and I got another one on my calf and they decided on their own to get them. We had a pack assembly about that and the possibility of moving to Karaya. Endora decided to get the tattoo herself, she knew what it was and the power it held and explained to everyone that it is a powerful incantation to repeal demons from entering and possessing anyone. Also, her explaining that fact proved to her that The Osupa have taken these protection measures was a true testament of how seriously they take the security of their people... Everyone started to agree on getting them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got a transmission from Jason that very night explaining the plan Izz had of sending a team of professionals to train the pack and he was a little disappointed when we already knew. After giving more gloating about his exploits and people asking questions I made everyone leave hearing range... Which is pretty far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is she Jason? How are the pups?&#34; I ask wanting to know how his opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had a meeting with Alpha Loiza in her office the other day when she told me her plan to send the team there, since we&#39;re already under the jurisdiction of Avalon we&#39;re cool, but other packs want the same package. But for her to allow it they must enter Avalon&#39;s jurisdiction as well, some have accepted, others, not so. We have two new Betas and three new packs are on their way to join The Osupa. There is another that they&#39;re negotiating, the Alpha wanted a marriage pact with the Alpha.&#34; Already I felt my blood boiling, what in Hades is this fascination with sealing a deal with a marriage pact?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aaaand?&#34; I ask knowing that my mate doesn&#39;t take lightly to having &#39;conditions&#39; placed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, hells no! She had already placed an order that any pack wanting that could hang! Yet their Beta and the pack have rebelled and cut off the Alpha&#39;s tongue so he could not give any commands... Those wolves in India don&#39;t play!&#34; I can&#39;t help but smile!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the pups?&#34; I ask at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh man! They are growing hella fast! My rooms look over the now officially named Mermaid Lagoon, did you know she gave birth to them THERE?! Because of Queen Pasha&#39;s and the Mermaids assistance on their birth, the people have become very protective and welcoming towards them.&#34; Queen Pasha?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Queen Pasha, is she the white one or the black one? I saw the video and yeah it was awesome!&#34; I feel so giddy talking about this with someone else, I thought about telling Marcus, but I won&#39;t unless Izzy gives me the green light... And I sometimes regret sending Jason rather than Marcus... She even was hoping for it to be him so that they could bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah Boss, she&#39;s BOTH! She&#39;s two entities in one! She even gave them a special Blessing!&#34; Both?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway I can see the Lagoon from my room, the Alpha has been taking them often to start their swimming lessons! Everyone here learns how to swim as early as possible, I asked the Alpha if I could record it. She said it was fine as long as she saw it first and that she would send it to your ring through the encrypted channel she has for your eyes only. Her brother and his mate gave birth to a girl last week and they have started to join them for the lessons. They have huge pools inside The Fort but they prefer the Lagoon, she explained that it&#39;s best for them to get used to the salt water and getting their eyes used to the sting and in that I have to agree. At home we are used to the lakes and sweet water but when I started having fun in the beach I&#39;m still not used to the salt in my eyes and wear goggles and it amuses some of the ladies and the Mermaids find it hysterical, it&#39;s a bit embarrassing. Yet I still get the attention of the girls and it&#39;s a good excuse to beg them for help and they&#39;re not shy on helping poor little me... There&#39;s this particular girl that has my heart wrapped around her adorable little fingers and---&#34; Jason has become an even bigger flirt than I used to be!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason, buddy, I just wanted to know about my kids man. Keep your escapades for when you go off with Leo! I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re loving it there but it&#39;s making me want to just pack up and join you and I have to convince the WHOLE pack to want to do the same when we get our invite, so keep helping me out man! I&#39;m going to go now and tell the others to come here so you can convince THEM, I would already be there if I could. So record my pups getting their sea legs and tell Alpha Loiza that we accept any terms for a team to be sent over and to send me that and any recording of the pups, ok?&#34; I link for the others to come back and get more information about how Jason is doing over there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, and Jason which of Izz&#39;s brothers had their pup? Was it Bayoán?&#34; His mate has been pregnant since they were here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Morgana is due in a few weeks, it&#39;s Urayoán and Freya the ones who had their girl and she&#39;s super cute! She&#39;s almost a replica of Ura except for Freya&#39;s pale grey eyes. General Braka and Helena are expecting VERY soon! Alexis and Claire had another boy, too. She was prego before leaving Blood Moon, there&#39;s been a big baby boom and Beta Víctor is going on leave tomorrow for his and Lady Magdalena&#39;s Heat, and FYI, Kendra and Jolene are here, too! They are taking over Lady Magdalena&#39;s duties until she finishes her Heat and apparently will stay as her Handmaids, the gardens where the shrines are located are HUGE, I&#39;m talking acres! The other window of my room has an awesome view!&#34; Great! Jason has become a gossip too! Wait... Leave?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by going on leave?&#34; I can&#39;t help it, I promised Víctor I wouldn&#39;t get caught up with the gossip, but this sounds like an official protocol... Yeah, perfect excuse!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, when a mated couple get their Heat they get leave from work or any duties for how long the Heat lasts, that way the couple can focus solely on each other while the families go to the Shrines and Temples with offerings to the Goddesses to bestow upon them their Blessings to ensure that the Heat is successful! They also have leave when the pup is born to ensure that the new family can bond. Brianna took me to the Temple the other night and there was a WHOLE family presenting the new member on the altar and The Lady Cresta Blessing the pup, the ritual is very sacred to them and is performed under the full moon. It&#39;s like the entire family is giving as much of their life energy to the pup and if there&#39;s other people other than the family they also join in and give offerings for the wellbeing of the pup. They definitely live up to that saying that &#39;It takes a village&#39;.&#34; By this time a lot of the pack members were in the large comms room we prepped in the pack house so that they could listen to what Jason had to say about life in Karaya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I was in heat I had to wait for Robert to come home and was in pain all day!&#34; Someone said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They sure put family first!&#34; Was another. Great now I&#39;m going to have to start scheduling this in, Izz has FOUR Betas now and they already have a system in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo Jason! When did you start going to Temple man?! I thought you wanted to be the next Casanova.&#34; Leo asks chuckling with others joining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m trying to change my ways, I met someone really special and she turns 18 in a few weeks! I have been learning how to make offerings so that she&#39;s my mate! Dude she&#39;s Josephine&#39;s little sister Brianna, and her family is a big deal here on the island so I have been behaving since I met her last week, it was her older brother&#39;s pup being presented at the Temple and she invited me. You know that Josephine is actually a year OLDER than the Alpha and that she has a twin sister! You had such a crush on Joey... Maybe you&#39;ll have better luck with her twin Samantha...&#34; I left all of them so they could keep chatting and asking questions, he would have another hour to let them know of other festivities and daily life questions the pack liked asking Jason. I was already feeling my mate getting horny and already knew that it meant that I was going to have some self love but with her totally on my mind.</p>
