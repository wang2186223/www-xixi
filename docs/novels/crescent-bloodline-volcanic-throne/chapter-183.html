                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wake up a few hours before dawn. Izzy is in troubled sleep in my arms. I take in her scent as I kiss the top of her head as I listen to her unsteady breathing and the roaring ocean. I gently let go of her and see that Sophia awoke from her sleep on her new perch, I get up and head out to the balcony and caress her soft chest feathers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she knows already, huh? And I was dumb enough to think I can keep ANY secret from her anymore, after all these centuries... And as usual, she&#39;s not saying anything. She never likes to overburden me, neither of us has learned this lesson millennia after millennia. We have always shared everything, but if she knows I know something and haven&#39;t told her, she patiently waits until I do... I usually do the same. We should be solving it together, and we usually do, but I understand why she wouldn&#39;t say anything about this...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up in Avalon is no picnic. The fact that Izzy, Ayana and Cresta found a solid loophole to gain three full days of pure freedom each year was a stroke of genius. The hope of those days kept them going strong! Neither of them is a fan of celebrating their birthday, for them it was a day of unadulterated freedom in Avalon, but that&#39;s how their lives were measured, not a fun way to remember your birthday. For them their birthday outside of Avalon just reminds them that they were in a way slaves themselves. Nobody had asked these little girls if they WANTED this powerful burden! Some of them are very devoted and would gladly do it, but it&#39;s certainly not the majority. This is not the life I had hoped for my daughter and I KNOW she is FURIOUS! That&#39;s what woke me up...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We have NEVER bargained with the life of ANY of our children... He MUST have found her last time for us to go THIS far! We BOTH tend to be VERY sensitive when it comes to our children... ALL OF THEM!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gladly died for Ranulf who later became a great Alpha in The Highlands... The humans were terrified to go near his lands and only ONCE did a warring Clan dare try to take his territory only for Ranulf to end EVERY family in that Clan, tripling his territory. He built a grand castle by the North Sea making sure his mother&#39;s apartments faced east and had the best view of the water. Phi, in spite of her widow&#39;s grief, stayed on as Luna until he found his mate at 27 and even then he ordered a throne be placed on his right side for her as his Luna sat by his left. It was to her he would always seek advice first and she even sat on his War Council. She lived on to council and train our grandchildren and Ranulf placed her in a place of High Honor as his top advisor besides his Beta who was his brother and our second son Faoladh, who would himself seek council from her anyway. For a she-wolf in that time period in Scotland, her word was LAW, and no one dared challenge her. A command from my woman was seen as a command from Ranulf himself! She was always born to be a Queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Persephone was so moved that she commanded my Uncle... It&#39;s never going to not be funny how much power this child of Light has over the darkness that is &#39;supposed&#39; to be the &#39;TERRIFYING&#39; monster of The Underworld! Sorry metal heads... Hades is just as pussy whipped as me! Women are terrifying creatures! Sometimes I don&#39;t know if Eros did us a favor, it took me FOREVER to repair his eyes! She commanded him to coax The Fates to extend his life, but no one can coax The Fates. He, and all of our grandchildren and beyond are with Selene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia, let her keep thinking I don&#39;t know, ok girl?&#34; She nods obediently as I rub behind her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I head over to the nursery, Mónica and Danika, a new Chi apprentice from Blood Moon are coaxing a pup. They both bow before continuing to fuss over Bayoán&#39;s still nameless pup who was wailing, he and Morgana are still working on his name, and I understand. This pup is as much heir apparent to be Beta as much as Deacon to be Alpha, his name must be carefully chosen. I offer to take the boy and Danika looks at Mónica who smiles and nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here Alpha.&#34; She says softly still trying to coax the pup. But this is something that I&#39;ve done so many times that it&#39;s second nature. I sit down on one of the rocking chairs and put the pup upsidedown on my thigh and gently rub his back while softly tapping the foot of the leg he&#39;s on. He went silent immediately and was out in a few minutes, my mother Leto was treated like shit by so many because of Hera&#39;s jealousy, but her heart always remained gentle and she taught this trick to Artemis and me when she first held a crying Eros. Ares always had the doubt if Eros was his son, or Hephaestus, or Hermes... She&#39;s ALWAYS been special like that! I will never understand them, I may have MANY regrets with women, but that&#39;s one I never touched! She definitely earns the title of Goddess of beauty but not love, the only person Aphrodite loves is Aphrodite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However her son Eros should be hailed with that title... We were able to see Ares many lifetimes ago and because of the sense of smell we had we confirmed to him that he was indeed father to Eros. Ares may be many things but, he does share father&#39;s one redeeming quality of being a fiercely devoted father who dotes on his children. However, father HATES Ares! Especially because of his eternal rivalry with Athena... We ALL know she has ALWAYS been father&#39;s favorite. Besides the fact that Zeus always feared being overthrown and Ares was the most violent and rebellious towards him, some times Ares would just do it out of spite. It was hysterical!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hand over the sleeping pup to Mónica while she shakes her head smiling in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must say Alpha, you are quite skilled with the pups, can we help you or do want a job?&#34; I feel very at ease with her in charge of the pups, I can&#39;t wait to make more to send her way! She puts my nephew in his crib while I go pick up Jade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thank you ladies, I just came to hang out with this little lady, it&#39;s ok.&#34; They smile while going to wake Nyma for her bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past female Alphas of The Osupa, had denied their mates keep their title of Alpha... Izz decided that since she is mostly referred to as Cacique, she wanted me to KEEP the title. She saw that both the reigns of Kiskeya and Ayiti were VERY short lived and has a theory:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They MUST have done something wrong... They had no Luna, taking that natural nurturing need away from the pack and THEY couldn&#39;t grant it because they were Alphas. Isla will remain the heart of the pack, but the pack Link needs the Ying and Yang of both feminine and masculine to rule, without balance we invite chaos. I need you to keep your title my Love and I will keep Cacique, what do you think? That way we maintain that cosmic balance in the pack.&#34; What do you think? I started asking for the guy&#39;s opinions later on, the more time I spend with her the more I notice that she&#39;s ALWAYS done this, this is not Phi, this is Loiza...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like most rulers, especially Alphas, Elf Kings and Fae Kings just order their commands, Phi would consult grandmother, Artemis and me, she also listened to Hades, Persephone and Hera... Other than that, it was HER way, and she wouldn&#39;t ask for an opinion... Neither would I... we were so fucking arrogant! Hers has been melting away for some time, I need a bit more work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ironically, contrary from what people believe, Vampire Blood Kings DO have a more democratic system... Izz spent a great deal with the Lady Ziggy in her time in Avalon whom also mentored Yaya and Yaya is another Priestess that marches to her own beat. She was the key person who insisted that power should go to Izz and Gaia cemented it. I have read Orwell&#39;s second report and it&#39;s very promising...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled the sweet scent of my little princess and even though she was asleep I started telling her about her auntie Artemis and her adventures with the Amazon warriors. Danika sits down on another chair feeding my little niece and Mónica sits by us taking a break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, I didn&#39;t know you spoke Greek!&#34; Danika said in a hushed voice. I just wink at them both I&#39;m not really in the mood for explaining anything, I just want to imprint as much on my daughter as possible. Pups are already born with their mothers imprint, they were inside them after all, Izzy&#39;s scent will always live in her memory as well as Deacon whom she shared a womb with. Now I have to make sure that when she returns from Avalon, my scent will be familiar to her and one that brings soothing memories and comfort. Hopefully this will avoid the trouble Izzy had when she returned, we will have to teach all the kids while she&#39;s away, I will need Urayoán&#39;s help with that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dozed off before dawn with Jade firmly in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Alpha, this little girl needs to eat.&#34; I felt her waking me softly playing with one of my curls and giving me many kisses on my cheek. I smiled before opening my eyes. Danika was alone assisting Izzy and Morgana on feeding the pups and it seems Deacon is full, so we switch. DAMN how big is he going to get?! He&#39;s so alert and his grip is very strong! I take in his soothing scent and kiss my son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going over to the house later for brunch with Isla and Orocobix, do you want to go take them with Freya and Marcus to work on their swimming Beloved?&#34; I smile at that. I remember the images of them in the Mermaid Lagoon and how ridiculous I got about them being naked! Ha!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah! Definitely!&#34; She knows Jade will go to Avalon but not that she smells like her underwater, this will give me a chance to talk with Pasha. &#34;I&#39;ll take care of it, just stay focused and don&#39;t forget that if either Selene or Gaia mated them it has to have a purpose. Get the information you must, but remember that you really have no say anymore, the moment they received the Blessing of the Goddess their past transgressions are gone. Ok?&#34; She rocks Jade a bit while feeding her... I&#39;ve always loved watching her feed our children. She sighs and nods in reluctant acceptance. She looks up at me and smiles, those dimples always make me melt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys are too fucking adorable! Sorry about the Block Kayden, but I was following orders here!&#34; Morgana nods at Izz and Izz rolls her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine Morgana, it helped me out too!&#34; Yeah! It made me remember that living without her wasn&#39;t an option, it wasn&#39;t a luxury, it wasn&#39;t desire, it was LIFE. And the fact that she&#39;s preparing for the attack of a god means she DOES feel threatened, she would rather die than return to Poseidon and if she dies there&#39;s really no point on me returning. Hades has a place in Elysium for us... Our souls are those of deities, we don&#39;t go to Selene&#39;s realm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen to me carefully my boy, He WILL look for her, He will figure out one way or another what you did, if you were to run out of options you can always stay here. He can&#39;t enter my realm without my authorization, just like none of US can enter Avalon in our inmortal bodies... Here you can both be together, I would rather have my &#39;dear&#39; brother here in that tank though. But if neither Gaia or Selene have another plan, know that you two have a Plan B. And remember, don&#39;t betray Hera, as much as she loves Phi, she DESPISES you, so keep peace with her son, I was surprised our Great Mother told me WHERE to collect you and Amphitrite.&#34; He had even mentioned being worried she would change her mind before reaching The Underworld rushing his dark chariot. I remember how serious he looked as he rushed commanding his black steeds to hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took us with Persephone and Artemis to see the place he has for us in Elysium and it was exactly like our home in the shores of The Aegean. This would be our final resort and we were both ok with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Uncle, I think that it may eventually come to that.&#34; He shook me by my shoulders with an angry frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO! Don&#39;t think like that either, do you hear me boy?! It&#39;s a LAST resort! Focus on LIVING NOW... Once in my realm there&#39;s no return Apollo, NONE! Now that you&#39;re no longer a God is when you have to be at your STRONGEST! I&#39;m giving you a final solution to give you peace of mind, not for you to accept defeat!&#34; He always knew how to give a pep talk... As the ruler of Death, he never allowed defeat, as Death ALWAYS wins in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morgana, have you met Endora?&#34; Grandmother really went hard on her interrogation of Endora, but there was no need. I had already done a background check on her and another after I awoke... Her Coven cast her out over a misunderstanding and a mistake who left mostly Endora herself scarred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have, she&#39;s been helping with particular rites and rituals, I&#39;ll continue to teach her. If Maddame LaCroix is granted sanctuary it would be really healthy for both of us! I really could use some Coven love and be able to perform rituals and Calling the Corners!&#34; She gives Izzy a cheeky look from the corner of her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morgana, I have people checking them besides what Orwell and his team found, ok? That&#39;s why Phoebe isn&#39;t on island, we are mobilizing everything we have before the humans catch their bearings. So far so good, and I am inclined to allow them to come, but I want to know what brought on this war... Also, to be honest, the Shrines for The Orishas are in rough shape, I want them looking good. Víctor has Shomari&#39;s family working on that, but you know how many there are all over the island. Contact Adele, if Maddame LaCroix herself pledges the Coven and are willing to help with that project, besides everything else we require, I don&#39;t see any problem for them to come sooner. Deal?&#34; Maddame Adele LaCroix has been around for some time but REAL witches don&#39;t become famous in the human world. Morgaine LeFay is an exception because it&#39;s very difficult to silence and kill the name of a Legend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Izzy! I will portal over myself and join Phoebe and relay your request. I will ensure that everything is in order! It&#39;s going to be very good for this little one to grow up with that part of his culture. He&#39;s a Beta through and through, yet I can feel the power of my grandmother&#39;s blood in him, with more witches we can help guide him to avoid him from being consumed by her darkness. I couldn&#39;t bear another Mortiana...&#34; She becomes silent, we can sense her embarrassment and her eyes glazing over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morgana... you, Marcus and myself are not guilty of what our so called family did. I KNOW how you feel, my parents not only did what they did, they had plans for the destruction of Blood Moon if it went south. Marcus and I were just as expendable... Our own fucking parents! We didn&#39;t see it at ALL! They were very good to us as long as they held the reigns... I was a fool to believe my father named me Alpha early to guide me, he just wanted two indentured servants to administer their wealth!&#34; I feel the pain of their betrayal. I don&#39;t remember ever being born to parents like THEM... To grow up in a mirage of a happy, stable family... I do thank them for Marcus, he&#39;s been my anchor and yeah, I&#39;m really happy that he&#39;s mated to Natalia. So it&#39;s like I get to keep my best friend close by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Izzy shifts her gaze to catch any reaction from her, Morgana is in deep though holding her son firmly to her breast and he&#39;s ravenous but she&#39;s calm and looks down at the hungry little bundle in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks Kayden... That fucking bitch KNEW I was HERE! She was a fucking Priestess! She even visited us before Grandma passed and even got a Blessing from her and Mom! She didn&#39;t bat an eye knowing that she could kill me AND my baby! It&#39;s just so embarrassing, how COULD she do this?!&#34; I can already feel that the pup is receiving her distress. It&#39;s different for witches and she WILL need more than just Endora to help mold the new mutation. Izzy caught it fast and told Danika to retrieve the pup while her Light of Serenity shone through her sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hope grandmother doesn&#39;t find anything out of the ordinary with this Coven... Both Bayoán and Morgana will need their help. I look at the pup in Danika&#39;s arms and I to can sense the powerful blood of Morgaine LeFay in his veins...</p>
