                <p>Bayoán&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A week has passed since Izzy&#39;s pups were born. She was completely recovered as if she had never been pregnant at all!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That particular morning Víctor got his own tattoo on his whole back as well. I gave him mental snippets of having that thing inside me, how it used me, how Morgana&#39;s eyes looked at me because of it! It made him paranoid enough to get in Beta size. We also got a link from Izzy to meet her at our office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we went inside, there she sat at couch with a cortadito enjoying the view. She heard us go in and she had this giant smile on her face. Víctor and I knew this was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t had a good cup of coffee like this in a very long time! After having to deal with that trash they served at Blood Moon and opting out of things I enjoy to assure I give this pack the strongest Alpha, or in this case, Alphas, my body could possibly produce, it&#39;s quite the treat to have those things again!&#34; And she took another sip of coffee while we sat lounging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;It seems that it&#39;s fine.&#39; Víctor linked me. He only had one sister and has his brother Vicente. They weren&#39;t like us at all. &#39;You are so naïve sometimes.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why haven&#39;t we ever done any development in Karayita? I think it can have a little settlement for those who wish to be a little more secluded, what do you guys think? It&#39;s not like anyone enjoys it already. It would really take this breathtaking view to another level! And the smell of those flowers in the gardens! I have heard the Lady Magdalena has taking a special loving of the flowers and her Kappa skills are turning them to beautiful circle flower wreaths! Oh my Goddesses did I used to SUUUUCK at that in Avalon! How does SHE enjoy working so close to YOUR sent that she really doesn&#39;t get because YOUR nose outmatches hers by... Would YOU say at least 200% Beta Víctor?!&#34; DAMN! That was a nasty burn if ever I heard one! It was harsh and Víctor just couldn&#39;t deal yet that ALL of that WAS in fact THE BURN!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy seriously! Look at his face woman! I still hadn&#39;t prepared him for that yet! You just gave birth a week ago! Why are you here anyway?&#34; She takes another sip of her coffee and gives me a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet my dear red hot Brooklyn sister is very happy that she&#39;s getting you home early so that you really give it to her the way she needs in her last trimester! Helping her with a more speedy birth in the most natural way possible! I bet my own ass she&#39;s very happy! I swear to the Goddesses, being pregnant and giving birth to Alphas, at least without my mate&#39;s comfort, is the worst thing ever and then you fall in love with the little things! What kind of witchcraft is this!&#34; She takes another sip. She&#39;s worse than before!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sister coul---&#34; She just waves me away. She&#39;s basically said that she won period.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck yeah I came to gloat! But more importantly I want to interrogate the prisoners! Are you boys up for it? I need both of your calculations to be extremely precise today so are you guys up for some fun? Make sure Phoebe is there! I&#39;ll meet you at the entrance so we can be briefed on whatever stupid shit they&#39;ve already said this past month and see which one hasn&#39;t gone completely crazy yet! This is going be to like one of those pleasures I haven&#39;t had in a very long time and I really want to savor it!&#34; That did sound fun!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yaya is there as well staying out of sight and Braka&#39;s in the control room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she orders all the barriers down so they could hear her speak with the first prisoner only but they could only hear her, they couldn&#39;t be heard. She sits down on a chair and crosses her legs. She is wearing white on purpose to represent peace and calmness and everyone knew that white was a color of Mercy for the Goddess Selene. She has a hanging gold necklace strand which holds a variety of different stones of varying colors in intervals not only her medallion which sticks out as her symbol of power, these other necklaces displayed the variety of the people that were now Osupa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s talk... How long has it been since you have spoken to anyone? I&#39;m very sure that Alexandra is waiting for you! Is she your mate? A daughter? Have you been enjoying the food?&#34; She asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are... The Alpha of The Osupa?&#34; He said astonished and we looked at each other not really understanding his answer. He didn&#39;t seem all there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I am the Alpha! It says here that you&#39;re Hashaan. Tell me pretty boy. Why were you trying to attack The Weer?! Who&#39;s Alexandra?! If she&#39;s in danger we can locate her and extract her we just need exact information.&#34; This is basic ops, you ask the perp exactly what it is you want and to let them know that you have something of theirs in return and are willing to negotiate with them what could be the future that you may have. She says that we can do it very clearly she just never says we will, but making him think that we are in fact willing to rescue and put our people at risk for his mate or whatever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again it says here that you&#39;re Hashaan... Hashaan why were you attacking The Weer?&#34; He looks confused, Daniella goes in and injects him with Lucid potion. And he then looks better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo Hashaan! Why were you attacking The Weer?&#34; This is testing my patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They didn&#39;t tell us it was you doing those extractions, they never mentioned The Osupa I swear it we were on our way to The Weer from Tanzania with a group.&#34; &#39;He speaks truth.&#39; Phoebe tells us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not what I asked. I want to know why were you ATTACKING The Weer. Now this can play out two ways... If you&#39;re not going to talk then you don&#39;t need your tongue, your tongue has all those taste buds that let you enjoy the food you&#39;ve been eating. You can not tell me and loose it.&#34; And she puts pincers and a dagger on one side. &#34;Or you can talk and borrow this for 20 minutes. In case you feel like reaching out and talking to someone else.&#34; And she puts a satellite phone on the other side. &#34;Why were you attacking The Weer Hashaan?&#34; He is looking at his options. Víctor lays against the wall, he&#39;s not dressed in white. He&#39;s is in all black, attire without his suit jacket to showcase his packed chest holster. He presses a code into a control panel letting us now hear the other prisoners from The Gambia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You all heard the offer! Don&#39;t any of you idiots have anyone to call? For fucks sake you&#39;re breaking my heart!&#34; Víctor says. And some go to the bars burning themselves begging for the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You answer our questions and you may use it for 20 minutes! I am not negotiating. Afraid to call and have no one in the other side? I saw a few of you try to make nasty scratches on my niece walls, that wasn&#39;t a fun day, was it? Do any of you even know what day it is?&#34; Then on the third cell the prisoner talks... &#34;Alpha of The Osupa? I have information for you, please I need to know they&#39;re ok.&#34; She touches a few buttons on the tablet, looking at who she was taking with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re Shomari is that right?&#34; She goes to his cell and he&#39;s on his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Alpha, I am.&#34; The young wolf answers, I catch a South London accent, Izzy and Víctor caught it too. He must be about Ura&#39;s age, has very pale skin and a mop of curly black hair. Loiza orders that the bars be opened and Víctor just makes sure to stand closer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at me Shomari.&#34; And the young man looks at her. &#34;Get me an eye contact kit.&#34; And he&#39;s already nervous. Daniella gets her what she ordered and Izzy orders him to take them out. He hesitated but obeyed and took out his contacts, his eyes were pink!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re an albino. Why would an albino who grew up in South London attack The Weer all the way in The Gambia, Shomari?&#34; I ask him. I also like dressing nice for a good interrogation. Sure not as glamorous and regal as Izzy and not Angel of Death like Víctor. Just my regular black suit with white shirt and black tie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went to South Africa to get my three sisters and two cousins, other women handed me their children with albinism, but we were intercepted by Council Warriors, they must already taken them to Tanzania! I was trying to get us to The Weer to meet with you there, most of us wanted to meet with you to get out of our own particulars, for many of us the albinism in our genes makes us targets. They have my sisters Alpha, my cousins, the others are just pups! I went to swear fealty to you and they took them! What choice do we have if they take your own?&#34; I can see Phoebe linking her. She hands him the phone and has Yaya walk in the cell with the sound barrier up to listen in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Shomari let&#39;s see if you can keep your cool under pressure, right now you must understand that you&#39;re not in my good graces, yet you have my sympathy, I feel the Beta in you, make as accurate calculations and precise assessments of the situation, if you need more time Yaya will link me. But I want you to find not just your family, I want you to show me you CAN be Osupa, I want them all! If they are a target find them, usually the target on our back makes us learn how to bend and adapt, that helps evolution. Make the call and gather as much intel as to where they&#39;re holding anyone if they actually decided to keep anyone alive and their coordinates. Raise the barrier here!&#34; She tells control. And he goes to task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it like this for all of you, are all the those you&#39;re trying to get out albinos?&#34; They all say yes, but the one next to Hashaan, grabs Phoebe&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one lies my Queen! He is one of them, he is Chairman Tiago!&#34; Are you fucking serious?! I go over and look at him. He had a long beard, son of a BITCH! We had him! He was using glamour magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get him out of there shave him and get him looking nice! When he is ready you will only call Víctor and me I want him in the last cell on level 3, and a very good camera I want him sharp for his close up. Izzy handle this, we&#39;ll get what we need from Tiago&#34; She nods at me, she really never likes this part of interrogations. I look at Víctor... We DO!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want signed confessions and detailed explanations on what happened to you, how you were threatened and coordinates of where your families are if they live.&#34; Izzy tells them, she&#39;s planning another extraction. &#39;Izzy are you serious?&#39; With her Alpha voice commands me to do my job, I felt she gave Víctor the same command. And she goes to the command center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take off my jacket and hand it to Jacob who for some reason wanted to be here saying he was bringing Phoebe a snack... Whatever, as long as he keeps it nice, that was tailored to perfection by Master Oscar. Víctor already had his sleeves rolled up I decided to do that as well, it&#39;s also custom tailored! Before we enter the room, we are given some particular contraptions called Kosiooruns, for our noses. This particular room was enchanted over a century ago as the worst phycological torture chamber. It goes into your mind, searches out the scent of the ones you love the most and have that scent smell of death, decay and decomposition... The scent comes from everywhere and you can&#39;t escape it, even when you hold your breath.</p>
