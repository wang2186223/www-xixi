                <p>Bayoán&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morgana and I finally decided to name our son after Yacahüey. At first I wasn&#39;t on board, I mean the guy was a total badass but his and his family&#39;s demise was one of the saddest stories of our family history! I saw it as a bad omen. Yet Morgana kept getting dreams of him with Adelola next to him. She went to the Burial Chamber and brought offerings for him and his family and a jar of raw honey pollinated from orange blossoms for Adelola&#39;s council.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already Nina has the design ready of how she&#39;s going to redo it and there were consumed offerings she had brought with a copy of the design hoping for the approval of our ancestors, especially Adelola and Imotonex. None of us would dare make changes without communion with our ancestors. Nina left the copy of the blueprint during the New Moon symbolizing our humbleness and sincerity, we are strongest during the full moon but we also have less control. When Nina went to check the chamber the next day it smelled like lemons had exploded all around giving us the green light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have never had an apparition of Adelola, however I remember Babushka saying that when she did the chamber would smell of fresh lemons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina lit frankincense to call our ancestors forth, a very typical ritual to purify the mortal world to allow them passage. Yahir and many from Alhilal Almuqadas want to finance a chunk of land east of the airport which is pretty dry to grow several species of dates and frankincense trees... The Agricultural Department of the University is verifying if the crops would be viable to grow there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both are good crops to have since right now we import both from Oman... If they say it&#39;s possible to grow a quality crop here, we will definitely grant them a subsidized loan. Nobody has wants that land because of how dry it, is making it ridiculously cheap! Janaína and Víctor are in agreement of just giving it to them since the whole pack would in fact benefit because it would mean not having to deal with all the hassle of importing the goods to Jamaica and then transporting it here. The dates are mostly for special dishes Samira and other Chefs make and it&#39;s convenient... The frankincense however is another story. The Temples burn it from dusk till dawn and all the Shrines burn it for special ceremonies, even Morgana and Endora need it for special rituals and with a whole coven coming here we will have more demand. Yet the tree is becoming endangered, so Jana and Víctor have a point. Knowing Izzy and her own love for the scent and knowing it&#39;s value, especially as a Priestess, she&#39;ll more than likely agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morgana made a five star pentagram of salt placing the element that goes to each point and lit the frankincense on the top point, sat in the middle of it and started chanting a prayer that Adelola had written herself in patois in reverence to Changó and to the ancestors who came before. I just sat in the bench trying to channel our doubts and the answer to the riddle of my mate&#39;s dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly I started seeing what Morgana said she saw herself in her dreams and I felt a serene peace and when I opened my eyes Morgana&#39;s eyes were fully black and started speaking in mix patois...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wattagwan wid you mine pickney? No bodda for our darling babi who is greatly Blessed. Mi beloved Yaca an di girls had a tragic demise yet his life was full. &#39;Tis one of the saddest days fi a madda to lose her first born pickney and Imotonex fasted for a month, suh great did fi him devastation. Mi si great things fi dis beautiful pickney of fi wi house, just because Yaca met a tragic end it has nothing to do with our new little Beta witch. When we name a child after an ancestor &#39;tis to celebrate them life, not them death. Yacahüey&#39;s name wi bring more powa tuh di pup&#39;s aready promising bloodline.&#34; Morgana stayed like a statue, unblinking. I still can&#39;t believe I&#39;m actually talking with Adelola herself!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great great-grandmotha mi deh yah, suh yuh sey it fine tuh name mi babi wid fi him name?&#34; It still worries me to no end. I never imagined I would become so jittery as a father, how did Dad and Mom do this with the SIX of us?! How did Imotonex and Adelola do this with 14?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yuh too superstitious mi pickney! It wi all be irie. Yuh muss truss yuh grandmotha inna dis.&#34; She seems very persistent in this, especially if she has been trying to connect with Morgana to get her point across. Morgana&#39;s eyes were going back to normal and she was waking from the trance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even Adelola knows how superstitious you are my handsome wolf! Ha!&#34; She says as she gets up and dusts herself. Great! Now she&#39;s totally going to ram that in for months! I help her clean up before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok? Did you feel any discomfort my Love?&#34; She looks tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, it was soothing. But I am a bit drained, I&#39;ll go to the Shrines to meditate and get the naming ceremony set up for dusk with Magdalena. She is however very pleased with how we all came together and are strengthening the family and even engraved some additional spells in my mind to add to her grimoire for various situations, I intend to pass it to mine and start prepping for... I guess we&#39;re going to name him Yacahüey then? I don&#39;t know about you but there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going against Adelola on this, she seems to want the best for our boy Bayo and she&#39;s already given him gifts of various spells for his own grimoire. I felt her wish about him being guided correctly in magic as well as his Beta blood.&#34; Well I guess that&#39;s settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if I&#39;m going to go against the wishes of an ancestor AND Morgana! I have to much other shit to deal with like getting off this Leave! I&#39;ve been giving Morgana everything she needs and having her and the pup&#39;s scent near is incredibly soothing, but as much as I complain about being a Beta sometimes I miss being in the middle of everything. Shomari gives me news on everything that&#39;s going on until Víctor comes nagging and I can smell Izzy behind this, too. I just have one thing to say to Morgana about it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes dear, is there anything you want me to do?&#34; I&#39;m fine with the name, Mom and Dad named Nina after his wife Guanina who died in that same tragedy and she&#39;s fine! I have to get a grip!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morgana started laughing at my clear indication of acceptance and pulled me down to her to kiss me, this woman just does what she wants with me! I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you finally have a name?&#34; Maco asked. I stayed behind in the house since Cesar and Catalina were moving into the Small House today and I still had somethings there and Amelia had sent Nasser to go get some takeout from his sister&#39;s restaurant. The house is so lively with Lola, Ishaan and Santino staying over, Adam&#39;s nephews love coming over to play with some of Ishaan&#39;s niece and little cousins and Nina and her crew taking measurements and additional studies of the soil to ensure the structures integrity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wants the Burial Chamber done before focusing on the village by Hacienda Florencia that&#39;s been called Villa Florencia since it&#39;s forever. That way there will be enough living space for Ishaan&#39;s family, many of them have already moved into the houses that Nina&#39;s team have approved as safe and are helping themselves with all the repairs and Ishaan and his brother have offered to buy the village from us to start creating their own legacy within the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maco and Amelia decided that since we don&#39;t have any real use for a village since we already have so many properties and projects, they&#39;re going on to sell it at half the value. With the size of the Khatri family and the fact that they have several ranks especially Warriors, techs and Kappas, it would be wise to definitely help them get a good place in the packs hierarchy and have them as strong ally within the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I don&#39;t really have much of a choice in the matter! Dude I just spoke to Adelola! Has she spoken to you?!&#34; I open a beer for each of us and he clinks it with that dashing Maco smile!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually no... The one she has taken a liking to talking with is Amelia and Em goes down every other day making sure that everything&#39;s in order before the work begins in a few days. And yeah I don&#39;t have any say on my daughter&#39;s name either! When Bisabuelo said that the pup would be a Beta Amelia had already insisted she will be named Asenath and Great great-grandmotha already stamped her approval! Ha! Do you think Imotonex had any REAL power in this house!&#34; Maco chuckles as he sits back to take a break from getting all his crap out of the sewing room. They&#39;re taking all of his and Gadiel&#39;s prototypes and projects to their new building downtown that Bisabuelo gave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Head of the family, Maco has already made all the arrangements to recognize the Guerrero family as our kin and Janaína has already prepared a press release to inform everyone and that the DNA records of EVERY single pack member would be double checked. We can&#39;t FORCE anyone to acknowledge their bloodline as family, but it has to be in the database! This has nothing to do with filial ties and everything to do with medical safety since we make most of our components for health, camouflage, even weapons based on DNA... I have been going over Dad&#39;s diaries and they don&#39;t say shit about it! I love and miss that old man but damn it this was reckless as fuck! Sigh...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asenath will be a fine name for our little nice! I&#39;ll make sure to verify both her and Yaca&#39;s curriculum, at least they&#39;ll both be starting together.&#34; I&#39;m just a little worried about Nía... Her own Heat should be coming soon. She had barely turned 18 when we had to evacuate, because of her age and since she&#39;s not an Alpha, the Goddess in her wisdom can delay a female&#39;s Heat. But those two are stuck at the hip and they both have been getting extra training from Ura and Maco and they want to make the trip to Oman to negotiate costs for seeds and baby trees for the farm they want, Fatima and Roxy want to go too and they&#39;ve passed their test to travel. I told Nía to deal it out with Víctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re going through with Yacahüey as our new pup&#39;s name? Looks like Adelola will definitely ALWAYS have some power over all of us! I&#39;m just glad she&#39;s on our side brother! Papo was here the other day to check out the layout Nina had designed for the Burial Chamber, they want to redo theirs too and after sat in the garden for a bit after. He says that he also wanted some council... Dude, him, Jorel, Paco, Pepe, Germán, Gisela, they&#39;re trying to deal with Fernando and try to get rid of their hoarde. I&#39;m meeting him tomorrow with Nina to show him the numbers of what we made from selling all the crap we had to the Historical Society and all the items that they might want to borrow in the future as descendants themselves. Enid sent Joey and Bree since they get those honors as well. Good thing is Enid and Marianela are coming with us to see if we can talk some sense into him, it&#39;s a bitch going over there for the Day of the Dead celebrations! We bought two lots in Karayita and Tony bought the one right next to us for almost nothing! Hopefully this will give him a new incentive to sell at least HALF of that hoard!&#34; Yeah no shit! If their house didn&#39;t have the same protection spell placed by Adelola herself all their crap would be ashes. I finish my beer and pat my him on the shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;m just glad I don&#39;t have to deal with that shit! Good thing you&#39;re Head of the family big brother!&#34; He sneered at me giving me the stink eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gee thanks!&#34; He says as he pinched the bridge of his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! I have a naming ceremony to set up for dusk. See you then?&#34; He smiled and raised his beer...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be there brother! To Yacahüey Mirabal-LeFay! I&#39;ll make sure to add him to our book!&#34;</p>
