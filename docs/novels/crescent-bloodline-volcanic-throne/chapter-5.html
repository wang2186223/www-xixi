                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mind link Alexis, one of our Kappas and one of our best cooks: &#39;Alexis, you once cooked a very good meal of Caribbean food, is it one of your specialties?&#39; I want The Osupa to feel welcomed. &#39;Yes my Alpha, I am Osupa, are you all in the mood of gastronomic bliss today?!&#39; He asked with a chuckle. He did not know. &#39;Alexis come to my office and bring some of your Sous chefs with you, I have news that you should know.&#39; I will let my mother handle and give commands for the comfort of The Osupa. In the meantime I have to make sure that the security of the borders is at its highest, the Osupa will be weary when they get here, and they&#39;re not a pack that was used to being attacked in the middle of a crisis. So naturally I want to make sure that we received them without any outside trouble. Especially since they are outside the jurisdiction of the High Council, and that can only mean that they have resources that the High Council wants and they are not willing for them to have it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father approaches me I can definitely see tension in his eyes and I can see that whatever he has to say is important...&#34;Kayden, now that everything is in motion, there&#39;s some things about The Osupa you and Marcus should know.&#34; He says in a warning tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father I am well aware that they are ferocious Warriors, I&#39;m also aware that their spy Network is the best of any pack on the planet and that information is their most valuable commodity.&#34; I know a few other things as well but this is what I believe my father wants to talk to me about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of that is true son, there is more, the one thing I am a bit apprehensive about between their pack and ours and the Blue Moon Pack  for that matter has nothing to do with their ways of War. They are... very unconventional to our standards and to that which we already know.&#34; Well I&#39;m a bit intrigued... &#34;Ok?  Unconventional?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexis is here because he found his mate here&#34; My father starts &#34;...and Alexis&#39;s family was mostly gone, but his mate Claire has a large family that she could not bear leave. So he left his Pack for hers. Not that that is something extraordinary, what is extraordinary is the mate Bond and what it means to The Osupa, especially for Alphas. I have no doubt in my mind that many of our pact will find their mates among The Osupa, with their numbers dwindled the Moon Goddess will make sure to make quick repair of that... but they have just received a terrible blow and like I said, their methods are unconventional. You must prepare our pack, I will infom this to Alpha Marius, although I feel he already knows... for The Osupa, the PACK comes first and they have perfected the mate Bond to the point it adjusts itself to the needs of the mate. And right now they are all in pain, they are homeless, and more than likely have been decimated... And for a pack as powerful and strong as them, they must be demoralized and lost. We still don&#39;t know how many survived, or who survived for that matter. There may be many joyful reunions between new mates, but the wolves and She Wolves of our pack as well as Blue Moon should be ready to not be accepted immediately. The Osupa have never been known for rejecting their mates, they trust the Goddess and her will, so you must tell everyone who wants to keep their Osupa mate to thread lightly and learn to adapt to their needs. Also they are not very shy, unlike us they do not keep clothes around the woods in case they have to shift, if they shift and there is no clothes around they continue on as they are. They actually find our need to get dressed immediately quite hysterical. I fear this may cause some friction between unmated males, they just don&#39;t see it as taboo. For them they are naked the day they are born, they&#39;re naked while they are in wolf form, and if they are naked after they shift they don&#39;t see it as a problem. There is more but it&#39;s just mostly about how they behave, the important part is to tell the pack that they mean no bad blood or harm in it, on the contrary they fought in the last great werewolf war to try to keep it from spreading globally, and although they are highly skilled and trained they tend to keep things peaceful. Do you understand everything I just said boys?&#34; This left me thinking. I look at Marcus, a frown on his face, the subject of mates facinates him and makes him exited to find his own mate. He is even saving himself for her. Pffft!!! If I would have waited my balls would be blue by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess that makes them quite the open-minded thinkers.&#34; Was all the response I had to all of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s more than that, it&#39;s the key to their power, with the mate Bond the male becomes more subdued and thoughtful when he battles because his mate usually fights beside him, when I saw it myself in person, it was like a dance... a dance painted in red, the pack in itself learns to synchronize their attacks, but when they fight with their mates, it&#39;s like they feel exactly where their mate is and what they&#39;re going to do, they work as a unit of defense and offense. It&#39;s actually quite beautiful to watch. The Moon Goddess has blessed the females to the point that the males adapt to them in the mate Bond, and this actually helps the male&#39;s to maintain a cool head, so if you ever hear a male or female Osupa growl, you have already crossed too far and don&#39;t expect it to be a warning, the next thing that comes will be an attack and blood.&#34;  My father finishes. And with that he tells Alexis to enter...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see my brother in very deep thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume you know what&#39;s going on by now?&#34; My father asks the Kappa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder I have been feeling uneasy all morning, at what time do they arrive so I know how much time I have to prepare a welcome meal and a large dinner for later?&#34; Alexis asks very seriously, as if this mission is one of life or death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They will be reaching our territory around 10:30 in the morning maybe 11, we&#39;re working on medical needs and housing right now, I&#39;m putting you directly in charge of what and when they eat.&#34; I tell him with a little bit of caution, I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s hurting as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Alpha I will make sure that they are well taken care of and that they have meals that at the very least remind them of home and fill their soul.&#34; Alexis says as he walks to the door with head down, he calls for his two chefs and starts calling out ingredients that they have to write down to go to the market. I already know it&#39;s going to be a very long day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to my brother, still deep in thought... &#34;Well someone is day dreaming!&#34; I tease him, but I know him well enough that I know he doesn&#39;t give a damn. &#34;What father said... I read about it once in a book in the High Council&#39;s library, they have a very strong bond to their mates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what? The Council keeps tabs on our mating habits, nothing new.&#34; I scofed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear to the Goddess brother you&#39;re so absent-minded sometimes, didn&#39;t you understand? The Osupa are not under the jurisdiction of The Council, so why is The Council keeping tabs on them?&#34; He asks with an even bigger frown on his face. &#34;When last there I saw many tomes about The Osupa in a hidden part of the library. Why would The Council keep information on them, in the open, if they are outside their jurisdiction?&#34;</p>
