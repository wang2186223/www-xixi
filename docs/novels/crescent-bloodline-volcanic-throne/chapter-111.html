                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayden made true on his promise, I was in the most delicious pain after that week. Isla had the mattress of my bed removed to be disposed of and was asking questions non stop. It wouldn&#39;t be so annoying if everyone hadn&#39;t found out about the mattress... It&#39;s condition... well... Let&#39;s just say that the claw marks and blood didn&#39;t make it less embarrassing. Every night after he left I would ask for ice from the kitchens and would just lie in bed with the ice bag between my legs until I regenerated, still I wanted more of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Goddesses Izzy there was more bodily fluids and destruction on it than a crime scene!&#34; Nina, Ura and a almost due Frey, started pestering me. We were in the balcony having lunch with Isla who also found it hysterical. I didn&#39;t really care, I still felt him inside me. Last night was the last night we negotiated for him to come... My Block was done recalibrating and now I was just full of confusion. But it is what it is, I really need a clear head now to be able to ensure that those who are allies are protected, including Blood Moon. If we achieve this I could help Kayden persuade them to come here, he wanted to stay with me back in London, how could I permit that? I won&#39;t allow my mate to abandon his pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was stupid enough to think that with my emotions as they were, that week would be stale and emotionless. I was so foolish to believe that I had fully consummated my mating with Kayden, I couldn&#39;t stop thinking of how he fucked me. He was merciless and I loved it, I even did feel love for him, how could I not love someone who was making me feel pleasure to that extent. I wanted more, and I couldn&#39;t stop smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Earth to the Mighty Alpha! Hades Izzy! Where is your head? He can&#39;t be THAT good!&#34; Nina says while drinking her coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have anyone to compare him to so I don&#39;t know. All I know is I thought I had experimented quite a bit, only to now know I didn&#39;t know jack shit. The first times he gave me comfort, he gave me what I needed, he was rough enough. This time... This time he did whatever he wanted and everytime I would be curious to see how it would feel and he didn&#39;t do a single thing that I didn&#39;t like. He let Deacon out plenty of times so I would let Aryn have her way.&#34; I say looking at the ocean. Deacon wanted to impregnate us again, but we&#39;re not in heat and are breastfeeding. By the Goddesses, we better have all this sorted before my next heat or my pain will be unbearable!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Daniella says you are fully healthy now and won&#39;t have problems with feeding the pups for at least a year. But I am more happy for that smile that he has left on you mija, Goddess knows that the connection with our mates is crucial. You wear a beautiful blush!&#34; Thanks Isla, that just increased my blush and the smile I can&#39;t get off my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want everything to be sorted out here before we formally invite them, I really want us to be ok before my next Heat, I&#39;m going to go crazy!&#34; I say bitting my bottom lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about that either, just stock up on Jading potion! That&#39;s what Antoine and I are doing. He&#39;s staying this week in Atabex City and I will be here, after much debate we decided to try for a pup on my second Heat.&#34; Nina finishes her coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, you&#39;re in heat NOW?&#34; Freya asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup! We want a little more time to have fun as mates before pups come and we have more distractions.&#34; I was going crazy when I was in heat and I hadn&#39;t been Marked and mated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HOW?!&#34; Both Frey and I exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a flask of Jading potion and my mate is in another city. We made sure that the places each would be staying would be free from each other&#39;s scent and yeah, I&#39;m not happy, I feel he&#39;s not happy, but this will at least buy us half a year of more of the fun that Izzy seems to have enjoyed this past week... Sans the destroyed mattress. Hades Izzy! That mattress was new! And in a week you and Kayden turned it into a forensic nightmare! Seriously? Blood, cum, claw marks?! If this gets out it&#39;s going to be trending!&#34; I couldn&#39;t help but smile more. On the first night alone the mattress was going to have to go, but I might have raked his back with my claws as he fucked me missionary, as I gashed his back he growled but he didn&#39;t even slow down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we finished that round he was almost healed, I apologized but he laughed and asked me to take a picture of it... I found it funny too until I went to take the picture and noticed that the tattoo was healing perfectly yet it was distorted until it finished healing. I accidentally dropped his phone and started panicking, he noticed and told me to put my robe on and he would wait in the balcony until it was fully healed and we waited for a bit. I peaked out and he ordered me to go back inside until he was sure that there was nothing in him. I was so angry at myself, it was so stupid! I waited for half an hour lying down on my divan sofa in fetal position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I felt him crouching next to me. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I am an idiot! That was so careless.&#34; I said. He untangled me and kissed my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now I feel like the idiot! I shouldn&#39;t have gotten that ink on my back. I loved what you did! I even wanted a picture... I wanted evidence that my mate was an animal in the sack!&#34; And he got a smile from me. &#34;Baby it&#39;s ok, I&#39;m fine, I just want more.&#34; And he parted my robe and started playing with my breasts as he licked my mate Mark and again I was his. But the evidence was the mattress which he did take a picture of. Now that my Block was almost back to normal, I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it... He said he would get another one somewhere else so that I could feel free to do with his back as I pleased. Remembering it made me bite my lip and I felt my blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I want more too...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, after feeding the pups and putting them to sleep I still couldn&#39;t stop thinking about my past nights with Kayden. I lay awake restless... I got up and took another shower, as freezing as possible, still I was horny. I laid naked in bed and started to touch myself, I had the shirt that Kayden gave Bayoán so that each pup could have one... I just cut the first one in half and kept that one for myself. With his scent and thinking of the things we did this week, I gently massaged my breasts while my other fingers massaged my clit and I intensified the speed until I came... Only after three of those did sleep come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still could feel my dick inside the softness of her. Every article of clothing I had taken with me was in a basket next to my bed filling my room with her scent... I was drunk with it and then suddenly I felt it... She was touching herself! She was thinking about this week and I got hard instantly. We were just finishing a meeting and I dismissed everyone with a lame excuse and that we were done and I was tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got to my room in seconds and got some lotion and stripped. I was focused on her, her scent and I opened my Bond to her to get every image she was thinking about and I started stroking myself. I felt her lust, her want, that primal side she showed me this week and I stroked myself faster. The moment I felt she came I couldn&#39;t handle it and came myself. She masturbated more and everytime I would join her. After waiting to see if she would go again and nothing I took a cold shower and kept looking at the picture of how we destroyed her mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was in the balcony waiting for the tattoo to heal I could feel her panic and regret... My panic matched hers, but I talked today with Jamal, one of our Kappas who I gave the specs for the tattoo. He got some skins of some deer that had hunted and has been practicing. I want to get another one on my calf so that she can claw my back again if she wants, what she had showed me of herself before was more tamed, this time she showed me a true Alpha&#39;s lust and I loved it! I want her to let herself go everytime we are together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before returning last night, Víctor told me that they are working on somethings that are emergencies but to start verifying if Blood Moon would be willing to move to Karaya and like the other packs who have joined them, submit to HER.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why we wanted a liaison... We want someone of your pack to live as us and see if Blood Moon can adapt to us and us to you. Listen man, I KNOW that YOU would more than likely submit to her, but I know Izz wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable with you abandoning your pack. It&#39;s not her way, she will want everyone&#39;s safety and your pack not to loose respect for you.&#34; I had known this already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem to know how she thinks very well...&#34; I said looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it! That&#39;s right. Bayo sent you to Paco for your tattoo... Kayden, as I imagine you have figured out, gossip is indeed alive and well in our pack, it&#39;s become... cultural.&#34; He rubs his face in agitation. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t think so with our numbers, but many of us have surrendered to our centuries old bad habit. Yeah, I know her very well and like I said before, I RESPECT her. I&#39;m a mated wolf and worship my mate, whatever happened between Izz and I before is in the past and like I told her brother, I&#39;m not going to say shit, so whatever questions you have, ask her, but I assure you that you don&#39;t have to feel any jealousy, we are trying to be friends... From what I heard you had PLENTY of women before... Since you found your mate, do you find ANY interest in any of them? Have you tried making peace with them? Friends? That&#39;s the only thing I will say about that. So do you have any OTHER questions?&#34; His face was full of stoic determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did SHE have others?&#34; I knew that she did but I wanted to see if he was sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry dude. This island may love gossip, but many of us HATE it. This is something for you to discuss with YOUR mate and if you want my advice, I recommend that you don&#39;t start fishing for information that she would give you if you just ask her. Don&#39;t get caught up on bad habits. I assure you, she&#39;s not a fan of gossip either, asking questions about someone you love behind her back is not only disrespectful, but it would be hurtful to her. How would you feel if she went asking questions about your past behind your back? I don&#39;t want an answer to any of my questions, go home and ask them to yourself and think about what I said. Jason has been adapting very well, he&#39;s a good lad. We are best protected against The Council together and Loiza and your pups need you.&#34; He asked the Priestess to open the portal. Friends? Shit! He&#39;s right, I would totally hate it if Izz started asking questions of that nature about me and after how she put Delilah in her place, I don&#39;t think she is the type to ask or care what happened before we were mated. I extended my hand to Víctor... &#34;Your right, could you please---&#34; He shook my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She won&#39;t hear it from me, you&#39;re a lucky man Kayden, you guys just have had bad luck, timing, whatever you want to call it, but we are working on getting you two as you should be. So focus on your pack, she told you that Blood Moon would be invited. She&#39;s afraid for you and your pack, she knows that what you did puts a target on your back and I know her well enough to know that Block or no, she&#39;s not going relax until you are all safe.&#34; He nodded towards the portal. And I left understanding why Izz named him to be one of her Betas... Loyalty is always hard to find.</p>
