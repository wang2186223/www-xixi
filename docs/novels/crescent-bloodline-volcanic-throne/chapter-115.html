                <p>&#34;Seriously?!&#34;--- Jason recorded my mate and her brother and his mate teaching the pups to swim, I don&#39;t know if The Osupa know or care for bathing suits, but I am getting Izz one that she can&#39;t live without! I get that nudity is very normal for them... But Marius saw Loiza naked and now Jason! I&#39;m going to have to gash the boy&#39;s eyes out! Jason is unmated and almost two years older than Izz!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry Boss! But The Lagoon is only accessable to the residents of The Fort! You should already know how The Osupa are! For them this is like being naked in their pool!&#34; So everyone who lives there has seen her?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many residents are there in that pack house Jason?!&#34; I know it&#39;s way more than a pack house, but how many?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know... I&#39;d say about over 400. Plus it&#39;s a public building, the living quarters are separate, but the ground floors and basements people come and go all day, there&#39;s an archaeological team working in The Catacombs right now.&#34; Over 400!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jason I want to know how many people see my mate naked daily?&#34; He just looks worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;JASON! I ORDER you to tell me, remember, I&#39;M still your Alpha!&#34; He sighs and drops his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, I&#39;m not disobeying... It&#39;s just you adapt to it... Their way of life makes more sense. You spend the day letting your wolf loose in the rain forest all morning, there are some awesome waterfalls you can only get to in wolf form. So you just find it and shift to enjoy it... Only The Osupa KNOW THEIR country better than anyone, and there&#39;s people already there, but they&#39;re naked too because to---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, yeah, the only way to get there is in wolf form!&#34; I say smacking my face. &#34;So basically EVERYONE&#39;S seen everyone&#39;s business at one point or another and not covering themselves at all?&#34; He answers gesturing BINGO. Arrrg! Ok, Kayden, relax, we knew about this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And since it&#39;s never cold and no one really mentions it, you kinda forget about it too! You just have to always remember where you left your keys and that system is being advanced to finger print and retina security, I&#39;m lucky to live at The Fort cuz you just come and go and if you want to lock your rooms you just use your ring. But with the new system no one will even have to worry about that, although to be honest, no one really locks their doors around here!&#34; And she said I was a prudish outsider! Of all of the things I&#39;ve learned about The Osupa, this feels so weird, yet it makes absolute sense. I am definitely going to have to get over this, and she definitely doesn&#39;t give a fuck who&#39;s seen her since she accepted this video be sent and there&#39;s other naked people without anybody caring, neither Urayoán or his mate seems to care either. But regardless, she looks so much better, I wanted her so badly, I wanted to smell my pups and have their scent near, it made me long to hold them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Felix of Lycan Blood came to talk terms he was accompanied by his son and daughter, the one he wanted me to marry. She&#39;s pretty enough, light brunette, very nice petit body, but she&#39;s no Loiza.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Endora has officially deemed this encounter as treasonous, we were in high alert although everything seemed very civil. We had lunch and suddenly Alpha Felix&#39;s daughter goes missing. I looked at Marcus and had a hunch, I get up as I try to read Felix&#39;s face. And just as I thought, she&#39;s naked in my bed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She throws her arms around me and whispers: &#34;Hello Alpha! I have heard so many interesting things about you.&#34; She says trying to gain access to my cock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take her wrists and shove them away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you should know that I am Marked and mated. Get dressed, get out, you&#39;re infecting my room with your scent!&#34; She looked shocked, how many times has she done this for her father to get what he wants? &#34;It does smell very particular in here...&#34; It was starting to get on my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I SAID GET OUT!&#34; She still didn&#39;t comply &#34;Awe c&#39;mon Alpha, I would love a taste of the 11 incher I keep hearing about, don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t tell if you don&#39;t!&#34; That was enough for me to grab her by the arm and take her to her father right then and there naked in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was this a bad joke?! You really think that this would be a way to manipulate me to your will?! I have already risen the alarm in my pack of your scent, if you&#39;re pack&#39;s scent is in MY territory again every single person with the scent will be eliminated, enjoy your time with The Council... Get OUT!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are a bold brat aren&#39;t you?!&#34; I am done with other pack drama and I&#39;m not wasting my breath in petty bullshit with this asshole. My hand changes to a claw and I just gnash that mother fucker&#39;s face and give him the biggest roar I have ever given anyone. I don&#39;t want to start shit with Lycan Blood over this so I&#39;m merely giving them a warning. Yet it was effective enough to make their whole entourage piss themselves... Onlookers started laughing their asses off!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I guess you could say I AM A BOLD brat, asshole! Any Lycan Blood in Blood Moon in my territory will be KOS and thank the Goddess I don&#39;t start this second! Now leave my territory and just some advice... Stop pimpin your daughter! Doesn&#39;t that gross you out you piece of shit?!&#34; Having a daughter myself now I just couldn&#39;t imagine doing that, seriously, what the hell?! Needless to say they left with their tails between their legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had fucked more than a few from outside our pack... Ugh! If she knew my size plenty outside or inside my pack could have given that information. After I kicked out Alpha Felix and his offspring out of my territory, I had Marcus and Avis round up every piece of ass I have had been involved with inside my pack and to take them to my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise there were more than I remembered. By the Goddess! I WAS a man whore! I punch my forehead while sitting down in the chair by my desk and look at each of them. Delilah for some reason feels emboldened enough to get closer and try to touch me... What is she thinking?! Wasn&#39;t being chastised and humiliated the way she was enough to make her understand? I knew she wasn&#39;t very smart but never thought she was outright dumb as fuck, just to think that my dick was ever inside her made me a little nauseous. I grabbed her wrist before her hand could touch me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; I say as calmly as I possibly can. Breathe Kayden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem quite stressed Alpha, I just thought you&#39;d like---&#34; Ugh! I just feel embarrassed... What was I thinking?! I even considered making her Luna once!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You though wrong, go back with the others!&#34; When I saw that she just stood there my patience started to wean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NOW!&#34; That was enough to make her understand and joined the others. I hope she finds her true mate soon so she can get her notions of me out of her head. I address the other 22 women before me. For fucks sake 22! And that&#39;s just my pack alone. I&#39;m basically doing the biggest &#39;walk of shame&#39; ever.</p>
