                <p>Yaya&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s not waste anymore time, go now and be careful, we don&#39;t know yet if The Council has already infiltrated Karaya and it&#39;s a small island but 55 x 35 miles is still a lot of ground to cover so go with care and may the Goddess guide you. OPIA will keep track by satellite to make sure we have eyes on you at all times.&#34; Izzy is doing better that even I could have imagined. The girl has always had a firm head and a quick study with equally quick wits, I will see to it that she is High Priestess before the year&#39;s end she has always had the drive and ability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director keep on the search for the rest of our people, if they have assignments that can be postponed please tell them to meet the fleet at the Rendezvous point, I want to make sure that every single member of our pact is accounted for. I don&#39;t want any single one to be out alone in the open, however, is their retreat signifies any type of danger to themselves or to any mission they are in, they are to continue. Just reassure them that if they wish to return they can do so without fear of any dishonor. To be honest I&#39;d rather have the pack regroup. With the Priestesses rehabilitating Karaya and the threat of The Council looming we will need as many Osupa defending Karaya from another attack or posible invasion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Gloria bows with a heart fist salute, last they spoke they where in a shouting match because Iza got tired of the constant travel of either spying or serving as ambassador. The girl is 19 but everyone seems to forget that. Even I know it was unfair to name her Alpha, but she is the only one I trust and hasn&#39;t failed yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We leave the tent and I see Izzy look towards the pack house, I know she is worried of the answers she might find tonight talking to her mate. We don&#39;t have a pack house in Karaya, since we have been defending ourselves from posible sea invaders for centuries, we took the design the Spaniards for their forts and the Cacique&#39;s home is called The Cacique&#39;s Fort in the South West side of the island. For the first few years of us taking Karaya as our own, it housed every wolf, little over a thousand. Then we built a city around it and kept expanding, the island has land to house at least a million people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go to the medic tent, I wish to see how Maco&#39;s mate is doing, as long as she is in that condition I won&#39;t be able to count fully on him, and I really could use his help right now.&#34; We head in that direction and see Cresta coming over in black robes and cloak as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw you earlier in your favorite electric green cloak Cresta, what happened? Got into a darker mood?&#34; Cresta, Izzy and Ayana are good girls... until they are together. Then they make sure to keep you on your toes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh lookie, Yaya grew a sence of humor! How ever will I stop laughing! Nice try old woman!&#34; And she, Izzy and Bayoán start laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cressy! C&#39;mon you know Yaya sucks at getting a punchline!&#34; And they laugh again...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you two are just too hysterical for me.&#34; They are young, no need to take their humor to escape all this uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yaya, I just want to show respect, the Osupa are in mourning.&#34; She says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re not Osupa!&#34; Bayoán retorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure are still a buzz kill Bayo, well that&#39;s one of the reasons I am here... Izzy are you going to grant Ayana residency? Because I want in too!&#34; What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I am considering it, I talked to Bayo and we are in agreement that we want all temples and shrines to have a Guardian. I was thinking of giving the Cardinal Western Temple to Ayana, but if you want to move I can grant you that one and give the Cardinal Northern Temple to her. There is barely anyone living in that part of the island and Ayana can always portal herself anywhere, how does that sound?&#34; Is she going to do this without the authority of Moira?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds like a plan, we can ask for a transfer tonight before the ceremony! But I came because the others are investigating the territory for another unicorn and there was a boy in the dungeons who has info.&#34; By the Goddess!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is another unicorn these monsters took?!&#34; I say outraged. There will be a reckoning for this! And Izzy stops in her tracks and her face gets dark, and takes a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be fair Yaya, we are all monsters here. I will have to ask to go to Hades torture chamber in a month or two and see how their souls are. This is madness! Where is the boy?&#34; She asks now with her Mark shining yellow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s in the medic tent and I saw you guys headed there so I tagged along.&#34; We reach the medic tent and Iza tells Bayoán to check on the boy while we check on Maco&#39;s mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ana what is her condition?&#34; Iza asks Anacaona. And because of the girls efforts to tidy her up, we can at least see what she really looks like. She is fair of skin with deep wavy auburn hair, it looks like the girls had to cut some off and she has a very cute bob now. She still is covered in scars but they are less. She is a very pretty girl with a button nose and small lips and she seems as tall as Morgana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Alpha, it&#39;s definitely improving! Her femur is fully healed! Her body definitely knows how to heal itself properly like a true Omega. She won&#39;t have to feel that intense pain when she wakes! She also had a broken wrist which I imagined was from being pulled but her body took care of that as well. All in all she is definitely improving!&#34; Ana opens one of her eyes to verify her pupil dilation and and shows us a pretty teal eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh she has beautiful eyes!&#34; Cresta states.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It gets better!&#34; Ana says and opens her other eye and its yellow!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heterochromia! Oh my Goddess, Maco is going to flip! She is gorgeous! How long do you think it will take her to wake?&#34; Izzy asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s still hard to say Alpha, but there is definitely progress and I am very satisfied with it, it&#39;s more than I could have imagined and I suspect that your potion had something to do with that as well, but as an Omega her body definitely does know what to do and how to heal without having to turn into her wolf form. I have hope that by tomorrow she might start stirring.&#34; Iza sighs but has a smile, and I can tell she is hopeful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, Ana if you want to take a break go ahead and put somebody else to watch over her, I imagine you must be tired and would like to rest before tonight&#39;s ceremony.&#34; Iza says looking at our Jane Doe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Alpha, I will leave my Apprentice Kiki whom just started her shift. I definitely need some shut-eye.&#34; And she calls for Kiki and gives her instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cressy, can you please get her a linen chamise so that if she does wake up she doesn&#39;t feel so awkward underneath her covers? Not being Osupa and not knowing what she has been through I don&#39;t want her to feel any shame when she wakes up.&#34; And Iza is examining a particular star shaped scar in the inside of her left hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure! I&#39;m on it.&#34; And she leaves the tent while Kiki is verifying her vitals with regards to her chart making sure to know where she is at the moment she has taken responsibility. And we go to check on the boy, who on closer inspection is not a kid like I thought, but a young man with chestnut hair and hazel eyes. He is sitting in the cot talking with Bayoán, and must be around 6&#39;1&#34; but is thin and pale due to malnutrition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, this is Jacob and he was in Blue Moon but was sold to someone here.&#34; Monsters!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Jacob, how are you feeling?&#34; Morgana stands up so that Iza can take her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re an Alpha?!&#34; Jacob asks wide eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but not of this pack.&#34; She answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, your Beta told me you are from The Caribbean. Are you going back? Can I go with you? Marius is bat shit crazy!&#34; Poor boy seems to be traumatized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see why not, but we need your help Jacob, we know that you know where there is a unicorn. Can you tell us where he or she is?&#34; And he lowers his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, I am sorry, but he died about a month ago, things in Blue Moon are really bad.&#34; I can&#39;t help but gasp and beg for the Goddesses&#39;s mercy. Both Iza and Bayo take a deep breath and Morgana can&#39;t help but cover her mouth. Cresta joins us and her werejaguar ears heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know where the body is?&#34; Cresta asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No idea, they drained him but I was chained to be sold to Theo and his cronies for a hunt. They usually just throw the bodies in a pit about 4 miles south of the pack house.&#34; He says pity fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, a hunt?&#34; Morgana interjects. And we look back at Jacob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, they have this sick game of starving someone so they are weak, sell them to the other pack and hunt them down in Blue Moon territory and then throw the cadaver in the pit. Been going on for over 2 years now. I didn&#39;t think they would pick me because I&#39;m a Delta, and yet here I am.&#34; Oh my Goddess! And everyone gasps now. Iza gives a loud roar that I think shakes even the pack house, and leaves us all shaking likes leaves, even Bayoán!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cresta, tell the others. Find that pit and see if they can find the body. I want the most powerful Priestesses to storm that pack and unleash HELL! I want EVERY prisoner they have, try not to kill anyone, Selene doesn&#39;t want them in her realm, but I know the girls can bring them terror beyond death!&#34; Iza is standing and is livid. Her eyes are gold and her claws and fangs are extended. She wants blood, but I think that what angers her the most is that she can&#39;t partake. This is a matter for Avalon and the Goddess has commanded death by the Sword of Peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Definitely Izz, it&#39;s going to be fun as fuck to fuck those mother fuckers up!&#34; And her eyes are glowing and she bolts out of the tent. Izzy&#39;s Mark is bright yellow trying to calm down and I activate mine to help her, myself and everyone there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me Jacob, do you see that girl over there?&#34; And she points towards Maco&#39;s mate. &#34;By any chance, do you know her?&#34; Jacob looks over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah! That&#39;s Amelia, she&#39;s the pack doctor! She went missing months ago!&#34; Amelia, Thank the Goddess we have a name.</p>
