                <p>Isla&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I will never have grandchildren of my blood. It has taken me quite a while to come to terms with the fact that both my mate and my my son were gone, they took everything from me that day. When they told me they had identified their remains I insisted on seeing them, I needed to see for myself. They were just charred bones, but I still got their scent and their DNA matched, we all have our blood drawn at birth for the our records, it&#39;s how we first determine where we are in the Greek Alphabet coding system and to verify any particulars that future medical care they might need to improve healing to anything they might need. Yet my two milk daughters were alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They may not be of my body, but my milk fed both, I had three babies at my breast for a year... Natalia loves her birth mother, as was so for Loiza with her mother, but they have always called me Mamá and neither has treated me less than they have their birth mothers. There is a special Bond that is born when you breast feed a baby and both Ayiti and Kiskeya became the sisters I never had, fertility has always been hard in my mother&#39;s side and Ayiti and Phoebe explained that I was a blood descendant of The Great Mother herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why your touch on Iza&#39;s Mark was able to shut down her mind. The Mark was given to her by Gaia and since the Goddesses blood flows through you it deactivated it.&#34; When I asked if I indeed was who they said, why was it so hard for me to conceive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Replicating the genome for a god is difficult Luna.&#34; Phoebe told me. I didn&#39;t know if to feel honored or to curse my blood. I visited the Shrines for answers, but as I was sitting in between the them at the gardens crying I felt Gaia&#39;s comfort, not that I heard her like what Izzy describes, just a sense of reinforcement that my motherhood days were not over. That both Izzy and Talia were indeed my daughters, that just as their mothers body gave them life, it was my milk that sustained them. And now my arms indeed carried MY grandchildren, BOTH Alphas no less!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re so cute! Usually new born pups look like weird raisins but damn! These look like they&#39;re about a week old, and the girl! Her skin is like porcelain, she even has this dewey soft look--&#34; My sweet Talia has always had a voice that refuses to hush!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;TALIA! By the Goddesses mercy! Will you please stop! They are sleeping!&#34; Ayiti whisper shouted at Natalia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Izzy named them yet?&#34; Nía picked the boy with skill and no fear, she really has been practicing. Lola, Freya and Nina were looking but had no intention of touching them, yet Ura took the girl without a hitch. He used to help a lot when Izzy and Suania were babies and the usual lone wolf would always have a knack and patience with kids! I could see Freya loving watching him and was registering everything from their particular bond and making annotations on her phone, their own pup had a couple of months to go, but she has already confessed that her own upbringing made her unsure about her capabilities. Urayoán was showing her that there was nothing to fear and sat next to her to help encourage her, she will grow bolder eventually, but knowing her mate wasn&#39;t afraid was putting her mind at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nia made Nasser sit and handed her nervous mate the baby sitting next to him. He had already held his nephew Yuquibo, but that took him a week and soon he would have another by Yahir and Lucìa whom had a successful Heat. It would be soon until Suania&#39;s Heat kicked in and she wanted her mate prepared! She usually doesn&#39;t ask ,she just makes you do what she says and doesn&#39;t expect push back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, everybody out, I have to wake The Alpha, she needs to nurse these pups, take a shower, have a good dinner and keep resting, until it&#39;s time to feed these two again. It&#39;s going to be her first night as a mother and it&#39;s usually a little scary.&#34; They put the babies in their bassinets and leave me with Ayiti. I link Daniella and Alberto for the food we had determined best for now, she needed more protein and fats for her milk. We&#39;re feeding Alphas here and their little bodies demand it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wake Loiza. &#34;Mija how do you feel? Did you rest well?&#34; She&#39;s wiping the sleep from her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my Goddess, that has to be the best sleep I have had in my live!&#34; And she still hasn&#39;t slept holding her mate! It always angered me how this was allowed! And from the news that are reaching my ears, the boy is not the villain they have made him out to be. He doesn&#39;t even have a Block of any kind, his mind must be a mess right now not understanding why his mate is an emotional wreck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look mija, the pups are fine!&#34; I point to the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I can smell that EVERYONE has touched them.&#34; Not true!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza your exaggerating, now get up! I&#39;m going to help you shower and have dinner, the pups have been angelitos but they&#39;re going to wake up soon and demand food, so shower!&#34; She&#39;s still a bit sore, but she should be like new by tomorrow night or the next morning. I help her to the living room were the pups are and some almost rare steak with congri rice and lentil soup on the side and some ajonjolí juice to help with her milk are waiting for her. And she inhales it, she did want more lentil soup and juice, she also asked for morcilla, blood sausage, her body was begging for protein and iron, so morcilla was brought up and just as she finished the babies were waking. And the boy demanded to be fed. Loiza picked him like nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ayiti, stay with Izzy while I shower and get in my sleeping gown. I&#39;m sleeping with her and the pups tonight, their scent will help Izzy keep resting and healing.&#34; Izzy looked at me with that face of hers that is saying thanks a million times!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mamá, I--&#34; Hush!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are mis nietos mija! And you will always be my daughter, so enough of this I&#39;ll be right back!&#34; I go shower and brush my teeth and have the Hayan drops Daniella left me for Izzy. By the time I&#39;m there the pups drank Izzy up, good appetites! For the next month izzy is going to be using massive amounts of protein and carbs to make her metabolize that milk as fast as possible, so she needs to consume double that to produce the perfect amount of milk for the two baby Alphas. She NEEDS her mate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike humans, we must eat heavy amounts of this to loose the baby fat as fast as possible and regain our pre baby bodies to have once more the strength and agility to protect our offspring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok mija, Estefanía will link me every two hours so you can feed the pups, if you feel anything particular to eat there are apprentices in the kitchens standing by. Here take two drops, the important part is that you go into deep sleep and be fully healed fast.&#34; She takes the drops and puts the bottle on her nigh table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy mija, have you chosen names for these two? Not that there&#39;s any hurry.&#34; I know she really was waiting to meet them to name them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have Mamá, they shall be Deacon and Jade.&#34; Well that was unexpected, I had thought she would choose more traditional names but she decided to honor their father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deacon is your mates wolf, right?&#34; She nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could tell that he wanted me to know the truth of everything. Aryn even told me he was silent to Kayden before because of his ways and wanted to do his best to love and protect me as a true mate. So the honor of his name goes to my son, hoping that he will have the courage, honor and devotion of his father&#39;s wolf. Jade is also Alpha and carries the eyes of her father, like Deacon. Yet her eyes carry the beauty of them that makes me love him, the part that makes me hope. They both shall carry the Mirabal name with the Black hyphenated, they are heirs to the Mirabal Dynasty, not his. They are the future of The Osupa, not Blood Moon, period.&#34; Well once she was like this, there was no changing her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Deacon, Alpha Jade? I guess it works either way.&#34; I say as I see her eyes closing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden...&#34; She says as sleep takes her again, she will feel better tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**So you have decided to honor him in the names of the babes.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great... &#34;Yeah, I did. It felt right, I still can change my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**But why? Your choice is correct. Loiza you know deep down he truly didn&#39;t betray you. He is going mad right now not understanding why he is getting these emotions from you, this is cruel. You have a powerful Block and a spy inside to know that he is fine--**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That spy is making sure his witch is not there to betray him and is training his first line of defense by my order as a gift to ensure their survival! I have made sure that he learns every tactic available to me to increase his skills. I am passed the sins of his parents, but trust goes both ways. And if he doesn&#39;t want a Block, that&#39;s his prerogative, I don&#39;t have time to deal with HIS feelings. You have placed a task on my shoulders and I have accepted it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**It would be simpler if he was here to help you, I mated BOTH of you to carry this burden together. It won&#39;t get easier.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then make him learn faster! As he is right now, he still would slow me down, so help him more, I need real rest Great Mother, I really don&#39;t want to think about Kayden now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Your body will be fully restored by first light, as it should have if you would have had your mate with you by marking you again giving you his strength and assuring you of your Bond.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, good night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to many doubts as I peel apart what I saw in Kayden&#39;s mind that night, and the more I realize that he had just found out the truth of everything but was afraid of me thinking he was a part of if. No wonder Marcus though they were cursed! I wake up suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isla is sleeping soundly, she made a little &#39;nest&#39; between us with heavy pillows for the babies who were both looking with their huge jade eyes, they don&#39;t look like they were just born yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you guys hungry already? C&#39;mon!&#34; I take Jade and put her in place and she&#39;s latched on. &#34;Ok Deacon, I only have one arm for you, so cut me some slack ok?&#34; He was a perfect gentleman and latched on as well. I felt so calm with them looking at me with his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I start singing &#34;Tu Rumba&#34; by the gifted Kappa, Ilé and think it&#39;s a beautiful lullaby:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo no sé si es el rabito de tus ojos</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Que está buscando encontrarse con los míos</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pero, siento que hay un algo tuyo que me llama</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Entre medio de tanto gentío</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yo no sé si tu silencio me está hablando</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yo no sé si nos habremos conocido</p>
                
                
                
                <p>O si es mi locura que anda delirando</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Y que al final soy sólo yo que lo imagino</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hermosura que sale de ti</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Va flotando hasta llegar a mí...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Isla is getting Estefanía&#39;s notification, the pups were already full and falling asleep again in their little nest. I had my head laying on one of the pillows looking into Jade as her brother is falling asleep and I do notice that her skin has a pearl like shine to it. I looked at Deacon, his is not so noticeable but it was still there, only his has more of a golden tone to it just as his skin, it was so much like Kayden&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t say anything, I know Isla&#39;s eyes never miss anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalia was mentioning that particular glow to her skin, I just noticed Deacon&#39;s now.&#34; She said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you suppose it is?&#34; I don&#39;t see it as harmful, just curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None of their tests showed any irregularities, but they were Blessed by The Mermaid Queen who helped deliver them and the first person to hold Jade was a mermaid... Were they awake?&#34; It makes sense, I will have to ask Pasha about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, they both were.&#34; She links Estefanía with this information. She&#39;ll wake up every hour to check, they might need more milk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be checking every hour mija, focus on resting.&#34; Yeah, I don&#39;t want to remember the things that will be coming next.</p>
