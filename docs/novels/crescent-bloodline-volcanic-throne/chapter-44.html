                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To say that I am on edge is an  understatement. I gave an order but can&#39;t even partake in it&#39;s execution, damn it! So now I have to wait not only to know what happened in Karaya, but in Blue Moon, too. Before Cresta left I ordered for the vile Alpha Marius to be brought before me so that Moira look into him and impart judgment. A unicorn is a creature that helps keep the Earth in balance... It&#39;s magic works directly with the power of the Moon to serve as a Ying Yang conduit... That&#39;s why they are so precious to Selene. The blood of a unicorn has particular properties, and it&#39;s the most powerful to procure a proper spell with Blood Magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put those thoughts aside and focus on the here and now. I had those who were unconscious prisoners that Kayden sent to their Medical Ward be brought here. Along with the only TWO doctors they have! I still can&#39;t believe they only have two, they HAVE more Omegas, Chis and Phis. Unfortunately it&#39;s like with every other pack I have visited... they are like social misfits in their own pack, their talents relegated to servants and cleaners! Absurd!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many of the treated patients are begging to join our pack, not just Jacob and I will grant that... they are under my protection now.  Cleo comes over with her report... She bows and I am so done with all this protocol!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cleo! Don&#39;t, no one is around right now, can you NOT do that PLEASE! We have been sparring buddies and friends for enough time girl.&#34; And she laughs and smacks my hip to give her some space to sit on the cot next to me while I watch over Amelia for a bit. Now that we have a name I can give Maco SOMETHING. I move my ass so she can sit with me, besides Aya and Cressy, Cleo has always been one of my best friends... I used to have the biggest crush on her brother Casimar, now Admiral Casimar. I mean, how can I not! The classic tall, dark and handsome troupe fits him like a glove... and he does have those mythical yellow eyes like his father and his uncle, Braka. But the disappointed of what happened... Sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look so serious and everyone is so formal around you, so give me a break Izzy... to tell you the truth, it&#39;s weird as fuck!&#34; She says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, no shit! Do you think I WANT this?&#34; How am I going to keep Kayden by MY side, and not the other way around. I have no idea how to approach this with him... Besides the other dozen things. I thought I would find joy when I found my mate, not more complications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No bitch, I don&#39;t, but I can tell you ARE enjoying some of the perks! A little bird told me you thrashed the Lady Moira...that must have felt pretty good.&#34; Great... The thing I hate about my pack is &#39;los chismes!&#39; For a pack of expert spies, we are HUGE gossips... everyone knows EVERYONE&#39;S SHIT!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thrashing is hardly the word, but she did get a piece of my mind...and yeah it did feel good!&#34; And we let out a giggle that I really needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, either way Izz, I&#39;m with you girl! I KNOW you are going to kill at this!&#34; Choice words...but she leans on me as comfort. I lean back, she is taller than me so I can place my head on her shoulder and her scent was comforting. Well everyone in the Reyes family were among the tallest and mightiest of the pack, they ARE a legacy Alpha family after all. When we started training together I just arrived from Avalon and still wasn&#39;t really talking to anybody, Cleo was very accepting towards this, she wasn&#39;t much of a talker back then either, she isn&#39;t one still. But she does have a group of people that she does become a little Chatterbox! Not like Natalia, but when THEY get together, uff!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what about the humans?&#34; I finally ask her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost all have been sent to human hospitals far away after taking Forgetting potion, I didn&#39;t want to bring attention to this area... most were traumatized about being abducted, used and raped by werewolves. Two, however don&#39;t want to go back because of what you said, they were already running from abuse.&#34; Yeah, I don&#39;t want to imagine going through that and my eyes go to Amelia. By the Goddess, what did they do to her?! Freya escaped before being raped,  I shudder to imagine what happened to Amelia. And they start bringing in the patients and the two freaking doctors of Blood Moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob was lying down and suddenly he got up to look among the patients.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Jacob, what&#39;s up man?!&#34; Bayoán asks as he walks in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jacob pays no attention and heads towards what looks like an elf girl, but the dark lavender color of her short pixie cut hair and very pale yellow cat eyes indicates fae. Elves have &#39;traditional&#39; color hair, she has all the features of an elf, tall, gracefull, elegant, with pointed ears but the colours of fae folk. She starts going to him...mates! They reach eachother and look at eachother&#39;s condition,  and they embrace crying, like knowing the pain the other went through. Bayoán slaps his shoulder in congratulations and I go to them to show my happiness for them and meet this girl, who if Jacob becomes a part of the pack she will be welcomed as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations to both of you! What&#39;s your name dear?&#34; And they are whipping tears. The Osupa don&#39;t mind crying, it&#39;s not like we all don&#39;t do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A Priestess! My Lady my name is Phoebe, thank you for your help!&#34; And I feel that she is much more than a mere hybrid. So I test her. And before Bayoán and Cleo correct her...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Phoebe I am a Priestess...&#34; And I wait. Her eyes turn from pale yellow to red. And she takes a knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Alpha, I thought you a mere Priestess!&#34; And while I smile Cleo, Bayo and Jacob are stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arise Phoebe, you don&#39;t have to kneel to me! You are part Knowing Faery right?&#34; And Jacob looks at her with surprise and even more love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Alpha! You are knowledgeable of the fae folk!&#34; She says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I DID grow up with many fae folk and my mentor, the Lady Moira is elven. But there is MORE to you...you are no ordinary Truth Seer am I right?&#34; And the others look to her. And she is at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You KNOW?!&#34; I give her a wide smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I met your kin, Altheia once in Avalon, I can smell the scent of her blood in yours!&#34; Altheia is the fucking Faery of Revelation, who has the power to uncover the nature of life by pulling the world of illusion to reveal ANY hidden truth! They even call her The Destroyer of Illusion. But Phoebe looks away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has rejected me... they all have. There&#39;s no place for a mutt like me with the Noble elves or the Seelie Court. After my mother was murdered I had nowhere.&#34; And Jacob takes her in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No babe, we have a place! Right Alpha? If I join you Phoebe has sanctuary, right?&#34; I smile at them. The elves and the fae of The Seelie Court have always been the mayor snobs of the Supernatural world, they fucking think they are better than anyone. And Truth Seers are treasured among my people!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about it Phoebe? Would you like to join your mate with us?&#34; And she looks at Jacob and then at me again, while Jacob kisses her temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? I am welcomed?&#34; And Jacob tightens his grip for her in his arms, Bayoán already told him how our pack works and he was on board...the devotion he is showing his mate let&#39;s me know he will be a perfect fit with our people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jacob will soon take our Oath, as his mate so can you and be Osupa... You will understand what that means when you take the Oath as well.&#34; And she is teary again, Goddess only knows what this girl has gone through...she seems of similar age to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Are we leaving soon? I loathe this place! That bitch Vanessa had me chained in irons making me pathetic and weak! I couldn&#39;t even go invisible!&#34; Whoa! I did NOT see that one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe, you can go invisible?!&#34; And she blushes, and Jacob looks at her like she is a meal, salivating and all!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That IS a great Blessing indeed! I will have one of the tents ready for you both, so you can have some privacy and discuss your choice. However you are both recovering so I want to see a discharge from your doctors before you go. I am thinking we can have a ceremony tomorrow morning for everyone who wants to join our pack.&#34; Before the execution of the slavers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you taking every stray sister? Some are not werewolves!&#34; Bayoán just can&#39;t fucking help himself. My intuition tells me to take them ALL...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup! Glad I don&#39;t have to explain myself Bayo!&#34; And he doesn&#39;t look very happy at this. &#39;Are you mad?! Are you going to take the vampire, too?! His clan doesn&#39;t want him! And what about those the Priestesses bring after the raid on Blue Moon?!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You worry too much my dear Beta! We have Phoebe with us now! Her, Morgana and the other Truth Seers will be able to tell if there are any spies or outliers that wish us harm. If the person wants to come I WILL allow it... do I make myself CLEAR?!&#34; And yes, I am using my Alpha voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crystal Alpha!&#34; And he can&#39;t avoid to shake his head and smile. &#34;Your backbone is turning to steel sister...&#34; &#39;Father would be very impressed.&#39; And I smile back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha I will be happy to help! You speak truthfully, I will help you make sure nobody who is unworthy of your sanctuary to be able to come! I give you my word!&#34; I learned long ago to NEVER thank ANY fae unless you want to wake up a Thousand Years Later dancing at the foot of an oak tree!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate your words Phoebe, your help will be most welcome!&#34; And a gust of wind hits us. The vampire Orwell of the Vanishing Clan comes towards me. Taking a knee like Phoebe before. Good thing we had the formula and ingredients to make a Taicaraya IV drip...it will protect him from his Vitamin D allergy for a month! If he goes to get one every month, he will be able to walk in the sun always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, I heard what you said. This girl, Phoebe, will read me, I have no place as well and I am tired of wondering the Earth with no destination. If you accept me I will swear you my life and my 152 years of experience for council, as well as every gift I have at the beck and call of the Osupa, my new clan.&#34; He stays on his knees. Vampires and our kind have never been allies, on the contrary, to our people, to see a vampire means to kill on sight. But I have worked with vampires when I was in Avalon, and we were never enemies there. Those methods are antiquated and obsolete, vampires are Mighty Warriors with amazing abilities. So to have one in our pack would be a great asset, and I look at Phoebe for confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He speaks truth Alpha, he truly wishes to set roots and be still, he has wondered for quite a while and is worried because of this new problem of being captured by werewolves. His clan didn&#39;t want him then because of his neutrality, and now that he has been a slave to werewolves they want him even less.&#34; I am starting to like Phoebe more and more, she not only is the Truth Seer, she is also a Reader! And I don&#39;t think she realizes it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it is settled Orwell, you will be part of our pack tomorrow morning, I would like to ask favor if you do not mind?&#34; I signal with my hands for him to stand up, I don&#39;t think I will ever get used to all of these new formalities... I never got used to the formalities when I was just a Priestess!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything Alpha.&#34; This is right, I can feel it in my intuition, in my bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you are fully physically healed, can you please go to every single other victim and ask which one would like to join us, too? Also when the Priestesses come from Blue Moon, I will need to know which ones would like to join us as well. Can you verify that information and bring them to any of our Truth Seers to verify that they are appropriate candidates?&#34; Vampires have extremely sharp memory and are agile and fast, this should be a piece of cake for him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will be as you command Alpha!&#34; I tell Cleo to please make sure that he is bathed and dressed appropriately, poor man was in rags, I want him to look approachable. And that is how Orwell became the first vampire of the Osupa pack.</p>
