                <p>Guanina&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It has been three days since Izzy is an emotionless robot. Last time I had a meeting with Bayoán I wanted to stab him in his jugular, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time I have had that want... When I went to check if she liked her room as it was she looked confused, she just said that it&#39;s to big. Izzy LOVES the ocean, of all of us I&#39;ve always thought that she has always had a strange relationship with it... So she would spend her nights in the balcony listening to the ocean and playing casually with the fire of the fire pit and her days in The Catacombs demanding to be alone. When Maddame Le Blanche came to take her measurements to prepare a wardrobe for her, she would not get feedback from Izzy, and said she would return when she was feeling ok again. One night I went to her usual place in the balcony with Ura, weed and beer to talk smack trying to rekindle The Circle, she ORDERED us with her Alpha voice to leave her the fuck alone in the most monotone way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotions or no that&#39;s not like her, Ura wanted to tell her that Freya was pregnant. Izzy has always been the apple of Urayoán&#39;s eye, so he went to Bayoán to demand that the block be taken off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bitched about me being her Beta and that&#39;s part of the job, if that block goes down she will crumble especially now! So do your job and let me do mine!&#34; Ura took a swing at Bayoán but Bayoán caught the incoming punch and rapidly punched Ura back landing it straight to his jaw cracking it. Suania was there and started crying. Bayoán is an asshole, but I know damn well that if he would have used all his strength Ura would be days in the hospital with half a face. And I noticed the amount of stress Bayoán was in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually everyone leaves when I get in a fight with him but this time I had to serve as peace keeper... I hate keeping the peace!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OK STOP IT! For fucks sake Izzy is counting on us to keep the pack functioning! Look at what she did for us and is this how we are repaying her?!&#34; I like getting on her nerves and pushing her buttons, but Izzy is an awesome sister and has proven she can easily lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t keep seeing her like that! She has even cut her link!&#34; Ura said with difficulty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayoán sat on the chair of his office which used to be father&#39;s, The Fort is not a pack house, it&#39;s what it&#39;s name implies, it&#39;s a  Fortress. And when our ancestors built it they constructed it so everyone could do their job individually and then meet in the Council Chamber to organize cohesively. It&#39;s always been a magnificent structure, the Kappas of those days used coral stone, granite and quartz, the materials available here and in neighboring islands to make it indestructible against attacks from both sea and land. And the design of the throne room was a dome that reflected the acoustics of the Alpha&#39;s voice and also serves as a shelter. They mixed what the Spaniards did, and added elements or Ancient Roman architecture and used the Golden Ratio to make it a genius of design, it&#39;s one of the first things studied in the Architectural School at the University.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you will have to endure it! Do you fucking think I like seeing my little sister like this Urayoán?! If Morgana takes down that block she is risking Izzy&#39;s sanity! Put yourself in HER shoes damn it! She&#39;s miles away from her mate, who&#39;s family almost destroyed us, she is a Priestess of Avalon! What she did is considered taboo to them, in their eyes it&#39;s the equivalent to us rejecting a mate, she went against what she knows to be right to get the information we needed to ensure our survival, knowing that there was a chance the she would lose her mate after fully bonded! I admit that I&#39;ve become a full blown asshole but you&#39;re being selfish! Do you really think that if that block goes down you will get your little sister back, especially in her condition?!&#34; Damn it, I HATE agreeing with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait what condition?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He takes a breath and pinches the bridge of his nose and looks at Ura: &#34;Your mate is not the only prego in the building, Izzy was in Heat when she mated with Kayden and from what Daniella says it&#39;s a double header.&#34; He stands from his desk and goes to a small fridge and grabs a bottle of vodka form the freezer and just takes a chug at it and puts on the desk for whomever wants some. Ura and I sit in the chairs in front of his desk I take a chug and pass it to Ura, but he doesn&#39;t want it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayoán it&#39;s only been DAYS!&#34; I don&#39;t know what else to say. For Twins Souls is absolutely understandable, from what I have been checking out they start their Heat at once, but an Alpha?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not a regular female werewolf Nina, she&#39;s an Alpha, her body will adapt to ensure an heir and accelerate the process.&#34; He REALLY looks stressed. Ok, I think I get what happened now... Is it because their BOTH Alphas?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does she know?&#34; I am lost for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... At least I don&#39;t think so... No one has told her, but you guys know her. As a Priestess I have a feeling she does.&#34; Izzy was trained in Avalon to know any changes in her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, wolves in the wild have their pups in two months, as we are also human that time is extended to a six month pregnancy, usually Alphas are male, if in days we know she&#39;s pregnant, how long until she&#39;s due?&#34; Is there precedence for this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t know, Daniella is looking in the old files trying to find how were Alpha Kiskeya&#39;s (our mother&#39;s namesake) pregnancies, she did have 8 pups if memory serves me right.&#34; He says rubbing his forehead. &#34;We have to digitalize those records.&#34; Then to Urayoán.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So now YOU tell me Ura, how is Freya coping with HER pregnancy? Morgana is a witch with a human pregnancy cycle and in her second trimester... She is driving me insane and she is just a witch that can control ONE element, but counts with the love and support of her mate doting on her and trying to make her laugh whenever possible. Freya has you loving her and comforting her as her Twin Soul, when her hormones kick in she has her mate to cuddle, reassure her that she is loved by him and telling her that she is still the beautiful woman that he loves... We can give Izzy our love and support and shower her with everything we can give her, but she isn&#39;t getting that from her MATE, the other part of her soul is far away and persona non grata to her. Now you tell me brother, what do YOU think will happen if Morgana takes down that block? Why do you think Izzy herself commanded a PRIME PRIESTESS to guard her? Do you think the Lady Sumayah enjoys being a sentry to another Priestess? They consider themselves SISTERS! Sumayah and any Priestess considers this a betrayal to their sisters, she&#39;s doing it because Izzy herself asked for it to ensure our safety from herself.&#34; Ura&#39;s eyes go dim and reaches for the bottle taking a very deep chug at it and I extend my arm for it joining him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are dealing with a pregnant ALPHA, who can master ALL elements, doesn&#39;t have her mate and is waiting for all the findings of evidence from Avalon to make a formal war declaration to the fucking Werewolf Council! Have you ever really studied the teachings father gave us on warfare Ura? Izzy HAS and knows them by heart, I read her notes once when you and her were in Istanbul. Do you know what I saw? I saw a mind sharper than FATHER all over her notes. Let&#39;s just say that her mind is a sponge and she has been training since even before going to Avalon... Moira had already told father that Izzy would be going, so he taught both her and Yadiel about the basics, herbology, astronomy and basic combat. She was taught by Moira HERSELF, they don&#39;t just teach the ways of the Goddess in Avalon, they change their perspective to see what we CAN&#39;T, then she comes back and Dad puts her to train advanced combat with Braka with Cleo as sparing partner and he keeps teaching all the things he thought all of us, she trains at OPIA with Tia Ayiti reviewing all the stealth, speed and accuracy already taught to us by Mom, and to put the icing on the cake Yaya keeps teaching her to be High Priestess! THINK URA! What will happen if a pregnant Alpha with her power is released before the correct time from that which is binding her emotions?! And I suspect everyone has seen the new Mark she has? Well there is an entity who gave it to her, she was able to read and memorize the gibberish book, not even Moira can read it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ura can&#39;t or doesn&#39;t want to answer... But we all know what could happen, even Nia is silent and it&#39;s scary as fuck! I rub my face from the stress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, so what do you need from us and when does Morgana calculate the block will take hold just for Kayden and Izzy is Izzy again?&#34; Shit, these months are going to be painful for her and I have to contact Master Rafael to decorate a nursery, I love how he has decorated every room so far, I know Izzy enough to know that she will love her room when she is herself again and Luna Isla&#39;s room made her so happy despite her pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For starters you can all get out of my damn ass! I am dealing not just with Izzy, we have the refugees from Blue Moon, the escapees from Blood Moon and Oceania Luna and Lune Première are on their way, not to mention that the rest of OUR pack arrives in two days! Add to that, that we have another sibling in distress over his mate, Amelia is taking longer to wake, Anacaona fears she has deep trauma and her wolf has become overprotective... Thankfully Maco&#39;s lab and research for the termal suits for the Priestesses was intact and keeps him occupied, however he still goes everyday to the hospital to be near her so that Mero can soothe her wolf! Nina I know you are busy with what Izzy asked of you and I swear sister I AM trying to reach middle ground with you, but I have to take into account the resources we have and calculating what we will need when the new packs come. I know you want to build a Grand City in a week, right now that&#39;s impossible so please deal with the resources I can give you for now and still design whatever your heart&#39;s desire, we will get to it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ura I also know that you have your hands full with the hunters to supply food for everyone until the farmers can get everything back to normal with the help of Avalon, they are working with the engineers to make better systems of agriculture, we used to be over 10,800 before the volcano, we lost over 1,300, now add the numbers of those who came with us and the two extra packs. The block will do what it will and Izzy will be herself again, but the spell is recalibrating for TWO Alphas. That leaves only Suania helping take some of the burden of Maco and his mate, that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t let her join you with the hunters, SO WILL YOU ALL GIVE ME A DAMN BREAK?!&#34; Shiiiiit, I am so glad I am not a Beta.</p>
