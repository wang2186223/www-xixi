                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We hanged out for a little while longer after Paco finished my tattoos, for the Goddesses sake I hope this is ENOUGH! I always wanted to get tattoos but something nice and cohesive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I kicked everyone out, I had already given instructions to Monica to feed the pups my milk that is already stored for them. I go over to him and wrap my arms around his neck and he puts both his hands at my waist. We just look each other for a long while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was that all right? Or did I throw a lot at you? I really did not expect you to come so early. Are they airborne? is everything all right?&#34; He just stares at me smiling. I feel myself blushing terribly and try to remember my training. It&#39;s not working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wraps his arms around my waist and hugs me tightly kissing my temple... &#34;Are you kidding me? That was a special welcome Love, thank you!&#34; I kiss his jaw and before I take off my dress he stands back to look at me. I&#39;m still wearing the white robe I wore for the shrines this afternoon, ironically it&#39;s actually a very similar style to a what  Priestesses at Delphi wore. Only their robes usually tended to be pale yellow, and in special events, like when The Pythia or Oracle would channel a prophecy from Apollo would speak, then they would use the robes with heavier colors to emphasize the importance of the event. The darker the color of the robe would let on lookers know the importance since those dyes were not cheap, and if they wore purple... well, it meant you HAD to listen! In antiquity it took so much Carmine to make purple that I became a godly color. That&#39;s why it was the color the great Cesars of Rome would use to show their power, wealth and signaling their own closeness to the gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He goes and sits on the bed to observe me and I walk over to him putting his face in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this how you like to see me? As I was?&#34; He smiled. Putting his hands around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always ask me that question, and my answer is going to be the same... I&#39;d like to look at you anyway I can! Phi if Helios would not have been born I would have allowed the world to go in darkness to just take you away and find another realm for us. I&#39;m actually still thinking that&#39;s what we should do, leave them to this planet.&#34; I start tensing up. I&#39;m not a celestial being, I am of the waters of the planet of Gaia, he however is an astral being, a star. I don&#39;t know if I could leave this planet. He notices my distress and stands up and wraps his arms around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me Love, it was out of hand. I don&#39;t think Gaia would bind you to just her waters.&#34; I just let him hold me... I close my eyes, I don&#39;t want to think on this now. I wrap my arms around his chest taking in his scent. After a while he raised my face to see his own, he caressed my lips with his thumb and already I&#39;m feeling lost in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gives me that gentle smile he gave me since the first time we met. We are soaking each other up remembering... I put my hand to his cheek and he closes his eyes and pushes his face to my touch. Of all the gods who pursued me, it was his patience that won me over. He didn&#39;t take me like all the others would, we would sometimes sit in silence for hours, him playing his lyre, others we would have conversations that would last for days. I thought him the most beautiful of the gods, yet our love was built slowly, and one day I yearned for him so much that I decided I would be his come what may. After he stopped his carriage for that brief moment to see me, he came that night and took me away to a simple manor close to the ocean where he made love to me several times that night with the sound of the howls of his beloved wolves and the Aegean filling the darkness. It still gives me shivers...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile grows as he can see in my memories, how I&#39;m remembering everything. He takes off my robe and carries me to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you do the honors my beautiful water Nymph?&#34; I smile back at him as I filled the bathtub and he places me inside. He strips down and gets in with me and we are exactly in the same position we were when the daeva possessed him, I&#39;m so thankful that my Master was here. It would have gathered information and taken it directly to Poseidon, my Master sent him directly to be Cerberus&#39;s dinner. Hades had given him specific instructions that whatever the Goddess Phoebe sent him was to be destroyed immediately. He again goes for the oils but this time he finds immediately what he&#39;s looking for... Orange blossoms, my flower. And as he pours it on my neck and starts rubbing me all over I feel my scent change, the smell of pineapple and vanilla welcoming the scent of orange blossoms just like his scent added the sunflowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the lyre again filled my mind... He KNOWS my weakness so well and then he takes his lips to his Mark and lingers while cupping both my breasts. I lay my head back on his chest granting him more access, my fingers taking his thighs, I can already feel his want... My breasts show him mine. Yet his lips still linger at his Mark while his fingers are playing with my folds. I was in bliss, I wanted to feel like this forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His finger entered me gently... I was trying to hold my voice but he already knows what to do to get what he wants and a long moan left my lips. I don&#39;t know how long he had me like that, time had stopped. I notice that the only light now is of fire pit outside... It&#39;s roaring! I stand up and reach for his hand which he takes and lets me guide him outside. The night air is fresh and just cool enough. I Make him sit and I kneel before him...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lord, need you to control that fire otherwise you might damage something. I need that fire that I&#39;m seeing to be inside you and then release it to me do you remember Love?&#34; I was trying, she always guides me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you command My Lady...&#34; She was already testing that command as she started stroking me gazing at me, the fire reflecting on her own eyes turning them as fire as well. The fire in the pit grows and she stops. Fuck! Idiot, do you want to burn this entire island?! I breathe in and focus my fire back where she wants it... Inside my dick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the fire lowers I feel my need for her grow and she continues never breaking eye contact. I swallow hard, she&#39;s driving me to madness... She looks at the pit and sees that&#39;s contained, smiles and takes me in her mouth. I look up at the stars and take in their cosmic beauty and pass what I feel to her. She sits on me facing me with that gaze full of love that always filled my soul, my cock now surrounded by her softness, by her wetness, by her warmth. I can&#39;t help but give a low growl making me close my eyes for a moment as she moves her hips they way she knows I love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open my eyes, the fire was dim but steady, it was burning exactly where it had to and following my command. I pushed myself at her, her lose hair being played with by the wind. I don&#39;t think that the effect of Eros&#39;s arrow will ever subside, nor do I want it to. I still thank my nephew for it, he and Psyche are in truth the first mates, and I will always be grateful for him for sharing it with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know how much she loves ridding me, I want to take her but I love it when she takes me. I let her continue and bring her torso to mine and wrap my arms around her waist and burry my face in her breasts. Where the scent of our pups lingers filling my heart even more. Her moans, her scent, her softness... I can&#39;t hold myself and I roar releasing myself inside her and she releases her water. I claim her again and extend my canines and punch through my Mark again and she does the same... A do over. We stay like that for a bit I just want to keep holding her listening to her heart. She passes her fingers through my hair like she knows I love, her soothing healing fingers. All of these months in stress and agony, I finally feel like I can let go of all of it, she&#39;s finally in my arms again and I and hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kiss her deeply and take her in my arms as she balls herself in them and I take us inside the water again. After getting cleaned we just laid in the bed together, her in my arms as I always love it, we just listen to the waves and I play in our mind the tunes I know she loves. Where IS my lyre?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And suddenly the song of the little frogs they love so much sounds loudly making me jump a little and she laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s been out there for a few nights! I think he found a little mate in the plants of the balcony. It&#39;s usually very rare for them to be so close to ocean water. I just let them be, they lull me to sleep, they&#39;re native to the original island where my family came from. Although you can really hear them all over The Caribbean now. My ancestors held them in high reverence.&#34; I hold on to her tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really have come to love this land haven&#39;t you?&#34; I ask her looking through it through her memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! It is magical. I know you see it through my memory but wait till you actually taste it. The air in the mountains, in the rainforest, your wolf will go crazy in it! So many sounds and scents, so many rivers and lakes and then the ocean to swim in! And it&#39;s not just the island, they know how to live well. If we do this again, I want to come back here Love... I want us BOTH to come back here, do you think we can negotiate that?&#34; I would grant her every request if I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will negotiate with Gaia when our time comes, is that all right Love? I think I will come to love this place too.&#34; At the sound of her silence I look down and I noticed she&#39;s already asleep. I stay looking at her for a long time... Immortality... Why would I want it without her? I would do it all over again, it was the easiest choice I&#39;ve ever made...</p>
