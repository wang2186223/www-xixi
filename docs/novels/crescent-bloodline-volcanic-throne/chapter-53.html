                <p>I walk towards Kayden who is returning to the pack house with a grim face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened, did Diana&#39;s mate reject her?&#34; We walks pass me... &#34;Let&#39;s talk in my office get Avis and Gabriel.&#34; I link them both while following an aggravated Kayden. Once we reach the office...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on now? Did he reject her?&#34; He sits with a glass of whisky and takes a sip. He goes ahead and tells me what happened and I can read between the lines. Avis and Gabriel arrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you verify who is this Logan who WAS Diana&#39;s husband?&#34; Kayden&#39;s mood did a full on 180⁰ from the last time he saw his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Alpha! He usually patrols the southern border between the river and Blue Moon.&#34; Kayden links Logan to come here. &#34;After my conversation with Logan I will need you two to stand guard in front of the old Alpha and Luna&#39;s room. I want to know what their condition is and I want them monitored, they are forbidden from communicating with anyone and anyone who gives them the time to talk or write will loose their tongue and be banished, am I clear?!&#34; They both respond... &#34;Cristal Alpha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man I asume is Logan enters... &#34;Logan, right?&#34; Kayden just got to it... and he gestures Logan to sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan I have some news that might be painful so I wish to be the first in offer my sympathy, and want you to know that we are here for you as your pack.&#34; Usual condolences for someone who has lost a mate. Yet he looks confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Goddess Alpha did my mother die or something?!&#34; Kayden looked at him, his healing knuckles, his demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Logan, you&#39;re now ex-wife has gone to her true mate, he has forgiven and accepted her. Make sure to stay well away from them, the Osupa Alpha has already decreed a KOS (kill on sight) on you should you go to her.&#34; Kayden kept it short and bitter. Logan lost his shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY EX WIFE?! DIANA IS MINE!&#34; He shifts right there in the office and we run behind him. &#39;We need to catch him before he gets his exes scent mixed with her new true mate, their Alpha has already decreed death if he broke that rule! And we don&#39;t have the numbers to defend the idiot!&#39; Kayden says linking us while we shift jumping out of the pack house. &#39;Alpha isn&#39;t their Alpha our Luna? Would she kill people of her pack like that?!&#39; Avis just throws that out there. Ugh! I catch Diana&#39;s scent and Loiza&#39;s... Fuckingshitdamnit! &#39;Avis I&#39;ll explain if we fucking survive THIS, but so far what does the mate BOND of the Osupa look like to YOU?!&#39; Gabriel bites down on Logans ankle. &#39;It looks like a shit show to me Beta!&#39; Gabriel is able to hold him down. &#39;You&#39;re damn RIGHT!&#39; And we are mere two meters from Diana and Loiza!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Loiza just looks at the show... &#34;And here Diana dear, you&#39;ll probably understand what I mean when I say my wrath is a whole different thing entirely from an average Alpha.&#34; And both Loiza and Diana had pretty pleasant smiles...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all launch at Logan keeping him pinned and who I imagine is Arasibo comes behind Diana wrapping his arms around her waist licking his Mark. And I swear he is testing Logan, his adrenaline is pumping making him get stronger. Kayden gets up and orders Logan home with his Alpha voice. Everything happened so fast!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Logan I command you return home, cool down and accept what happened!&#34; He stands up shooting daggers at Diana&#39;s neck where the fresh mate Mark is... &#34;You go on and take my seconds pup! That bitch&#39;s womb is dry, just ash and dust like her pussy!&#34; Sibo, moves forward and when I see Loiza not stop him... &#34;Logan keep your mouth CLOSED, Avis, Gabriel, escort him home!&#34; It&#39;s getting harder for them, he is resisting Kayden&#39;s Alpha command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Loiza, please stop your man!&#34; Kayden pleads with her, and she gives us the coldest stare I&#39;ve ever seen, her eyes are gold and her canines are extending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gave a warning Alpha! What kind of Alpha would I be if I allow a warning to be challenged?! Do YOU allow YOUR warnings challenged Alpha? Do YOU Beta? I suggest you make way, Arasibo loves putting down Deltas who beat Omegas.&#34; She made a very important point, if she does lets this go, her reign, her rule, her every command could be challenged. She is even allowing the grieved party to fight for his mate and she is clearing the air that Diana&#39;s ex was a wife beater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right Loiza! But you said he was challenging you, shouldn&#39;t YOU be be the one who puts that challenge down?&#34; Kayden says. &#39;What the fuck are you thinking Kayden?&#39; He is silent for a moment... &#39;Logan dug his own grave, I just want to see how she shuts it down.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you would prefer for me to turn Logan here into dust versus allow him to try to fight for his honor? Is that your way? Then I shall comply... Sibo, go to your mate. Let this be a warning for whomever wishes to try to test my patience, my orders or my authority!&#34; Suddenly the ground opens just under Logan and he is pulled down with a piercing scream and the earth just closes again crushing Logan to dust. It just took an instant! We couldn&#39;t believe our eyes, and the Osupa present take a knee in reverence and start howling! &#39;Were you expecting her to shut it down like THAT?!&#39; I ask Kayden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;She is full of rage, I felt it in our Bond.&#39; He answers. &#39;So you&#39;re telling me you sacrificed a man to test her temper?&#39; Is he insane? &#39;No, I sacrificed a DEAD man to test her temper. She&#39;s been acting very different from this afternoon. I think you are right brother... I think she knows about Lydia. I will wash up and tell her everything after the ceremony.&#39; He dusts himself off. &#34;Avis, Gabriel, do what I ordered you to do!&#34; And they are both staring at the place in the ground where what is left of Logan&#39;s remains lie, which looks like it was undisturbed. &#34;GO!&#34; He shouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loiza&#39;s gaze is on him like a hawk, until she just walks towards where they have their ceremony set up. Kayden goes to the house and I follow, I have to shower again and I suddenly see The Osupa&#39;s Beta leaning on a nearby tree with a wicked smirk on his face. And he follows his sister... they do know!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach Kayden and I link: &#39;I think you&#39;re right, I think they know, shower and meet me here we must talk with them!&#39; He is very thoughtful... &#39;What am I going to say Marcus?! Can that Beta brain of yours come up with a good explanation?!&#39; I start hearing the drums in the distance, they have begun. &#39;I&#39;ll try to think of something, but try to find something through your mate Bond! I&#39;ll meet you here in 15 minutes.&#34; And I go clean all the Logan off of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only did he allow that pest to challenge my order, HE openly challenged ME!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy wait! We need to talk about what just happened...&#34; Great I don&#39;t need his shit right now! &#34;I know that your control level is at a minimum, but do you really think that was necessary?! A lot can happen between today and tomorrow. Kayden wasn&#39;t trying to challenge you, he was testing your temper. You&#39;re letting him know that we suspect him! Use your brain Loiza, with that control you won&#39;t be able to succeed in tomorrow&#39;s mission!&#34; The drums have begun, the pyre is lit, the chalice with the 13 livers ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yaya starts as Hight Priestess, she gives a recount of the history of our people... originally 13 small packs turned to five, until we united into one tribe and how in spite our losses, great Blessings shall come and I catch the scent of fresh rain and pines, so I try to focus... &#34;To this fire we bestow the hearts and brains of those hunted so that it&#39;s energy may liberate their mind and spirit, this chalice holds the livers of the hunted, we cast them also to the flames to purify any corruption from our people, so that we may heal with a clean wound.&#34; And with a clap of my hands the chalice starts burning almost white flames with blue tips...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moira and Cresta must be moving those from Blue Moon and those who still need more time to recover to Karaya if we are on schedule. Yaya continues the ceremony while I can&#39;t help but continue to watch the flames. Now that I know most of Karaya is intact I clearly remember watching the whole island go up in smoke... Was that glamour to make sure we didn&#39;t return? Not only were they, willing to kill us, they didn&#39;t want us back at all... The warriors didn&#39;t find The Council soldiers in Itiba City, they were invading through Uguaca Bay. Were they so sure that we would not return, and were having a tour? Did they know most our technology is in Itiba or was it a distraction? I link everything to Bayoán. I feel him look at me: &#39;Your part of the ceremony is done, follow me discreetly.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I feel Kayden is in the crowd looking for me...&#39; He starts smelling the air trying to find his scent, but I point out exactly where he is. Bayo takes my wrist and pulls me in a different direction in the crowd and we head towards Director Gloria&#39;s tent. I hear the sounds of the drums raising and the smell of the food and the mood of the people lighten while mine becomes darker. &#39;Bayoán, I am not feeling like myself or in any type of control! I want to do to someone else what I did to Sibo&#39;s opponent earlier again.&#39; Yeah I should be angry, but all I feel is rage and I feel I&#39;m loosing control over it, I feel my temperature rising by the time we reach Gloria&#39;s tent. I hear Bayoán link to Braka... &#39;General de need another perimeter around makeshift OPIA HQ.&#39; &#39;On it.&#39; Braka responds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy I don&#39;t think your body can wait till tomorrow, since you met Kayden your body has begun the procreation process. Not only is the Moon taking your control, it&#39;s making you more fierce and it&#39;s activating your Heat. Kayden already suspects that we know. Director what&#39;s your assessment?&#34; Gloria stands and puts her hand to my face feeling my temperature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her Heat is coming but not yet, not right now, how is this possible?! Anyway I recommend we stay on schedule, Alpha, no more jading potion, get Daniella in here! We need an alternative, but with the Moon full AND her Heat, her mate won&#39;t question anything, when the Moon raises tomorrow his Alpha blood will destroy this entire pack to get to her. So I suggest the Cacique be hidden away most of the day and be in full meditation, she will need to be as focused as possible...THIS won&#39;t do.&#34; Wonderful, I will be a sex crazed lunatic by this time tomorrow! I REALLY want this, I REALLY, REALLY want him but I have to focus on those 20 seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sister, we have more news.&#34; Ok? &#34;The mission in France was more of a success than we hoped for.&#34; This DOES interest me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Alpha Antoine agree to everything?&#34; And they both smile at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not only that, but their closest allies, Oceani Luna from Sardinia joined, both Alphas lay down their titles at your feet... That&#39;s over 8,000 more wolves added to our numbers... All have passed Umbros&#39; Truth Seers ability. Natalia already sent images of their living conditions and daily attacks, it has made them strong, but their mental state is being tested they are willing to give it up for peace.&#34; Peace?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do the KNOW we are heading for WAR?!&#34; And he takes my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They ARE! Antoine and Alpha Cesar are no fools sister, they are aware Avalon backs us, they prefer that than the war The Council is waging on them. Their enemies are backed by The Council.&#34; I think about this for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And no problems with a FEMALE Alpha? No &#39;special&#39; conditions I should know about?&#34; I usually know how these treaties go down, I ain&#39;t marrying anyone!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At first they did want a marriage contract until they saw a video of when the Goddess crowned you, which has gone viral in supernatural cicles, may I add... they let it go after that!&#34; Good!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And ALL passed Umbros questions?&#34; Bayo nods. I know Umbros doesn&#39;t leave out details, my cousin is a LOT like Maco and Bayo... he sees everything and likes to double check and Tía Ayiti trained them herself to ask the correct questions every time. He knows how to look into someone like Moira, if he says its clear, I trust it. As the drums keep sounding in the distance I give the order to allow BOTH Lune Premier and Oceani Luna to pack up and head to Karaya as I sign the digital contract.</p>
