                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am hungry all the time now, my bump is now as large as Morgana&#39;s who is still in second trimester. I am so done with this and am only halfway, I don&#39;t even want to imagine almost a year of this! They&#39;re kicking HARD. Every new member has opted to get the tattoo that repeals any entity from taking over your body and many have taken to the trend of having it on the right forearm, and the tattoo artists are making bank!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina and the Kappas (both old and new members alike) have finished the city in Uguaca Bay. We have come to the consensus to call it Atabex City in honor of both Gaia and our ancestry. She suggested building another one in the mountains in the Casaibo District, it was indeed a good idea. It was a valley protected by the mountains and I imagine there are members who would prefer to live in the mountains as oppose to the coast. She and Antoine were inseparable, from rumors I&#39;ve heard, it seems he was quite like her back in France and now they were basically the same only they were monogamous and completely devoted to each other!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had only entered my own office to see what Roberto had done with it months ago, but now was using it more frequently because the chair was really soothing to my back and was reviewing the articles of war to be presented to The Council, which changed daily with the adding of names of newly identified dead. Just seeing the updated copy on my desk when I entered made me sick!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first days the mermaids kept to the large stones away from shore, but now they would venture to the beaches were people went. Everyone was curious and I heard that many children gave them pucas, basically beaded necklaces and many little girls would beg to brush their hair of many colors, I met with Sybil again and she says that the mermaids were actually loving the attention and that Queen Pasha would like to meet with me again. I agreed... The mermaids were indeed behaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Orwell finally returned with 17 vampires. I received them in the throne room in a black dress which had an opening split at the front of dark purple fabric enhancing by pregnancy with the same jewelry I used to greet the French and Sardinians, I mean it feels weird and wasteful to use something new for different people! Ximena matched it with gold sandals and Isaura added gold beads which had inscribed protective runes on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Orwell, it&#39;s good to finally have you back home, how were your travels?!&#34; For a moment I was afraid something bad had happened to him. I had Phoebe by my side as now was custom and she wore and backless dark purple dress to match with what I wore. Her wings in clear display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you can see my Queen, I have brought guests interested in making Karaya their home.&#34; The court had many spectators interested in the vampires even though it was after hours, they are usually mortal enemies to wolves but people wanted to see how this went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are all very welcomed here, Orwell has been a trusted advisor, I wish we too can reach trust among us and that you can also call Karaya home.&#34; There were four children among them, I wondered if they were born or made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are most gracious and welcoming beautiful Queen, most of us are wonderers who pay no homage to any Blood Clan Chieftains. My name is Lutherus Viotto, we have heard that Karaya is accepting those of our kind and Orwell has confirmed such rumors. I have been roaming the Earth since the time Justinian held The Byzantine Empire, I bring my wife Amdis and our first natural son Kieran, seeking respite from our travels.&#34; He had hair as black as my own, very pale skin and the very black eyes which many of his kind posses, he was tall and slender and very elegant. If he is from the era of Justinian he is possibly older than Moira. His wife was also slender with very long pale gold wavy hair, her eyes were not black but hazel she was indeed very beautiful and by her name I imagine nordic. Their boy was a mirror of his father except he could not be older than 12, yet I know from my time in Avalon that a natural born vampire may appear of an age, yet still be much older.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natural? I congratulate you! My sisters from Avalon have always mentioned that it did happened yet that it took a very special kind of Bond between the parents for it to occur. You and your beautiful wife must love each other dearly and Kieran looks like he will be your mirror when he is of your same age.&#34; I am measuring my words by the centimeter, you can&#39;t assume anything with vampires, especially age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thank you for your kind words great Lady! You are as Orwell said. And knowing that you are a Priestess of Avalon and have lived harmoniously with our kind brings me comfort.&#34; He proceeded to introduce his companions one by one. Unlike with the mermaids, vampires dwell in pleasantries making simple introductions last for hours. They each had their histories they wished to recount and it went well into the night. My fucking back was killing me, thank the Goddesses for constant rapid regeneration or else I would have been rudely fidgeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all introductions were made Lutherus wanted to know of the Taicaraya serum used to walk in daylight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were able to see Orwell walk in the sun from our dark shelter, I remember still of the time before I being a vampire of walking in the sun as a fisherman before my Master created me. Hence one of our interests of accepting the invitation Orwell offered as well as finding a home. As you have already heard from my companions all children are naturally born and as you said rare. We are willing to pledge ourselves to your reign and laws and to take your Oath to be able to give our children the chance to be children... I imagine you wonder what their true ages are, but they are as you see, just children and my own sweet wife is again pregnant. As you yourself are, you can probably imagine the tiredness of pregnancy and the need for a home.&#34; Suania was on the mark about a baby boom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then Karaya shall be your home to enjoy a life on tranquility. As citizens you shall be granted the serum which must be administered through an IV drip monthly, yet to make it to your specifications I imagine Orwell explained that we must draw your blood as to make sure it&#39;s made to you specific DNA and molecular structure so that your body doesn&#39;t reject it. Once that&#39;s done the healers in charge will keep that information on record, to have the next batch ready for the month after and not go through that bother again. Does that sound well with you?&#34; Vampires may love blood, but they don&#39;t like their own blood to be spilled or taken. I can already see the discomfort in some of their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes my Queen he has informed us. We are willing to go through the process to walk in the sun again.&#34; Step one, check!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now on the next order of business... Feeding. I know that your people are not fond of blood from Supernaturals except for that of brownies and fauns. We already have a pan hybrid who is a citizen, we can&#39;t have feedings from citizens unless these are consensual. There are many islands around with humans where you can hunt, I ask you to please not kill any, unless you can read them as scum, in which case I don&#39;t care, but even so don&#39;t draw attention to yourselves or us so I beg discretion. We can also make sure to have human blood from Blood Banks readily available.&#34; I could go for a rare steak right about now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your terms are reasonable and acceptable my Queen.&#34; He responds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next item, we recently have made a pact with the surrounding mermaids, so far they have kept the peace, curiosity is fine but like before every interaction will remain consensual. I will give Orwell a copy of our treaty with them so you understand what they are and not allowed to do.&#34; To this they look at each other with some confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But mermaids can be tricky monsters great Lady we---&#34; I stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So are we! We are all considered monsters, but no greater monsters than prejudice and arrogance. We are trying to build a different place were all of our kind can live in peace away from the intervention of those who would hunt us for what we are and those who want to destroy the balance we have achieved. We are adapting to the Great Mother&#39;s wishes. I hope that you still will stay and help me achieve the will of the Goddesses but for this we must learn to trust each other.&#34; They look at the faces in the throne room. Wolves, fae hybrids, a werejaguar, Orwell, different species living together with no quarrels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He takes a knee and the others follow suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Queen, we are ready to give you our pledge and take your Oath to be citizens of this exceptional utopia you are building.&#34; I have the chalice brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you must excuse the taste, I am aware that Werewolf blood isn&#39;t to your taste but a sip is all it should take you join us, sadly I know your kind can&#39;t join the Link yet you will be gifted opal rings like this...&#34; I show him my own that I use to contact Morgana and I also gave one to Sybil to test it&#39;s range... &#34;To help with communication.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They drink from the chalice and it&#39;s done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Orwell will show you were you will be staying, he will be your escort and guide until you are settled. Do you have any questions?&#34; Goddesses I hope not! I link anyone in the kitchen to prep me that steak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No your Highness everything is quite clear we leave you so you may rest and feed your babies that steak they are craving.&#34; Ha!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thank you for your understanding ladies and gentlemen!&#34; I laugh. &#34;They are indeed ravenous!&#34;</p>
