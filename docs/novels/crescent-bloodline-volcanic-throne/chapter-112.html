                <p>Víctor&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think of the candidates I sent you?&#34; I ask Bayoán. &#34;I want this done before I go on leave.&#34; Magdalena&#39;s Heat is coming up and we will basically be locked in our apartment for a week. She&#39;s looking forward to it and has been making prayers and offerings for a successful one. The thought of having her to myself for that time and the possibility of a pup has me exited yet anxious, but we need to add another Beta beforehand or Izz will have a mental breakdown and she already has enough on her plate. Of the seven packs who asked for sanctuary only the ones in West Kyoto, Tonga and Rumania have agreed to every term and have been verified by Truth Seers. They have had several losses and the pack in Tonga is small, only about 200 but the ones in Japan and Rumania are quite large ones of about 3,000 give or take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I already linked Janaína and Shomari to come in this afternoon, Izzy was impressed by how he was able to get things done having been in the dungeons and how he kept his composure.&#34; I have a week to finish this and oversee the extractions, good thing is that some of the vampires have volunteered, that will help speed things up. We already have 3 teams on their way to Mahina Katoa Pack, Enpaiamun Pack and Slujitorii Zeitei, Natalia was on her way with an additional team East of Mumbai, where Chandrama kee Chhaaya insisted for sanctuary yet THEIR Alpha wanted to be mate to ours. Izz had already ordered that any pack that put forth such a suggestion be left alone, yet their Beta and the pack have rebelled against him and have him chained in silver. Apparently the situation is deteriorating fast there and that pack is over 7,000 wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Chandrama do come over that will raise our numbers to well above 40,000, maybe we should just include both Janaína and Shomari don&#39;t you think?&#34; I can feel Bayo making the calculations in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With Natalia leading the negotiations I believe you are right, good thing is that Federico nor João have raised any shit for considering Janaína so that&#39;s a problem off the plate. And the extraction of Tanzania went smoothly thanks to Shomari&#39;s very precise calculations... I had asked Phoebs to verify any foul play, but she assured that everything checked out, so we could just call this a formality, yet I still want to check out Janaína&#39;s speed. If we end up with the numbers after Chandrama we will definitely need a fourth.&#34; The city in the Caney District still was near completion and many wanted to relocate there, as well as requesting more isolated villages. This is something that we were already expecting, many wolves are not comfortable in big cities, including us, so Nina has put Kappas to work to finish it so she can focus on renovations on old towns that were almost empty. Loiza&#39;s plans are the most ambitious any Alpha has put forward and she insisted on the development of a community in Karayita, Orwell liked the idea since the vampires would feel more comfortable there and they wanted to have businesses to encourage visits from the main island yet still have a little more seclusion. All in all we are indeed turning less from a pack and more into a country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After going to the shrines I went with the pups to the lagoon. I sat on the shore and enjoyed how the twins were enjoying their first taste of sand and putting their little sea legs (or rather sea hands and knees) to the test. I hadn&#39;t visited with Pasha since they were born and was hoping she would show up. She didn&#39;t disappoint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has been a while wolf sister, yes?&#34; She stated as she swam towards the pups. Nature made me alert and she noticed and for the first time I saw her laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not hurt your offspring Loiza, just curious!&#34; I felt embarrassed at my paranoia, they did help deliver them after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Pasha, it&#39;s just... I have never been a mother before and instinct kicked in.&#34; Plus I still have so much confusion, responsibilities and I must admit, fear of deavas and why they keep looking for me. I want to just focus on our war against The Council, yet I have never been a fan of unknowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need for apologies, yes? My own sisters become protective of their offspring from everyone, as I am protective of them. Your just proving nature&#39;s purpose of procreation and it is also in the interest of my people that they are protected. It is with them that our pact will continue when you&#39;re time comes to leave this plane and join the realm of the Goddess. Yes?&#34; When I leave this plane... Hopefully it will be a long time, yet we never know when that time will come. I give her a bitter smile, but she has a point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right of course, one day my time will be done and it&#39;s one of them that will be here talking with you, I hope you have many good conversations and I hope you also help advise them.&#34; Each of her entities goes to each pup and my worries fade away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My sisters have informed me of the events with the demons that infested your brother and mate...&#34; Well as always Karaya doesn&#39;t disappoint in blabbing to everyone what goes on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I think that&#39;s also what has me a bit on edge, I will tell you a secret like the one I know of you. I fear them... I don&#39;t know what they want or who&#39;s sending them, it&#39;s the only thing I fear right now. One of them I could have taken as a coincidence, but two... And possessing people I care for... It makes me feel I don&#39;t have the power to understand what&#39;s going on and weak. I can&#39;t afford to be weak Pasha, our pack keeps growing and I need to know that I am capable of protecting them, my pups and you. I don&#39;t even know if they can infest you and yours.&#34; She looks thoughtful while taking the pups and putting them a little deeper into the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have never have had problems of possessions by demons among us, yet I heard you have a way of avoiding them?&#34; She goes underwater and resurfaces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, a tattoo. This tattoo to be exact.&#34; And I show her my ankle where one of the the tattoos to repeal deavas and other demons is. She examines it studying every symbol it contains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a very old incantation from the East. Karaya is sanctuary not just to those you are bringing, but to us as well, my people feel safe in Karaya&#39;s waters and feel better when we are close. I will order every mermaid to have one made... Some of them have already gotten art on their skin, for us it is painless and heal immediately. Humans say: &#39;Better safe than sorry&#39; yes? We will comply with being safe and making sure that whomever is looking for you in such a violent matter does not find you? You keep me safe, I keep you safe.&#34; I felt overwhelmed, she didn&#39;t have to do this. But the fact that she wanted to protect me as much as I her made me feel a special camaraderie, as well as the fact that the mermaids were indeed finding safety in Karaya and feeling comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept going under water near the pups and it made me wonder...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do they smell like me under water?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I am trying to figure out... They smell of you and what I suspect is their father, yet they don&#39;t smell like US like YOU do. They smell of wolf, but not as a creature of the Ocean as you.&#34; I looked as they splashed the water but didn&#39;t know if I felt relief or disappointment. Yet it increased my own curiosity of what in Hades I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pasha... Do you have any theories of why would a wolf like me have that scent?&#34; Phoebe was trying to figure that out, but with the work of double checking the packs that were to come and drawing up a very specific contract with Ayana for fae folk that wish to come, she&#39;s had to put it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None, I have never smelled a creature not of the Ocean who smells as us. But I will look into old stone carved tablets to see if there is anything else resembling this phenomenon yes?&#34; She saw that this was making me worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I would appreciate any information on this. Before Sybil told me I had no idea.&#34; She started splashing the twins and they were enjoying the play, but inside I was wondering if I was some kind of freak of nature, especially now that I knew that my children hadn&#39;t inherited this trait. It actually did give me some relief though, yet I didn&#39;t know why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are worrying too much Loiza, we will find out the answers to these questions, yes?&#34; I looked as she kept playing with the pups, but my uneasiness didn&#39;t fade. From what she had told me before, none of my siblings had that smell and now I know that my babies don&#39;t have it either. What the fuck am I?</p>
