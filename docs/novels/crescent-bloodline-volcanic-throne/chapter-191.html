                <p>Guadalupe answers Bisabuelo...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Under that condition I would feel comfortable doing the work Abuelo, Gabi and I do what we can but for the size of our family we do NEED a spiritual guide in the hacienda... Loiza, cousin you have led ceremonies for our family when you were Priestess, we obviously maintain the most sacred rituals and ceremonies for the Temple according to the will of the Goddess and our Great Mother, but I guess you now have a better understanding of our numbers and needs.&#34; Indeed! I had only gone through runs through Lobo Azul like everyone does but I had never been inside, it&#39;s open to visitors like other historical buildings... Nina has been taking pictures non stop of the family but also of details she likes and would like to add to Hacienda Florencia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine Guadalupe! We have another pack coming soon, they have a Priestess, if she wants to stay on I think it would be fine but if not I will definitely ask Moira. You&#39;d be surprised how there&#39;s a waiting list of Priestesses that want to come here and are coaxing their own packs, covens, blood clans and tribes in Farie to join us, but you must understand how careful we have to be now. I&#39;m only going to accept those who we had ALREADY had come to agreements before our revenge against The Council, my top priority is the safety of this island.&#34; Abuelo patted my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see how easy my job of being Mentor to your Bisnieta will be Father?!&#34; Bisabuelo was brimming!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed mijo! Loiza your words calm this old man! We WILL do our best to ensure that your reign is long mija, and every one of us pledges loyalty to either one of these two who rule after! Kayden, my Alpha, I thank you for these precious treasures!&#34; That&#39;s really sweet but...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you thanking HIM for?! I&#39;m the one who pushed them out!&#34; He barked out a laugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! You BLOCKED ME OUT! Don Juan, your lovely Bisnieta can be a RUTHLESS TYRANT sometimes! She&#39;ll get hers when she gets her next Heat! I&#39;m DEFINITELY going to make damn sure it&#39;s SUCCESSFUL, I missed out on the twin&#39;s birth and naming, I&#39;ll make sure she&#39;ll give you another grandchild SOON!&#34; I&#39;m starting to think it was a mistake to let him keep his title of Alpha! Me and my stupid ideas of trying to still let him have SOME RESPECT and DIGNITY! I elbowed him in the ribs pouting, but Bisabuelo was even more delighted laughing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You give her a piece of her own medicine my boy! Ha! Mija in this I agree with the Alpha, there was a lot of sadness in the pack Link after that ordeal in Blood Moon. Don&#39;t worry Kayden, we always make sure that the Shrines are properly kept and the offerings made to ensure successful Heats for EVERYONE of our family! Also there&#39;s a special spell on this property and Hacienda Florencia... Let&#39;s just say it will INSPIRE you! Now that I&#39;ll hand the reigns to Lupita I&#39;ll be able to enjoy my family more! Blessed Be!&#34; Kayden looked at me all smug, I just shook my head at his shameless whining to my great grandfather, he DID miss out on the twins, so I let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be fair, after seeing what Morgana went through, my pregnancy would have been a BREEZE if Kayden would have been with me, especially if we were already awake! We know how Twin Souls move their energy... I&#39;m actually a bit confused as to why WE aren&#39;t Twin Souls NOW. That WAS a part of the deal! And suddenly he&#39;s back to his old shit of giving me little &#39;white&#39; lies... I have to have a conversation with his fucking Lordship and tell him to cut the crap! Just little over a week from our Awakening and as happy as I am, we ARE an old married couple, I&#39;m not ok with this childish shit at my age! And I look at my Bisabuelo and I kinda get the guy! Meh, in a way I&#39;m an old hag too!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So your wolf is blue then? Maco that&#39;s absolutely fine! I told you I AM one myself, if it hasn&#39;t manifested until now there&#39;s a big chance that it may never will, but IF it does come over we&#39;ll help train you. Wow! To have the mutation active is very rarely found in Gammas, now that we have your blood sample we&#39;ll be verifying your coding closer cousin. Next full Moon you can come with us so you can get to know the others better, don&#39;t worry Maco there&#39;s NOTHING wrong with you. We&#39;ll start after we put everything in order but I think maybe Amelia herself would like to study your genetic structure. As your mate it will help her help you and your mind will be more at ease with your own Matriarch checking it out. What do you think Amelia?&#34; Mero is indeed a very beautiful wolf! They are called Blue Wolves the same way that my hair is considered blue... It&#39;s so black and lustrous that it gives a blue hue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s the reason this hacienda is called Lobo Azul, most Guerrero wolves ARE blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you KIDDING?! I would LOVE to check it out! I had only heard of the mutation before but I didn&#39;t know about the whole blue wolf aspect, it will give me a better understanding of not just my own pup, but our nieces and nephews too. Do you think it would manifest in Bayo&#39;s son, is there potential for the mutation in hybrids?&#34; Morgana and Bayoán became very interested in that. Salvatore and Florentino were in deep though linking each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know? We don&#39;t remember any, we WOULD have remembered something as rare, we&#39;ll add it to what we will investigate about our little cousin. And remember, your wolf doesn&#39;t have to be blue to carry the mutation. Either way I can&#39;t stress this enough, there&#39;s nothing wrong with the mutation except for the fact of it&#39;s stigmatized and the difficulties of finding a mate. I myself haven&#39;t had the chance to meet mine, every time new wolves come we&#39;re very excited to see if those of us who haven&#39;t been able to find our mates find them then. It&#39;s a wonderful thing that you found Amelia, Maco. I&#39;m 30 and nothing, I go to the Shrines to BEG the Goddess to just send ONE!&#34; I look at Maco and I he doesn&#39;t look comforted by that at ALL. I look over at Ura, he&#39;s focused on his plate. I reach out to Maco...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What&#39;s wrong? You heard him, even if it manifests you&#39;ll be fine!&#39; If anyone can control themselves in any situation it&#39;s most definitely you!&#39; I ask him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Izz, I&#39;m not worried about THAT, well maybe a little I KNOW what happened with you guys and that Lycan... I don&#39;t want ANOTHER mate. I don&#39;t care if they do love each other or not, I JUST want Em. Can you just talk to Moira about that? Tell her to send any to our cousins who have none. I&#39;m BEGGING here Izzy!&#39; Awe, he really loves Em and feels like it would be a betrayal to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;ll talk to her brother, but you know that&#39;s not how it works! The Goddess has to take into consideration the genetic makeup of someone to match with where there&#39;s more potential for reproduction, and those in these types of matings live harmoniously. It&#39;s just very stressful for the male, and even then the Goddess gives respite.&#39; I should know... They would come BEGGING to my Temple for it! I&#39;ll talk with Moira for an audience with Selene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since my days in Avalon there was still debate on this issue, one of the girls of my year, Autumn, was the Delta daughter of her father&#39;s SECOND mate and she said that it was a happy home and that she loved her father&#39;s first mate as her own mother. To her and her siblings it was like having two mothers doting on them. She was very clear that her mother was as in love with BOTH of her mates equally. She&#39;s a pretty cool chick and her little own group of friends were very nice too. I only curtsied and blew the wind at Blood Moon when she came with Moira, she decided to stay in Avalon and go all the way to her Prime Priestess training. She did mention that her wolf was also blue. Either way I know it must be a BITCH for Selene to sort it out. To recalibrate the damage done by that genocide she must be VERY precise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Just talk with her! I don&#39;t want another mate not just because Amelia is my Universe, but Izz I won&#39;t have time to work on the other stuff we want for our family, Florentino linked saying that he&#39;ll introduce our Tío and cousin with multiple mates TOMORROW because they are usually VERY busy with each of their THREE mates and children! You guys would have to get an APPOINTMENT to be able to even see me! Ugh! I don&#39;t need that hassle Izzy PLEASE!&#39; I can&#39;t help but chuckle, but he&#39;s not wrong, he could even loose his company, he wouldn&#39;t have time for his other passions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I told you I WOULD Maco, chill out! It was hard enough for you to find Amelia and look at poor Salvatore! I bet he spends a good amount of cash at either of The Districts, remember his Lycan is ACTIVE and must be going crazy trying to reproduce, with how apparently okay it is to have a Formal Concubine here I&#39;m kind of curious why he doesn&#39;t have one! I&#39;ll see if I can put a word for him too! We most definitely need him to be able to really focus on his research, look at the problem the near extinction of ONE breed has caused in our world! Remember it&#39;s really personal for us now knowing that we carry the gene! We now have to be more aware of the pups and any other children we ALL have. Now I have to make sure the training and education of the twins is on point! Imagine how it would be if our future Alpha is a Lycan!&#39; He&#39;s nodding understanding the other repercussions. It&#39;s not just HIM we have watch out for it&#39;s ALL of us and the kids! Although the only one of us whose wolf is blue is Maco... Sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is a little bit uncomfortable for Ura and myself... A few years ago we had a close encounter with a Lycan in Syria. He was fully feral, I tried to control his water, but my powers then are nothing like now and Lycans are extremely strong. Urayoán was watching from a crow&#39;s nest he was using for a better position with his favorite rifle to snipe our target, I was to stay close to the ground to pick up the package when Urayoán linked me saying he had scented a Lycan headed my way. When he saw that I was struggling he took the shot hitting him through the eye giving me time to decapitate him. After we finished the mission we checked the Lycans now human body trying to find any signs of who he was but there weren&#39;t any, it seemed he was a rogue. OPIA retrieved the body and head. Ura and I weren&#39;t ok... Since Lycans are not new to us and we knew how rare they were we didn&#39;t want to kill him, but Ura made the call and I gave the killing blow... He started carrying more silver bullets and silver tipped arrows after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was strange for Ura and me handing in a report indicating how we had just killed a Lycan. Even though our mission was successful and we retrieved the package which we were sent for, we were faced with an impossible decision of ending someone we would really try to help. I felt guilty enough without the people telling Ura and me that no one was blaming us for what happened and that they understood the situation... We knew there were trying to console us but it was making us feel very uncomfortable. &#34;I&#39;m feeling firsthand the feeling you shared with me of how you felt when you returned from Avalon.&#34; He was pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t feel guilty AT ALL! For him it was either his sister or a stranger, PERIOD. The way people were phrasing it indicated that they thought that he could have waited a little longer to make the call since I am a Priestess who should be able to overpower a Lycan, which I was working on. But Ura is extremely practical to the point where if the situation turns into one that you have to make split-second decisions he goes directly to the bones of the original plan. He never lost focus of our original mission...  and the hassle and noise for dealing with the Lycan was more likely than not going to disturb the prey and we would have lost our shot of getting the hell out of Syria sooner which for the past few years is no fun at all! We really wanted to get home ASAP it&#39;s not fun to hang out in a country at war. Especially when you have exceptional hearing and they can&#39;t stop bombing each other!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ura&#39;s prime instinct of his Gamma is a HUNTER, there is no greater woe to a Hunter than to leave his prized prey slip from his fingers. So we decided to take the Lycan out of the equation so that we could finish our mission and get the hell out of Dodge. He did make sure that the kill was clean as to not inflict any pain on our foe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It obviously became gossip on the island which pissed him even more! Urayoán hates gossip, he gets his information through all the contacts he has here and usually takes information from first hand accounts. For him, if YOU weren&#39;t THERE, you don&#39;t don&#39;t know jack shit about what really happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just know a few of them, either way, I know to trust his contacts more than the press who loves to embellish gossip...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the world is in the state it was, we had a shot of reclaiming some of our lands back... The protection system towards our Island Maco and Gadiel are working on will also protect Karayita and other small keys in our territory. Karaya is the main island but you could say we&#39;re more of a small archipelago and my next move is to increase the number of islands under that archipelago. Ura&#39;s contacts have already informed him of several islands in our vicinity that are absolutely empty, mostly just small sand dunes, others as big as Karayita but with a few rich humans... shouldn&#39;t be a problem taking. One ended up being three times the size of Karayita more to the South between us and Venezuela. As far as if we have been able to find out it is under the jurisdiction of absolutely no country, only one dude. It&#39;s OURS now bitch!</p>
