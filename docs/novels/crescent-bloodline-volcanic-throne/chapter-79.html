                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days went smoothly, the new members felt happy through the Link. Fatima moved in last week and her and Roxana which is only one year older than Fatima have quickly become inseparable. They both decided in their free time to help Samira and Louis open a Middle Eastern restaurant downtown. It would open after Samira gave birth which could happen at any moment. The shrine to Gaia I ordered be put in The Fort&#39;s gardens was finished and stood only a few feet away from that of Selene&#39;s. To get to the walled four acres of the gardens, you have to go down to the first floor down the outside stairwell, where they have bloomed for almost five centuries for the inhabitants of The Fort. The first Osupa all lived inside The Alpha&#39;s Fort so even the gardens where protected from outsiders. As the old historic walled Citadel grew the old Alpha&#39;s made sure to have parks and gardens as the population grew and people left The Fort for just the Alpha and his or her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was on my way there now to thank both Goddesses for their blessings with two dozen white roses for Selene and another two dozen green ones for Gaia. They made Gaia&#39;s shrine resemble that of Selene&#39;s, none bigger than the other and both made of coral stone with altars of white quartz that sparkled so many colors, with the sacred pentagram ingrained in the white quartz made of black quartz. Selene&#39;s had the symbol for the Moon as Gaia&#39;s had the symbol for Earth. I was dressed in a white chiton style sleeveless robe, my hair loose and unbraided with no jewelry and bare feet in humility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went first to Selene&#39;s and laid out the roses and prayed the prayer I have known since I was a child. I activated the elements on the lower corners of the pentagram and in the white marble bowl for the point of the divine placed the blessed parchment with the prayer with my gratitude, with a dagger I cut my finger dropping seven drops of my blood and snapped my finger lighting a white flame so the smoke of my prayer would reach her realm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I went to that of Gaia with the same ritual, but used a prayer I remembered from the Gibberish Book and did the same in the sacred pentagram, except that when I lit it the flames turned green instead of white. I asked if she was pleased with the shrine, not that I expected an answer. I stayed in the gardens for sometime making sure that the spell that protected the gardens for the salt of the close by sea was intact. I sat on a white quartz bench in between the shrines under an ever blooming blue flamboyán tree. Some blossoms on the ground, yet strangely one blossom was yellow. I picked it up and my thoughts went to Kayden and for a moment I felt him thinking of me and made me smile. I didn&#39;t want to let go of the blossom which reminded of the warmth of the sun... I felt Deacon calling for Aryn and me. I felt their sorrow, their regret, their yearning. Our particular mate scent filled me stronger than the scent of the flowers of the gardens. I tried to keep my feelings neutral, but alas, it was impossible, no matter what had happened, I loved him, his jade eyes came into my mind and unconsciously I put my hand to my stomach feeling the heart beats inside. I stood and went back to Gaia&#39;s shrine and put the blossom in the marble bowl with the green flames that suddenly became bright yellow. It gave me comfort as if he was there, I heard his voice call out my name, I looked behind me as if he was there... It was so vivid!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was I going crazy?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Not crazy. Sadly you are very sane.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gaia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**You where always good at riddles child ever flowing as water.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leave the shrine and go to the bench and sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for guiding me, thank you for the Mark, I almost hurt a lot of people without it. Why do you guide me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**You can bring harmony and balance.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I doing that now? Am I doing your will Great Mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Yes, you are following the guidance of my grimoire. It lives inside you now. As the children that grow inside you.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Gibberish Book is your grimoire?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Yes**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you who mated me with Kayden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Yes.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Because not even I can go against The Fates. Destiny is written and you both must face yours. He risked everything to have you by his side again and the contract can&#39;t be broken**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who Kayden?&#34; For some reason I don&#39;t want the answer and pivot. &#34;Is Kayden guilty of what I saw?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**He was guilty of felling fear.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Fear of the lifetime granted after so long.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see another yellow blossom in the ocean of blue again. I look up at the tree, yet there are no yellow blossoms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So long ago...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**You must stop your quarrel with Aryn. There must be harmony between you.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, it&#39;s just hard to bear right now. To follow your will I must remain focused.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**I understand. The burden we have placed on you both is great.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We? Both?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Selene is child of my loins as well, she has guided your childhood, I will do so now. Retain your devotion, remain true to your duty. You are building our will. Expect more to come.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed that she didn&#39;t answer my second question and as a Priestess know not to ask again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Isla also a child of your loins? Is that why her touch on the Mark you gave me soothed me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**You have always been clever.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should I do next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Keep following your intuition. You will know when the right time for everything shall be.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Kayden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**He is growing following his own path. You will know when he is ready. You will know when you are ready.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you say... Blessed Be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get up and head back picking a Water Lily from the pond and enjoy it&#39;s scent while returning... Water lilies... I have to make things right with him, too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pass the gates that lead to Placid Lagoon outside The Fort walls. It&#39;s surrounded by large breakwater stones to protect it from the strong waves at the very bottom of the cliff that holds The Fort, I go down the steps... I don&#39;t remember the last time I was here. I sit on the shore letting the water kiss my feet. I take off my dress and walk in the water feeling so at peace. I feel small fish nibble at my skin tickling me making me smile. I have noticed more pods of dolphins in our waters... I don&#39;t remember there being so many, even orcas! I start floating letting my body be carried by the waters... Then I felt something poke me on my back! I put my feet down looking for whatever it was and catch a glimpse of a large fin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; I ask and then feel stupid. I start walking to the shore but something grabs my ankle, I almost stumble yet catch my bearings and I look down at what is holding me. She had long yellow hair, double irises in the colors of yellow and sour apple green with eel type long orange fins. I haven&#39;t seen a mermaid since I left Avalon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can let me go, if you wish to talk to me I will listen.&#34; I affirm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She goes back into deeper water and hooks her finger for me to go to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not happening, I will speak with you here. How can I help you?&#34; I&#39;m not an idiot, mermaids use glamour and magic to draw people in and eat them till not even bones are left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolls her eyes. Yeah roll all you want missy, I&#39;m still not following.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have the power to create storms yet you fear me?&#34; Still not falling for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am still here ain&#39;t I? My body&#39;s still in the water.&#34; I go closer to the shore and sit in the water. &#34;You&#39;re welcome to join me in conversation right here. I am alone, no one will disturb us.&#34; She looks at me suspiciously. I&#39;m patient, I can wait until she is ready. I sat for over an hour never taking my eyes off of her. Fuck THIS, I&#39;m done waiting. &#34;I&#39;m leaving now, if you want I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t have any more time to wait.&#34; And as I stand she grabs my ankle again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you STOP! You want to talk or not?!&#34; She sat next to where I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See? That wasn&#39;t so hard right?&#34; I sit again next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is Loiza what&#39;s yours?&#34; I ask watchfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sybil.&#34; She answers plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Sybil, now can I help you with something?&#34; She looks confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you, a warewolf smell like my sisters and me?&#34; What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand, I was told that I smelled of pinnap---&#34; But she cuts me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, yes pineapples and vanilla... I am talking about your scent in the sea. All creatures smell different under the waters of the ocean.&#34; Interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know that, thank you for that information, but I don&#39;t know why that&#39;s my scent. So I&#39;m sorry if I can&#39;t answer your question Sybil.&#34; She looks up at The Fort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are allowing creatures other than wolves to live in Karaya?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am, do you need sanctuary?&#34; Again her eyes not trusting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sanctuary?&#34; Well I guess that was dumb, what sanctuary would a mermaid need?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nevermind, it was nice talking with you Sybil, I hope to see you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t go on shore without being hunted.&#34; I had seen mermaids in Avalon but they stayed far away and distrustful, so I never spoke with one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know mermaids wanted to go to shore.&#34; Just spit it out already, I&#39;m hungry. And just then my stomach growls. Great...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks at it and smiles. &#34;I am keeping you from feeding your babies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, so if you have anything you want to ask I beg you to hurry it up.&#34; I say with some irritation in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sanctuary, we would like to be in the shores, sit by the rocks, learn more of land dwellers.&#34; Very interesting!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean you want to... hangout?&#34; Is she serious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind you hanging out on our shores and no one will hunt you, but it goes both ways Sybil, I give you my word that you shan&#39;t be hurt in anyway, but we have rules and I will not tolerate any attacks on my people.&#34; She is thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe our Queen could talk with you?&#34; Another treaty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have heard that you can leave the water under special circumstances. If your Queen wishes to meet with me for a formal treaty of sanctuary to be in our shores I am willing to grant an audience to come to terms that shall suit both our people and my number one term would be no hunting from either side. We are islanders and love the sea, so I agree to share our waters with the Mere folk only with a formal treaty of mutual peace. Send my message to your Queen, understood?&#34; She slowly nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will come back tomorrow with our Queen&#39;s answer. I extend my hand to shake her finned one.&#34; She looks at it for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We shake on it! I am showing goodwill that I have no weapon to hurt you with.&#34; She takes my hand and I shake it slowly so as not to startle her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I shall return tomorrow at this same time wolf sister.&#34; I let go and stand getting out of the water and go to my dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same time tomorrow Sybil. I shall be here, and don&#39;t forget what you said yourself I have the power to create storms, so no tricks, do you understand?&#34; She nods solemnly and swims away.</p>
