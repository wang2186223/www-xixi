                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for your cooperation in this matter Tía, I know that in that hard head of yours there lies a reasonable person somewhere.&#34; I&#39;m so DONE with all this fucking drama but we still have one more fish to fry and I wait for Maco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope that you have all noticed that we are settling every single dispute that has the potential of ripping our family. And hopefully each one will be settled today, which brings me to our final item for today. Umbros, Lola, what&#39;s wrong with you? Don&#39;t think we haven&#39;t noticed the tension between the both of you. Nina has sued for peace with Bayo, which we all know has existed since forever! You will settle whatever bone you have TODAY!&#34; Maco has been really flexing today! The way he took down Tía with threatening to scatter her bones to the wind was a stroke of genius! In my mind as Phi I really don&#39;t care where my body ends up, but my mortal mind can&#39;t compute not joining my family&#39;s bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh by the Goddess&#39;s mercy YES! I am so fucking sick as shit of these two fighting and then getting me involved! For shizzle!&#34; Talia has been at her wits end with those two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey don&#39;t look at me, I WISH I knew why this stupid pendejo has it out for me, he didn&#39;t use to be this way!&#34; Then directly at her brother... &#34;I&#39;m so glad that this is being brought up, WHAT exactly IS YOUR PROBLEM?!&#34; Lola is furious! Her heart is pounding a mile a minute and her face is slightly red from anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&#34; Seriously Umbros?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut the bullshit Umbros! We ALL see it, and I know for a fact that Lola has no fucking clue! I&#39;m sure that your Truth Seer gift let&#39;s you see that! Now spit it out and be DONE with it!&#34; Ura has been pissed at Umbros for a while now about this. He loves Tali, especially as a Circle member, but he&#39;s always gotten along best with Lola. I have my own special Bonds with Tali, but I have only been in one mission with her and Umbros. It&#39;s usually Lola the one Ura and I pleaded for if we needed a third, she&#39;s going to flip when she see what I got her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Umbros and him are the same age and used to get along really well and Umbros is a fierce fighter and the best at wielding Baná, we wanted him in more missions, but his attitude with Lola would make us loose focus. Truth Seer or not, Lola was more useful and better tempered in an assignment making our job very easy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cousin I&#39;m having a fucking BLAST today dishing out Alpha commands! There&#39;s ALWAYS room for more. So spill it out or I&#39;ll order you to, I am DONE with your childish attitude! Now TALK!&#34; This is so stupid!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For FUCKS SAKE FINE! Fucking cunt took the man I loved and now he&#39;s dead because she couldn&#39;t commit and NOW she&#39;s happily mated!&#34; Are you...?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you seriously talking about Lorenzo PENDEJO?! I KNOW this bullshit can&#39;t be about LORENZO! No wonder he would say you were a PETTY ASSHOLE! Did HE KNOW?!&#34; WHOA! I didn&#39;t expect it to be about this?! And now that I smell him...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you PUTA! He was PERFECT and you couldn&#39;t make up your mind after so long?!&#34; The fucking hypocrite!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHOA! WHOA! We&#39;ve never even called Nina a slut, and she TOTALLY IS! No slut shamming here! And besides, Lola was ONLY with him! And she found her True Mate! So what?! Didn&#39;t we JUST talk about Isla?! And look at you fucking hypocrite! YOU DARE slut shame?! I KNOW of your constant visits to The District and it wasn&#39;t for any shows! I bet you&#39;ve had more ass than Lola BY FAR making YOU THE FUCKING SLUT! And see?! No one gave a fuck! Where&#39;s YOUR MATE? Why aren&#39;t you Marked?!&#34; Oh, tricky wolf I smell him on you! I feel Ura trying to pinpoint the scent!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HEY I---What do you mean?&#34; WHY is he SOOO much like Tía?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s from Blood Moon, a Gamma, probably one of Kayden&#39;s men since he REEKS of Marcus. Thanks Tali for the confirmation!&#34; One of Kayden&#39;s Gammas? Urayoán&#39;s nose NEVER fails! Well maybe sometimes. I know Avis was taken by Sammy...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy shit! Your mate is ADAM?! You&#39;ve been mated for days! WHY AREN&#39;T YOU MARKED?! Does he want to reject you?!&#34; I&#39;ll KILL HIM!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys are ok with this?&#34; Huh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which part?&#34; Nía asks him very confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We ALL look at him very confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys don&#39;t care that he&#39;s a guy?&#34; Are you fucking KIDDING me?! He has been a thorn in our shoe because of THIS?! It&#39;s not like he&#39;s seen his sister and cousin to do their fair share with other women and his mother&#39;s best friend prefers the company of gentlemen. This is STANDARD to us!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re ABSOLUTELY confused, where on Earth did you get the notion that THIS would actually bother us? We&#39;re Osupa dude! We ALWAYS accept the decision of the Goddess no matter what! Since we&#39;re talking about the Guerrero&#39;s didn&#39;t they have that baby boom after one of their ancestors found a second mate at the same time with his first mate and those two females also fell in love? They found out that they carry the Lycan mutation! Bayoán how many reported cases are there on the island of males with more than one mate because of this mutation? And that&#39;s without mentioning the cases of women that have more than one chosen mate. It&#39;s intimate life and nobody&#39;s business if it&#39;s consensual. And with the males with more than one mate, the Goddess recalibrates the relationship making the women fall in love with each other as well! But so far it&#39;s only been reported for those with the Lycan mutation! That mutation is very powerful and has been hunted down to almost Extinction, again Selene is the Goddess of BALANCE! What she&#39;s doing is BASIC biology! You know this! Why would you think WE&#39;RE different?&#34; I look at Maco with a confused look and he just shrugs and it&#39;s just as confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lycans are a RARE breed of warewolf that has three shift modes... Human and wolf like the rest of us, yet they have and in between shift which makes them look much like the werewolves of human horror stories and movies. And just like in the movies this breed cannot control this shift in the full Moon, they are conscience and they can battle but they have to be in THAT form. The mutation is usually mostly present in Deltas, and yet they in many occasions can be as strong as an Alpha. When we shift to full wolves humans just see a very big wolf! They want to hunt us too because it&#39;s a rare trophy, but when the horror stories started coming out of different countries, the humans went on a hunting spree, they had pretty good hunters with a lot of knowledge about us and that particular mutation. And the hunting became out of control when werewolf movies started coming out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their numbers are recovering now but very slowly, so as biology dictates a male is fertile 24/7 every single day, so the Goddess grants a harem as if they were walruses to increase the reproduction of the mutation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many men might read this and think it is the most awesome thing ever! But when you are a male in this situation your SOLE purpose is to focus on procreation. The Goddess alternates the heat of the females to make sure that the male still can perform EVERY single duty as if he only had one mate and still keep his duties to the pack, you&#39;re not asked to go out in the field but you do have to train and be prepared to protect your mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually combat is not required for the female in this particular case since they&#39;re pregnant most of the time! It&#39;s not as fun as people think! The instinct to gratify their mates become so strong that the male sometimes even passes out from exhaustion more frequently than people know! I even had some come to my Temple BEGGING for the Goddess to give them at the very least a year break! Don&#39;t get me wrong they still LOVE ALL of their mates equally, they usually just want to not have sex for that year, it used to be the most awkward yet hysterical request I had to plead with the Goddess! But she usually granted it and since the females love each other as well, they tend to gratify each other. I have never heard of one of these families have any discord over the male, so I just assumed that Selene knows what she&#39;s doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;21 reported cases and 5 of the males have 3 mates and two have FOUR! Umbros are you SERIOUS right now?!&#34; Bayo is angry but mostly trying to understand where would Umbros would get the notion that he was doing anything wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know that! Thank you for that new information! Well I guess I&#39;m not having my own bones thrown overboard with Mom&#39;s, am I right? Sorry Lola no hard feelings I REALLY love my mate and he&#39;s really hot! Don&#39;t worry Amelia I will claim him the moment I reach home! Thanks for the pep talk!&#34; Amelia facepalms herself and Lola stands up LIVID with INTENT TO MURDER and leaps over Umbros and starts beating the shit out of him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it! I knew some blood would be spilled today! Almost done and I still had hope that it would go well!&#34; Maco says while going to pull her off of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy, another Alpha command here could actually be REALLY useful!&#34; Bayoán says as he goes help Maco. I look at Tali&#39;s, Ura&#39;s and Nina&#39;s smile. Tía sits down from standing up from the shock and starts drinking her coffee. And Nía is standing and shouting Lola&#39;s name rooting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... Not yet, I&#39;ll allow this for a little longer... You were staying in the island when we were out there dealing with HIS BULLSHIT! You only had to deal with his moodiness when he was in Island! And don&#39;t give me the Nina excuse because we still had to deal with her own shit when we were here AND the field! So we basically had to deal with her shit DOUBLE time! And then to top it off the man can&#39;t fly and drive to safe his or OUR damn lives! Tali has had to deal with THIS for a long time and Lola has been the target of something she didn&#39;t even know! Don&#39;t worry he&#39;ll heal! GIT HIM LOLA!&#34; Maco and Bayo are still sweating it and I pour another shot of vodka and raise it to them when they look for me for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want my help? The Beta take the Gamma and the Gamma take the Epsilon! Seriously guys do I have to think of everything for you?! What if I didn&#39;t have an Alpha command? You&#39;re both supposed to be the top minds and physically strongest of our family! Sorry my mistake, it&#39;s just since Tía is so old I don&#39;t even take her Beta rank into consideration. Talia since you have been with them the longest you will determine when the ass kicking to your brother ends, savvy?&#34; I take the shot! Oh yeah, that hit the spot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HEY?!&#34; Tía complains... I don&#39;t want to deal with her now. Keep drinking your coffee!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Savvy as fuck Izzy, I vow to be fair. PSYCH!&#34; Was he seriously thinking of DARING to reject his mate over this? I already had information that he would go to The Red Light District and enjoy his company with some gentleman, I never really paid much attention to it until now! It&#39;s not even something that is frowned upon here. Has he been spending too much time off Island that he&#39;s taking human traits?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umbros, while Lola is kicking your ass I have some questions, is it because you&#39;re spending so much time off Island that you&#39;re acting and thinking more like a human? This is not typical of Osupa behavior. That may be fine among elves who are so fucking prejudiced and maybe other packs, was it influenced by other packs? And you are not seriously considering rejecting your mate right?!&#34; I&#39;m crunching down next to him with a thoughtful face trying to pinpoint the source of the problem, while Lola just punches him in the face again and again! Shit! Got some blood on me, thank the Goddesses I chose to a black T-shirt!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I den&#39;t noow Isss, git&#39;er uff, wee telk!&#34; Yeah I understand... I look at Talia and she nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, Lola, enough!&#34; I don&#39;t have to command her and yet she completely stops. She KNOWS that I allowed her to vent her anger but to go further could REALLY injure him, although he has really injured HER. She roars at him her eyes full of tears, takes another shot of vodka and sticks her hand out to Nina obviously asking for a joint and walks out of the house! Shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get up ESTÚPIDO! Is that what you have been thinking of US all these years? Lola and Enzo we&#39;re together for YEARS? What? Were YOU in love with him? You didn&#39;t seem that heartbroken from the reports I get of all the times you go to The District! Was it your heart or your cock that was aching then? This is a BULLSHIT excuse! If this is true then you are still a child in your brain! And then to even do it with Enzo which she feels absolutely devastated even though she has found her mate. She wanted to REPAIR her relationship with him to be friends like I am more or less now with Victor! If Lorenzo knew it&#39;s because YOU told him! You stupid selfish pendejo! She was your SISTER&#39;S boyfriend! You complain about Tía, but it seems that the apple definitely doesn&#39;t fall far from the puta tree! Were you planning on being a homewrecker too cousin? To your own sister no less! What&#39;s the matter with you?! How could you also put HIM in that situation? You can&#39;t tell me you didn&#39;t know that he loved Lola, we ALL KNEW! Go after your sister NOW and FIX this or don&#39;t come back at all! I swear cousin, I love you, but I&#39;m willing to command Maco of banishing you over this! Where did you get this inferiority complex? And while you&#39;re making peace with your sister and BEGGING for her forgiveness find your mate and ours and bring him so that we can welcome our new family member! By the Goddess&#39;s Mercy you guys are going to KILL ME!&#34; I take the last of the joint Tali took from Tía. This is ridiculous! This is how Adelola must have felt when she met that pack in Martinique with those human ideals, it feels quite disgusting! Why do humans LIMIT their OWN free will? Even those that are not slaves! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever understand them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Umbros is in REALLY bad shape! In close combat and without his weapon he is no match against Lola. If I wouldn&#39;t have stopped her she would have beaten him into pudding! Still I manipulate the water in his body to quicken the healing process, hopefully be able to speak in full sentences now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you say Cacique! Izzy I&#39;m a---&#34; Ugh! I growl and back slap him! Ew... I got some skin on my niece jeans!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;UMBROS SERIOUSLY! Patch this up! I&#39;m sure you WILL mate and Mark him ASAP, if I so much as get a whiff of rejection your FUCKED! Adam is VERY serious in learning our ways, you should feel lucky, and he&#39;s a very good driver! Maybe his determination will help you find yours! You&#39;ve always done a half-ass job at almost everything! This is the Goddesses telling you to perk up and do your shit! Did you think we would question the will of the Goddesses?! When in our history has this happened?! I understand that childish mentality coming from outside packs but not from an Osupa. When Lola forgives you so will WE, so make sure that you do an impeccable job of fixing this! COMPRENDES?!&#34; He stumbles up with Maco and Bayo&#39;s help. He composes himself and stands tall, with his head down in shame and submission!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crystal Cacique! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m---&#34; I don&#39;t even want to deal with either him right now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go... NOW.&#34; I dismiss him just above a whisper, feeling my aura growing and I know he sees Aryn. He stumbles a bit again and goes after Lola.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;It feels like it&#39;s going well!&#39; He wants to be funny huh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Papi don&#39;t start, and yup, blood was spilled! Did you know about Adam and Umbros?&#39; I feel his confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What about them?&#39; No matter, Adam is now part of our family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Nothing, I&#39;ll tell you over here and don&#39;t peek in my brain I&#39;m pissed enough as it is!&#39; I feel Deacon laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I surrender my Queen, I&#39;ll just take my sweet time to get there to give you time to cool down! See you in a bit, remember that I love you more than my life!&#39; Dumbass! Either way just him checking in calmed me down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right Nina let&#39;s see the designs you have for the backyard, and what we can do downstairs, ok?&#34; I need something to better my mood.</p>
