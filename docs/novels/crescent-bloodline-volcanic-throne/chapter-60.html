                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t ever want to see that fucking sword again! I feel pain everywhere. But she came for me and Caliburn wanted her dead seducing me with her voice and when I see that the blade wanted to pierce her feeding me lies, telling me she was a vision, to kill her and take Karaya and rule. But her scent was so strong, whatever she did saved me, I would have sliced my own hand if I would have hurt her. Deacon was confused about it all, but it was his primal attachment to Aryn which helped us focus. She even made sure Marcus wasn&#39;t hurt, what did I do to get a mate like her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft knock on my door brings me to my senses, I don&#39;t even want to get up... &#34;Come in.&#34; And of course the cherry to top this day my mate&#39;s jerk brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, um I wanted to apologize for your ordeal today... I am the one who requested Caliburn, I wanted to carry the executions myself... Anyway I didn&#39;t have full understanding of the blade and didn&#39;t think seven more heads would make much of a difference so I just added them on.&#34; I must still be in a stupor! Bayoán is apologizing to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me guess, she came on you hard...&#34; And I can hear him grinding his teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah... She has that way about her... My sweet sister. You&#39;re very lucky you know? My other sisters are... My sisters, but Izzy... Izzy is made of sterner stuff than most people.&#34; I know she is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, she is... And I almost killed her today with a cursed blade.&#34; I say in a tired voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look ma---&#34; He started but I am in no mood for talking anymore. &#34;I accept your apology Beta, it&#39;s over and done, ok?&#34; He nodded and left. I want to doze off and forget this day. There&#39;s a lot I want to forget. The Moon is shining through the window and I feel it lulling me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have dozed a bit but something powerful wakes me up... The scent of pineapples and vanilla! I sit up, I remember her telling me she would see me tonight! Good thing I showered, I put on some jeans, a button shirt and roll up the sleeves, tie my boots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed her scent to the clearing I took her yesterday, and then I saw her, she was standing near the ledge looking out at the Virginia Hills, I could feel from the mate Bond that she was trying to see the ocean. She looked like a vision, she had her Priestess robe on, it was the bright red one and I can see black runes going around the hem in its entirety, the hood covering her midnight colored hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you intend to stare all night?&#34; She asked while she turned to me with those Amber eyes. My lips parted and my spine shivered, she stared so intensely with her perfect poker face, I got chills down the back of neck. I really didn&#39;t know what to answer because I just wanted to continue to stare at her, creepy I know, but she looks like an ethereal creature to be worshipped. All I could do was stare at her while taking a deep breath bobbing my Adam&#39;s apple swallowing hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you allow me My Love, It would be delightful to me to stare at you all night and day.&#34; That&#39;s all the answer I can give her. I have been trying to adapt to her needs just like Keaton had told us before they even arrived. There is no way I think I can go on if she rejects me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blushes so beautifully at my words, and butterflies invade my stomach, and a small smile graces her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continues to look intensely into my own green eyes in silence as if looking for something, her emotions are oozing towards me, she&#39;s looking for honesty in my words. I fear she might find the other things I&#39;m trying to hide, the love, the lust, the need... the secret, I was looking for her to come clean, but NOW? I want this badly, I look at her while lightly licking my lips. Deacon REALLY wants to claim her, I suddenly feel my eyes turn black for a split moment, and I can see by her expression she saw it! Damn it! I blink my eyes as if I had something in them, but I know she saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And suddenly to my surprise she brings down her hood and starts walking my way. I can feel my hands getting clammy, I can feel my heartbeat start to pound faster, and the closer she got, I could hear hers as well. She started to untie her cloak after putting her hood back so that I could see her face entirely. I am BEGGING Deacon to stand down, I let him know that she is making her own move and to allow it and not to ruin it. She keeps walking closely to me her eyes never unlocked from mine and she passes by me with her cloak now in her hands laying it on the ground like a picnic cloth like she did yesterday, she stands again and locked her eyes to my own again, searching. She takes two steps back and I&#39;m able to admire her completely again, she&#39;s wearing a long flowing turquoise skirt with the pattern of large red flowers and a red tank top, her hair loose with strands here and there picked by the wind, she usually has it braided. I have caught into cues of how she likes somethings, like how she likes to wear her hair or how she speaks, the way she sips her coffee. She looks as the Goddess herself! And it is this time she takes a heavy breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She takes my hands in her own studying them, and I just stand there like an idiot just letting her, she touches the calluses on my hands and then I start to examine hers, she&#39;s always shown me she&#39;s not a fragile doll but an Alpha like myself. I can feel what she&#39;s telling me and I&#39;m kind of understanding now what Keaton said about their particular mate Bond. It&#39;s like I know what she wants, what she needs, whether it be to feel better, to be calm, to not be angry. When she allows me to study her own hands she goes back to staring and my own eyes I can&#39;t help myself any longer, I wrap my one arm around her waist bringing her towards me, she yips at that, I can feel her soft breasts press at my chest, she isn&#39;t wearing a bra and I can feel her nipples turn pebble hard. I can definitely smell her arousal... and her Heat! What the hell am I going to do next? I notice a new small Mark on her forehead, I take my free hand and press my thumb to it and I am in an amazing beach, I can feel the breeze. I take my hand away, her eyes full of questions &#34;Did you see it too? Is that Karaya?&#34; She smiles and nods at me. &#34;I wish that we go someday.&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She presses her forehead to my chest and I rake her smooth black hair until my hand is right behind the nape of her neck, she has not moved, and then I can&#39;t take it anymore slowly I move into her lips, but she&#39;s suddenly brings her hand to my chest to stop me. I let out a long breath I did not know I was holding and bowed my head down, I will admit, I feel hurt as hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t misunderstand...&#34; She says that while she takes my face in both of her hands, making me look into her eyes once again and suddenly like a miracle she smiles at me, the type of smile that reaches her eyes my heart is starting to feel full again and suddenly without any warning she pulls my face to her own and kisses me. She kissed me gently, softly, silently, I smell her arousal grow, the smell of pineapples, vanilla, are completely overtaking me. Deacon is howling like if we had reached a home run!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly she breaks the kiss. I feel she is dizzy, and I admit I barely can stand up. She pushes me back a bit without the need to take my hands off of her waist, she reaches down and pulls up her tank top over her head and throws it down with her cloak allowing me to see her breasts and with another swift move she unties her skirt, it&#39;s then when I noticed that the skirt actually wraps around her and then she&#39;s completely naked in front of me and throws her skirt also on top of her cloak. She takes my arm from her waist and steps back to allow me to look at her naked body from top to bottom, she has a slight blush but she doesn&#39;t seem uncomfortable she&#39;s still looking intensely into my eyes and I feel like I&#39;m going to go crazy. I want to jump on her, in her eyes I can tell that&#39;s not what she wants. I cradle my chin holding that arm up while I rest my elbow on my other hand. She allowed me to contemplate her naked body that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m doing, I want to look at every inch of my mate. Deacon is foaming but I am in total control. Except for my own CLEARLY visible erection I am in control, she looks down at it and smiles while licking her lips, she is going to be my demise, and her eyes go again to mine...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ask you again Alpha, do you intend to stare all night?&#34; She didn&#39;t have to tell me twice, well actually she kind of did! It was only a few steps towards her but I breached that gap in an instant and I had her in my arms again, I started kissing her while she was unbuttoning the shirt I had with rolled up sleeves, slowly and her hands slid from the top of my chest to my just above my belt bucle. She traces my abs and reaches for my V crook and I can feel her trace both sides with her fingers. FUCK! My dick is throbbing, I had never felt it this hard! She slides my shirt down my arms while caressing them, making a trail of sparks and just like with the rest of her clothes she puts it on the pile on her cloak, and now it clicked, she was making a small bed out of her cloak. Oh man, this is happening!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At the unfortunate risk of ruining this, I must ask something.&#34; I say as I take a deep breath and break the kiss I looked down at my own feet. I&#39;m breathing heavily here and about to lose control. But if I begin I know I&#39;m going to Mark her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re afraid of marking me without my consent?&#34; She asked so casually as one would ask about the weather, while lifting my head to look at her once again. This woman is going to be the death of me! We haven&#39;t actually done anything and it feels more intense than anything I have ever done with any woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And here I thought I made it quite clear, I must be losing the intuition I thought I had.&#34; She let&#39;s go of my face and her arms fall at her sides as she tells me this, before her arms fall completely I grab them immediately! And I take both of her hands to my lips and kiss them while pulling her towards me again. She was absolutely right! It was my own fear that was stopping me, she had made herself VERY clear. Her skin is so soft I caress her back tracing down to her ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No my lovely mate! Forgive me! You are as clear as day... you&#39;re so beautiful. And I&#39;m still trying to adjust to your culture, I would admit, I&#39;m sorry I did not wait for you for my first. And believe me when I tell you this is the most intimate I have ever been with a woman, and I will also admit that I&#39;m terrified of not being able to feel like this again. I don&#39;t want to fuck it up Loiza, I don&#39;t want to use your pain get what I want, because I most definitely want to claim you right now! And that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m going to do...&#34; I crashed down onto her lips and show her how just how hungry I am for her.</p>
