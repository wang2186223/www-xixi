                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HOLY FUCK! What is going on?! All of the Osupa present are on one knee and a bright light in the middle. I run over with Marcus and my father, as well as every one of our pack members that were near ran over to see what was going on. When we arrive at the center I see my beautiful mate looking like a goddess herself, she is engulfed by a very bright violet light and her eyes are shinning bright white, while The Osupa are chanting Goddess knows what!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!&#34; I ask no one in particular. Their numbers and their chanting has grown so loud I am sure that everyone in our territory can hear it. It&#39;s my father who answers... &#34;Gúarionex had once mentioned this ceremony while we were in the war, we didn&#39;t know if we would survive and neither of us had an heir yet. His father had just died in the war you see, so the Alpha title passed to him immediately since he was the first born and if anything happened to him it would pass to his sister. Yet if there is no heir they go through hierarchy and determine a new dynastic line, The Osupa are CHOOSING their new Alpha and their acceptance is granting her all the powers of a true born Alpha!&#34; And suddenly I feel the power surge through my mate Bond with Loiza, it puts me on my knees it&#39;s so overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yo! Kayden are you ok?!&#34; Marcus wakes from the same trance I was in, looking at the spectacle and my father&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really don&#39;t know how I feel... I am loving this surge of power, yet I also feel Loiza&#39;s  apprehension and fear to become a leader. I start catching my bearings and like a drunk I try to get up, yet this inebriation comes from raw power coming directly from my mate and her pack. I am feeling like I am made of jelly... My poor mate that was unconscious just a little while ago must not be doing so well. Yet when I stand she is standing with a serene face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the ground starts to tremble a bit and one by one thin tornados each made of the elements surround Loiza and I feel an even larger surge of power, but it&#39;s not raw of full of unyielding force. In fact it is soothing and reassuring... &#39;The Goddess herself is Blessing  Mate, she is giding her!&#39; Deacon has been in contact with Aryn since Loiza woke, but he has kept quiet about it until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!&#34; Marcus asks now helping our mother as she is trying to see what&#39;s happening, I notice the shock on her face as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deacon says that her leadership has been accepted and Blessed by the Goddess herself!&#34; Like Marcus and most of the pack, I have never seen a manifestation of the Goddess. &#34;Mom I thought you were with their Luna?&#34; I ask. She is just staring at what is taking place with what looks like...anger? &#34;MOTHER!&#34; I try to snap her out. Her head snaps my way and for a brief moment I notice her eyes, her wolf is there but she quickly takes control again... and for some reason Deacon gave a low growl. Am I going crazy? &#34;Mom, sorry, Deacon is a bit on edge.&#34; &#39;Deacon, what the hell man, it&#39;s MOM!&#39; He doesn&#39;t answer but I feel him become more protective over our mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, are you ok? I said I was sorry, why are you mad?&#34; She looks at both Marcus and me blinking her jade eyes, identical to my own. But she says nothing. And suddenly it all stops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look towards Loiza again, she opens her eyes and they are the same mesmerizing color of amber as before, she drops her hood showing her hair has now a blue shine to her long raven hair and a dewy glow on her alabaster skin. Her Mark is still shinning bright violet and I feel the fear and apprehension that was there before melt away, she steps forward and with her now Alpha voice she gives her leadership declaration: &#34;I am Loiza Mirabal, Cacique and Alpha of The Osupa Pack of Karaya Island, if there is any challenger to my rule step forward and remind your loved ones on how to honor your death!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but gulp and I look at Marcus who can&#39;t stop staring at the scene, but he looks my way with his face full of shock and he points at one of the Osupa closest to Loiza. It&#39;s their Luna who is actually looking at Loiza with pride and starts to undress, we notice that they are all getting naked. The other Priestess goes to my mate and starts undressing Loiza, I get anxious at this, I don&#39;t want anyone to see my mate naked! I start going to where she is to stop this yet her Mark turns yellow and I feel a wave of serenity overtake my panic and anger, I stop and feel Marcus&#39;s hand on my shoulder. The first time I get to see MY MATE naked is with EVERYONE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what I see takes my breath away, her breasts are the perfect fit for my hands, they look so soft and her small pink nipples are calling me, her trim waist and curvy hips are making my mouth water. I know she is feeling my want through the Bond and it&#39;s awakening her own, yet before she allows her arousal to take over she shifts into the most beautiful wolf I have seen! She is all black exept for a white muzzle and white tipped ears, her eyes the color of molten gold.  She gives a long booming houl and the rest of the Osupa shift and join her. The power surge from this makes my spine shiver upwards to the back of my neck making me want to shift and join them! And then I hear a mighty growl come from her and she starts running north with her entire pack behind her. Leaving the rest of us standing there scratching our heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What the hell was that?!&#39; &#39;Have you ever seen anything like that?&#39; &#39;That was some mayor power!&#39; &#39;I kinda want to run with them!&#39; &#39;Is she going to be our Luna? She is a mayor badass!&#39; &#39;Was that the Goddess?&#39; The link of our pack has gone haywire with what they just witnessed. I have no answers for them, I had never witnessed anything like that before. I look to my father: &#34;Is THIS what Alpha Gúarionex said would happen?&#34; I ask him trying to understand what I just saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He never went into detail on how the ceremony takes place.&#34; He is still struck by what he saw like the rest of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a minute, didn&#39;t you say Alpha Gúarionex has a sister, shouldn&#39;t the Alpha title go to her?&#34; Marcus interjects with the same question that has been at the back of my head all this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He did, but she died this morning too... she was Loiza&#39;s mother. And of all of her heirs, the one with the highest hierarchy is Loiza because she is a Priestess of the Goddess, the title passes to her. For The Osupa age and gender are irrelevant, it&#39;s the connection to the Goddess and her will what they follow, and by following her will she grants her Blessings, power, strength, determination, wisdom, these she bestows to her subjects especially the chosen Alpha if he or she is righteous enough... and she made sure everyone saw that she has indeed granted your mate with her Blessing. You must have felt it through the Bond son.&#34; I sure did! I see Marcus looking at me for confirmation, still holding mom, her face empty. What&#39;s with her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did! I still feel it pulsing through my veins! I am still trying to process it right now!&#34; I still feel drunk with it. I tell them as we can still hear the now distant howling of thousands of wolves hailing their new Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But... if she is now Alpha of The Osupa, where does that leave me? I am her mate, will she be my Luna?&#34; At this my mother starts laughing.</p>
