                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blue Moon looks like something out of a dystopian nightmare. The Priestesses really did rain hell here! They&#39;re no guards, the pack house is full of people hiding... When I asked where Marius was they pointed to another building. It was just a brick and concrete square building, no windows to keep out the cold, no door to stop intruders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go in with my men, Josephine came with her team, she named Samuel as her second. He was the fastest to learn her techniques. They were to take to the roof tops and keep eyes and ears open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There is really nothing in the building, just a sort of brick throne were Marius sad drinking and everyone else was on pillows on the floor. A fire in the middle was the only source of heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have some serious balls Kayden! You fucking dare come here after what your cunt mate did? You idiot! Do you know how fucking difficult it is to get unicorns out of Avalon? They&#39;re really shy!&#34; I feel Caliburn calling for his head. Even through the sheath I can hear Mordred&#39;s disgusting voice and his bullshit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re saying you yourself made sure to get them from Avalon? Are you insane Marius?! If you weren&#39;t already cursed you made sure of it!&#34; And he starts laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awe c&#39;mon Kayden it was your pack who bought them from me now wasn&#39;t it?&#34; And he just lays back and crosses has his arms behind his head with a triumphant smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We had no idea what you and those traitors were up to! Who did you sell the unicorn&#39;s blood to?&#34; Marcus asks uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Marcus don&#39;t be like that, the boy that knows his Mommy so very well. I&#39;m sure that looking through all those books in The Council you must have found something that didn&#39;t add up! You should ask your own mother that question... Not many people in The Council want to associate themselves with us do they?&#34; Did mother buy the blood herself?! I feel Marcus&#39;s rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me Kayden, to how many of those silly mating balls were you invited to help you find your mate? Have you any idea how many there were since you and I turned 18? They were quite a lot really! I think I was only invited to two. Were you invited to ANY? Did no one&#39;s Daddy want their little princess to be your Luna? Especially with your own reputation with women? Bravo by the way! The only idiot who didn&#39;t know he was cursed and really didn&#39;t care if he was or wasn&#39;t, was still cursing himself by being a man whore!&#34; Neither Marcus or I have ever been invited to any of those events, they even kept us in the dark about that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I commend you Marcus, you might come out of this unscathed. Sorry Kayden you&#39;re in the same boat as me! There is no way that the Goddess is going to let you keep that hot piece of ass! Don&#39;t think I didn&#39;t see her.&#34; Deacon is alert. My eyes go dark and my canines are out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careful Marius! I won&#39;t allow you to speak about my mate that way again!&#34; I warn him with a growl! And he laughs again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I watched her since they arrived that day... quite a magnificent creature if you ask me. I enjoyed watching you two consummate your sacred Bond from my special observation deck with long sight binoculars. She has an amazing rack by the way, kudos! And by your face you deeply enjoyed every bit of her. My cock got so hard looking at her body writhe with pleasure---&#34; I get to him in an instant and grab his throat ready to rip it to shreds! And he just continues to laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tsk, tsk Alpha, a little bird told me Selene doesn&#39;t want me to keep her company, to Hades you must send me if you even want to HOPE to get her back!&#34; He says with difficulty, I let him drop...FUUUUUCK!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You actually allowed a professional Osupa spy to go inside your mind? You sure are a special kind of stupid, Kayden! You have to be the worlds dumbest cunt! You&#39;re believing them even NOW! I&#39;ll tell you EXACTLY what&#39;s going to happen... and yes I DID have a claimed mate! Guess what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s a fucking Priestess of the Goddess! The moment I turned 20 I visited a pack up North, and like lightning I was struck, WHAM! She was a vision of splendor... One who I am no longer mated to anymore, but I still FEEL her in my arms. I did get to enjoy what it really meant to have a mate for a month, and the fucking... Well I don&#39;t have to tell you Kayden, I at least had mine for a WHOLE MONTH!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t reject me, she is a Priestess after all. Selene herself broke our bond yet I still FEEL her, she has been gifted a second chance mate. I feel her EVERY. SINGLE. TIME she&#39;s fucking him, sometimes all day, and when she&#39;s in Heat... I know that she doesn&#39;t know that she&#39;s hurting me, she must have been assured I would be released from her completely. Is that how your mate is Kayden? Is she a good and devout Priestess? The epitomy of perfection?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beautiful, strong, knowledgeable and a perfect combination of love and scorn. She will never reject you, you know... She will never be disloyal to you. You still FEEL her and feel happy when you feel her through the bond especially if she thinks of you, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am feeling sick right now, it&#39;s EXACTLY what&#39;s happening to me, but I keep my cool...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then one day you don&#39;t have any thoughts of her at all. For a moment you think she&#39;s dead! You feel your heart has been ripped out, you can&#39;t sleep, food makes you sick... HELL even THINKING HURTS! And the next moment you&#39;re in agonizing pain because she&#39;s in ecstasy with another man. And you&#39;re going to feel their fucking joy forever and it will become so excruciating until you become JUST. LIKE. ME!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;EVERY FUCKING TIME THEY FUCK IT&#39;S LIKE A THOUSAND DAGGERS! I pray to that BITCH Selene everyday that Avalon will come and strike me down, DO YOU HEAR ME SELENE YOU FUCKING CUNT! I CURSE YOUR FUCKING NAME! I have nothing to lose. Do you have to have something to lose Kayden?&#34; Moira said I could get her back! Is THIS what&#39;s to happen to me? To become an insane rabid dog?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying they promised you could have her back and they cut your bond and gave her to someone else?&#34; He has to be lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise?! I wasn&#39;t promised shit! They just took MY MATE like thieves in the night and gave her to someone else! They wanted me to know what it meant to want and love something so much and they TOOK HER FROM ME! Just like they will take your raven haired beauty and give her to another... I hear Karaya has more than tripled it&#39;s numbers by adding SEVEN packs to their ranks, even vampires! I can only imagine the conditions put on their Alpha for the deal to be sealed.&#34; I haven&#39;t felt any arousal, desire or want from Loiza for any other man after the period of the great confusion she felt for the man with turquoise eyes. And that passed quite a while ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t felt anything that would make me doubt my mate.&#34; I state with confidence... I KNOW she loves me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We shall see Kayden...&#34; And he takes a shot of what I can smell is rum. And he gives me a wide smile. &#34;Do you know Karaya makes some of the best rum? Yo ho, ho, the pirate&#39;s life for me!&#34; And more laughing. I start feeling sympathy for this motherfucker! I see some of who I was in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you try getting a witch for a mate block?&#34; I ask. This can&#39;t be my fate. He gives his maniacal annoying as fuck laugh again...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since my curse comes from Selene herself any witch who interferes can call herself cursed too. And even if you have all the gold in the world, Priestesses of Avalon are not running to join the ranks of The Cursed Roses... well except for your Mommy, she seems to really WANT it, dumb cunt!&#34; Damn, even Marius knows about The Cursed Roses! I was so in the dark...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew I was cursed when I did the things I did! Did I get some bitches to get their pups aborted? Fuck yeah! Why would I pass on this misery? I heard a little rumor that some dumb bitch gave up her true mate, aborted their baby and you welcomed her merrily into your bed and THEN you took her head... isn&#39;t that like the saying &#39;calling the kettle black&#39; Kayden?&#34; I hate him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True, but I didn&#39;t know Vanessa had done that until after I booted her out of my bed! I didn&#39;t make her do anything and yeah, I took her head, I won&#39;t have slavers in my pack.&#34; He can&#39;t stop laughing! I can&#39;t stand his laughing! I try to mute it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, my mother loved telling me the story of how the stupidity of your Mommy had basically cursed all of us and that you two were just growing up in a fantasy bubble without knowing how really screwed you were.&#34; I look at Marcus and he looks back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is true, too... yet that stupid woman says your father got paid by The Council so that you&#39;re pack got some recognition and money, just because your father confirmed Karaya&#39;s location. That sounds like a dumb cunt, too.&#34; So he was cursed by just confirming the location my mother gave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just because he was there Avalon shunned him too! My father never found his true mate! That was his punishment from Avalon. And he loved to tell my mother about it, loudly and often, and that&#39;s what I grew up with! That was part of my curse! Your parents are true mates and were absolutely compatible for each other in every way! That&#39;s why you had the lovey-dovey super happy childhood you had! Even though your parents are psychopaths partially responsible for attempted GENOCIDE! And then your mate ends up becoming the Queen of the pack that your parents helped try to eliminate! This just writes itself! And here I thought my story was sad!&#34; And now others of his pack just find all of this hysterical. They are all mad!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus you probably won&#39;t find your true mate either! Wouldn&#39;t that be splendid! To have what you wanted to feel the most, will be the thing you will never get, just like your big brother and I! We love the ladies and then we get a taste of what THE REAL THING feels like, just to have it be taken away... It&#39;s poetic don&#39;t you think?&#34; And a beautiful girl in just a thong brings him a drink and sits on his lap giggling and he massages her ass while taking a drink. Then with a smirk he starts suckling at her breast, he puts his drink on the table next to his chair while the girl lowers his zipper and starts giving him a handjob, he smacks her ass and she gets on her knees and takes him with her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dude you&#39;re absolutely sick what&#39;s wrong with you?&#34; Marcus asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean what&#39;s wrong with me? I have a beautiful woman sucking my cock! I live my life like everyday is the last Marcus, you should try it once in a while! It&#39;s really possible, it will be for the both of you!&#34; Marius is insane. And he seriously doesn&#39;t want pups or a family because he doesn&#39;t want to curse anybody else to his misery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Are we seriously meant to be miserable forever?&#39; Marcus asks me, he looks devastated. I can&#39;t allow this! I&#39;ve been a complete asshole but Marcus has always been a straight arrow. How can the Goddess not grant him his mate? Marius has his head lying back moaning and enjoying the blowjob, everyone around us is slowly getting ready for what looks like an orgy. Marcus looks sick and I am not willing to end up like Marius. I take a deep breath and focus on her, I have the lock of her hair she left behind in the little bag prepared by the Endora with the herbs to enhance her scent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a deep breath of her hair, I split off two small precious pieces and put each inside my nostrils, I breathe in and her scent is present. I hold Caliburn and unsheathed him and the voice of Mordred is once again in my head but I am focused, Mordred is calling loudly to me in her voice, but I deny him to get in my head... I don&#39;t know how long I can hold so I proceed to taking Marius&#39;s head. The girl who was blowing him starts screaming and instead of Mordred I hear another voice, one I have heard before and she tells me which heads to take. Marcus, Gabriel, Avis, Adam, Frank, Leo, they all shift but I link them to go outside and round up those who are innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, almost everyone in that room is an Unwanted by the Goddess, I feel protection from Caliburn and it&#39;s pull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Do what you must Kayden, she needs you, the time will come when your loyalty and courage will be rewarded. Feed the light.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end of it over 250 heads were off and I am in complete control, Caliburn is quiet. I feel a burning sensation on the wrist of my left hand, the hand holding Caliburn and it turns into a circle with a cross from top to bottom and left to right. And as fast as it came, the pain was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Take the innocent with you, you will show this Mark to Moira and every head you have taken here today, you will tell her that who gave you this Mark commands you claim Caliburn as YOUR blade. As long as you bear this Mark, it will never corrupt you, your mate or any heir of your blood.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So she IS my mate? She won&#39;t be taken?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**We will talk more you and I about Loiza, these people here need you now. Focus.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have two more heads to take, it fills me with dread, but I feel like something more important waits for me and to reach it this thing must be done.</p>
