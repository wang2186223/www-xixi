                <p>Suania&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the youngest of 6 children it&#39;s always easy to be overlooked. I wasn&#39;t a Beta or a Priestess or a Master Engineer, but I was the fastest, the silent one who could by masking my scent knew the secrets no one usually cared to be vigilant of. I know of everything going around, I know Izzy visits The Catacombs as often as she can, I know she talks with someone there. I know Bayoán thought Izzy would be an easy Alpha to advise to and that Moira thought she could be controlled. I know that Ura and by default as his Twin Soul Freya miss Izzy. I know Nina&#39;s anger at Daddy and Bayoán comes from restrictions placed by them and Maco... He has always been the peace keeper but now is working on helping Amelia. We need him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the good thing about being overlooked is that I can appear and disappear at will. I never really cared about finding my mate, all I cared about was to live like I wanted. I was scared we would die when My. Cemí exploded and when Mami died I felt lost. She was my main mentor as Daddy was Maco&#39;s, Bayo&#39;s and Izzy&#39;s. And it was to her I told every secret I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when I found Nasser I was full of comfort that someone was REALLY looking at ME, that I had someone to whom to share my secrets with and not betray me. I just KNEW. I had heard that the Bond works different for everyone and the moment I saw him I knew what he needed and vise versa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brought him home that same night. Izzy didn&#39;t mind, but I could already hear Bayoán&#39;s shit through the Link, ever since he became Beta he was no fun at all! He had basically turned into Daddy, lucky for me Izzy told him to back off. We give each other smack but Izzy is a badass when it comes to protecting us, and since becoming the Ultimate Alpha I thought she would be a snotty bitch, but she seems lonely. And what she did for us is something our pack will never forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of my Kappa friends who work in music are writing a ton of songs about her power, about the first Cacique in over a century, but most of all they are writing songs about her sad love story. Izzy has been in a daze the past weeks so she doesn&#39;t know how much the pack is hurting for her. They know she has a Block, but before everything happened Izzy served as comfort to many who visited her Temple so she was known by basically all the pack and loved by everyone. For a time I was jealous of the attention she received, but her days where long and when I realized all the responsibility she had and felt sorry for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she gave up her mate for us I was angry at the Goddess! If someone who had dedicated herself to Selene, who was able to pass every test our parents gave her, especially Daddy, someone who trained so hard with little to no bitching, it made me start hating Selene. Izzy never wanted power, even Mami and Isla would say she yearned for love. Yet it was power what Selene gave her. Ura is mad too... shit he&#39;s livid, it was no secret that Izzy was his favorite. And now that she granted my mate I was conflicted myself, it was so fast... I have no idea how Izzy kept taking in more stupid responsibilities and still control herself around her mate. Sure we are taught self control but damn if I care!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment we walked into The Fort Bayoán was waiting to interrogate Nasser, ugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing bringing in a stranger here?!&#34; He was pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Izzy interjected with as much patience as she could: &#34;Dude what is your problem? This is standard, Maco just took Amelia to our old house the moment she woke up, would you have had this attitude with her?! It&#39;s her MATE for Goddess sake and this is her home too!&#34; His eyes were the golden color of Nicodemus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nicodemus STAND DOWN NOW!&#34; Izzy commanded with her bitchin Alpha voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s too young! Father would hav--&#34; He started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you haven&#39;t noticed BETA, father isn&#39;t here, get it into your fucking brain that he is DEAD and it&#39;s not YOUR place to bitch about anyone&#39;s mate! You did what you wanted with Moira and no one gave you shit! You found your mate and she was greeted with open arms. Get it in your head right NOW that you ARE NOT THE HEAD OF THIS FAMILY, I AM! Who the FUCK do YOU THINK YOU ARE! I AM ALPHA HERE! Have you lost your damn mind?! You want to be father? Would father EVER speak to Alpha Gúarionex like you do to me?! You&#39;re being a chauvinistic asshole! You AND father denied Nina to go abroad after she passed her tests but came with the excuse that she was a Kappa. You BOTH wanted to do the same to ME, but neither had a chance to give me that bullshit excuse because I CREAMED BOTH of you at the same time! You have become something other than the brother that used to make me laugh till I cried since becoming Beta. I placed you there because I trust your judgement, did I make a mistake? If I did tell me now and I will do what you wanted and find someone else! I am sick of this! I have given EVERYTHING to this pack! My childhood, my freedom even my happiness and it&#39;s still not enou---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy shit, Izzy falls to her knees and can&#39;t stop crying and hyperventilating, there were already people out of their rooms and offices looking at the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayoán screams for Daniella and Tía Ayiti tells Morgana to take Bayoán away but he refuses and Ura and Braka push him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck is wrong with you man?!&#34; Ura shoves Bayo super pissed! Not again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Braka forget about him now, take the Alpha to her rooms!&#34; Isla commands as Daniella goes to her taking her pulse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morgana is livid &#34;We have talked about THIS what is wrong with you? Where the FUCK is my mate?!&#34; And she slaps him right there. &#34;Snap of it! She&#39;s pregnant and mate less! You were so afraid of her snapping, well congratulations, there it is! Find somewhere else to sleep tonight BETA!&#34; And she goes to Izzy&#39;s room chanting something and I take Nasser&#39;s hand and follow Morgana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Braka lays Izzy on her bed and Daniella goes to work. Isla is laying on the other side of the bed praying holding Izzy&#39;s left hand. Izzy is just crying uncontrollably and suddenly... CRACK! A thunderstorm starts and we hear the waves getting stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For fucks sake! Nia, link Ayana to port every Priestess on the island here NOW! I&#39;ll go to that asshole and tell him to summon Moira!&#34; I do as Ura says and the wind picks up! And the fire pit lights up. Nina walks in and goes next to Isla to pray with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Priestesses arrive just as water funnels are forming outside! BIG ones! Sumayah goes to the balcony to ease the ocean and Daniella makes room for Yaya, Ayana and Cressy. Izzy&#39;s Mark is giving this weird black shine that veins out of her Mark. The wind gets so strong that it blows out the fire!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her power is manifesting itself through the ocean! Water has always been her strongest element, SHE HAS TO CALM DOWN!&#34; Sumayah yells. She&#39;s a PRIME Priestess and she&#39;s having trouble calming down the ocean but she was able to get rid of the funnels!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy, listen to my voice, focus your Mark, c&#39;mon Loiza you have the power to shut this down.&#34; Yaya says calmly as Ayana and Cresta start chanting turning their Marks yellow. Yet the funnels start up again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I am in Nasser&#39;s arms holding on for dear life and he is shushing me still his heartbeat steady, helping me calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will be fine love, our Alpha is going through so much but she loves her people. She&#39;s just upset but she won&#39;t hurt us.&#34; He says it calmly yet loud enough so that everyone, including Izzy hears. I look at him like I just saw him anew! By the Goddess! He says exactly everything that needs to be said in the right tone! I AM Blessed! Someone to soothe my fears... I have so many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Tía Ayiti comes in the room, I feel Bayo in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck THIS!&#34; Tía pushes through everyone and gets to Izzy and she takes Isla&#39;s thumb and makes her lick it! What is she doing? But Isla obeys and Tía takes Isla&#39;s thumb to Izzy&#39;s forehead Mark and it shines green and everything is still and Izzy passes out. &#34;Keep it there!&#34; And she goes to Bayoán and slaps him HARD.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the FUCK is wrong with you boy?! What happened to your training? Your father&#39;s teachings? MY TEACHINGS?!&#34; And he looks lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniella goes to work again to check on Izzy and the babies. And suddenly Phoebe is in front of Bayo, her wings are fucking GLOWING and her eyes are white and puts her hands on Bayo&#39;s head...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deamon hinc abite! Et non est tibi. Cui placet impares formas quas eieci te ut Cerberum altera prandium!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he falls unconscious to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morgana goes to him...&#34;What happened? A demon?&#34; Phoebe&#39;s eyes and wings go back to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I read something strange in him since Blood Moon, but couldn&#39;t pin point it till now. He had a daeva inside, nasty creatures that promote chaos and disorder.&#34; She says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He had it in him all this time?&#34; Morgana asks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this another attack from The Council?&#34; Ura asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I sensed something not right when I saw him but don&#39;t know how or when it came in, they take hold silently and can live in a host for years without being detected, I doubt very much that The Council did this...&#34; She goes to Izzy and studies her forehead more closely. Moira finally showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ayiti, it&#39;s very lucky that you have so much knowledge of the gods.&#34; And Phoebe passes her hand over the Mark with out touching it and it turns green again. &#34;Selene is not the only Goddess watching over our Queen, The Great Mother is guiding her. I strongly recommend erecting shrines to Gaia. You say that water is The Alpha&#39;s main element, not fire?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was always particular to water over her natural element of fire as a Gamma.&#34; Moira points out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you never found that strange?&#34; Phoebe asks. &#34;Did you never think on investigating this anomaly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She mastered all the tests with equal skill.&#34; Moira says with that fucking dead voice of her, trying to be all creepy and shit! Phoebe scoffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Incompetent, I&#39;ll investigate myself! Don&#39;t fret Daniella she will be herself when she wakes, so will the Beta. There&#39;s something bigger looking for her but because of her Priestess Mark and then the one on her forehead they can&#39;t and won&#39;t be able to see her, and being at Blood Moon with so much negative energy... That&#39;s when I imagine it took the Beta. Morgana, go to Morgaine&#39;s book and search for daevas and verify if there&#39;s a particular symbol for protection against them. Everyone who is near the Alpha, even myself, must carry it at all times, I suggest getting it tattooed. Also where&#39;s the gold medallion she wears?&#34; Nina goes to the closet and gets it and hands it to Phoebe. And she studies it. &#34;Ayiti, who is the Goddess in the middle and these symbols?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the middle is the Goddess Atabex and this symbol is the coquí frog, you know the one that sings at night? And this is the sun.&#34; The smaller symbols interlapse surrounding Atabex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Atabex is Goddess of what?&#34; Phoebe asks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Tía Ayiti sits putting it together...&#34;Of the Earth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So basically another representation of Gaia. I recommend that this medallion be tattooed on the Alpha&#39;s back.&#34; She says. She keeps looking at the Guanín &#34;The sun... why do warewolves have the symbol for the sun on their symbol for royalty?&#34; She says whispering to herself, but we can all hear clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why on her back?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To watch it... The term &#39;Watch your back&#39; has meaning among the fae. Usually if being persecuted we will tattoo enchantments on our back to watch it. The elves do this too. That&#39;s why The Lady Moira wears them on her head and arms and bet my wings she DOES have one on her back.&#34; We all look at Moira and she nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who could be looking for her?&#34; Ura asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phoebe goes to the balcony and looks at the now still sea... &#34;No idea, but like I said, I will investigate.&#34; And she keeps looking at the sea. &#34;The vanity of pure elves will be the demise of the species.&#34; And she gives Moira a daring glare and walks out.</p>
