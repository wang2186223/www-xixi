                <p>chapters in Washington and New York combined, it took us some up and downs but we got to the right meeting room at the large amphitheater. We were to sit at the middle center and right at 2:02 p.m. London time a massive portal opened right at the center and out she walked with a tight white cocktail dress to her calves, with spaghetti straps white pumps that made her look even taller, a fine white leather coat to match it. Her hair was done in a beautiful braid adorned with white pearls, she also wore earrings with a big pearl on each ear, the gold medallion on her neck, I almost couldn&#39;t see it, but she wasn&#39;t covering MY Mark. I can&#39;t stop looking how beautiful she looked it was painful to know that my eyes haven&#39;t seen her in so long I want to go to her and she locks eyes with mine and I feel it&#39;s just us among all that people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza, love I know you can hear me. We need to talk!&#34; And Bayoán and some other dude, is he ALSO her Beta? Covered her from me, more people are coming out from the portal and Moira walks out all in white as the day I first saw her. I see others I&#39;ve met before, and I could feel the strong aura of the entourage. Moira raises her hand making all of us sit, and there were tables in front of us with an official leather bound declaration of war to The Council. It contained detailed forensic evidence, confessions including that of Chairman Tiago. Everyone was murmuring and trying to talk over each other yet a hologram projector popped up with Chairman Tiago telling everything and two more protectors pop up with what look like massive attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, I am Alpha Loiza, Cacique of The Osupa, thank you for your time. What you are witnessing are coordinated attacks against Luna Llena de la Sombra in Uruguay, who had around 3,000 members and Única Lua do Céu, in Brazil, they had over 4,600 members. These are not packs in the hundreds but in the thousands, they are considered by Council standards as medium to large packs, correct? Look at the time stamps ladies and gentlemen, did YOUR pack get attacked on that day at that precise time? What mindless rogues in these numbers can coordinate attacks like these? The answer is NONE! In the documents in front of you lay every detail of the charges against The Warewolf High Council for the crimes of treason, conspiracy to commit treason, genocide and crimes against the warewolf world in general. I Alpha Loiza Mirabal, Cacique of Karaya Island and High Priestess of Avalon acuse you directly Chairman Armand, Chairman Claude, Chairman Farrow, Chairman Elizabeth and Chairman Ibrahim of murder, slavery, rape and the corruption of countless Priestesses, taking from the Goddess Selene herself those who serve her!&#34; The Lady Moira throws a frozen head front and center and looks at me to do the same as she instructed...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right yeah put me on the spot! &#39;This is good dummy! WE get the credit in front of our mate, Aryn says she doesn&#39;t know!&#39; Deacon tells me, hell yeah! After seeing her I don&#39;t care what heads I put before her! I get up and get closer and her scent is just as strong, I try to catch a glimpse of her eyes again and I did for a SECOND when someone gets in my way! Seriously?! I throw the heads out of the bowling ball bags we were carrying, probably Adam&#39;s dumbest plan to date! But I saw her reaction, by the Goddess her dimples! She thinks it&#39;s funny! Moira goes off on a rant about The Cursed Roses I didn&#39;t care for, and pushed through were she was and I took her wrist and grabbed her face with my other hand and kissed her, MINE! She grabbed hold of my collar with the hand of the wrist that I grabbed, just when I was going to leave her hand and take her waist I hear a Smith &amp; Wesson .500 being cocked right at my head. I open my eyes to see her smiling face with her eyes opening, her blush and goosebumps matching my own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very romantic Goldilocks, but take your hands off our Alpha please, you wouldn&#39;t want me getting her pretty white dress all nasty with your blood right?&#34; I wanted to rip him apart! And she scoffs and goes forward passing by me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let this be a warning for EVERYONE here! Should any member BELONGING TO THIS REIGNING BODY or associates dare come near my Island, there will be open season on all of you and to ensure you understand that I always mean what I say!&#34; Those whom she mentioned earlier were lifted from their seats and I saw the Mark on her forehead shine red as well as her eyes and I look at the upper benches for those she mentioned and she blows their entire bodies, their blood looking like blobs in cero G! Some gasped, some screamed, some started heading out the doors. Her eyes met me again with hurt in then. No, no, NO!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Code name Baby Face, are you ready to come home?&#34; She says looking downwards. Baby Face?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Goddess Alpha I thought you would never ask! I&#39;m sick of talking in this fucking annoying voice!&#34; And Josephine gets up and opens her &#39;purse&#39; and starts assembling a different sniper rifle and this one looks way more modern than the one she had!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious right now?&#34; And she comes over and smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a pleasure giving you my Alpha&#39;s gift! You have the best trained Epsilons outside Karaya, they could be better if they didn&#39;t complain about EVERYTHING! I also left some extras in my apartment, get your best techs on those.&#34; She was spying ON ME?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seriously had a spy inside MY PACK?!&#34; I ask her pissed but kinda flattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Víctor do you mind putting that down! Kayden I just wanted to make sure you were ok and look! You are!&#34; Council Warriors start shifting and Víctor and fucking Baby Face go to work as others do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is our queue Alpha time to go!&#34; Everyone starts returning to the portal, Leo comes over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss this is pandemonium we got to leave now!&#34; I look at her again, I can&#39;t leave without her, I need to touch her again! And we are now stuck in cross fire and the portal closes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SHIT! Are you kidding me! What are they doing?!&#34; The one called Víctor asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I new we shouldn&#39;t have used a portal.&#34; Urayoán says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit happens, that&#39;s why we always have a Plan B. Ura, change to tactical.&#34; Loiza says as she places a device in her ear. &#34;Joey, signal your new buddies, they won&#39;t be able to get out the front... Head do you copy? I don&#39;t care what happened just find us a way out&#34; She inputs some data into what I thought was her phone. And zips up her coat. &#34;Online, tactical gear, codename The Raven.&#34; And everything she has on turned into a white leather cat suit. &#34;Joey, did you guys go to Tommy for the fitting?&#34; And &#39;Joey&#39; smiles. Her codename is The Raven?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Duh! Ole Tommy&#39;s the man! These were bitching about the price!&#34; And she pats me on the shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you calling me cheap?!&#34; They&#39;re all smiling like we&#39;re not in the middle of crossfire here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey bro in law or whatever! Have you felt as if you have gotten shot? These ain&#39;t stormtroopers ok, they don&#39;t miss for fan service, you are basically wearing armor against silver dude, so next time you meet up with Tommy you pay AND leave a bitchin tip!&#34; Damn! And it is a nice suit too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha there is roof access through here, The Head is sending coordinates to a UH-60 Black Hawk with a new rendezvous.&#34; Víctor says. That&#39;s a helicopter right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok we all fit, Lola you have left chair, don&#39;t even stat Ura I need you and Joey at the other side! Víctor, I need you at the 50-cal, Susana I need you backing Víctor. The rest of you don&#39;t lag and don&#39;t get shot! Move out!&#34; Don&#39;t get shot?! She&#39;s treating us like pups and Marcus gives me a look! &#39;Is this really HAPPENING?!&#39; She signals Víctor to go ahead she gets her own gun with a scope. And signals us behind her to follow. &#39;Marcus LOOK at them! They&#39;re not worried!&#39; They all look in their element, they look so comfortable doing this, her brother has a bow and he&#39;s smiling from ear to ear, Josephine looks like she&#39;s with those she can truly trust will have her back. And my beautiful Raven, looks like she&#39;s about to jump of a slide!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lola: &#34;Izzy, we have motion in the two sections to the left ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loiza: &#34;Copy that, Víctor, Susana greet the first group, Joey, you and Ura get group two. Lola we have a Black Hawk to jack, Blood Moon, follow us and match our speed.&#34; And she looks at me. &#34;Do you copy?&#34; I just nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We follow Loiza and Lola to the stairwell that leads to the roof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you see it Iz?&#34; Loiza looks at her pad. And puts it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup, but we can smell them too, and the civilians are wearing Tommy&#39;s gear, this should be fun cousin, ready?&#34; We&#39;re civilians?! She looks at me. &#34;You stay here and wait for my signal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready Izz!&#34; Lola answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both run up and we hear gunfire and someone is thrown over the rails, we look up but the rest of the group shows up behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re the signal, let&#39;s go!&#34; Josephine leads us up and there must be at least 20 bodies there! They go to the exit. And Izzy is powering it up on the right side and her cousin on the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy that was too fucking easy!&#34; Ura says as he gets on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is it that whenever we do get lucky you have to go right in and jinx it?! It&#39;s annoying as fuck and I blame every single wrong thing that happens now on your ass!&#34; She says as she starts this thing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just make sure you don&#39;t crash this one!&#34; He says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please, everyone KNOWS that was my brother&#39;s fault! I still don&#39;t know how the fuck he passed his test! Ura, man sometimes I don&#39;t get that we&#39;re kin.&#34; Lola says. They all laugh finding it hysterical. But we&#39;re off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you Ura, remember when we had to leave Karachi ASAP, who fucked that up?! What&#39;s the rendezvous Víctor?&#34; Loiza asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey I don&#39;t get any shit for the Karachi mission, Suania fucked all of us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you two shut the fuck up! It&#39;s like being with Natalia and Umbros!&#34; Lola says and Víctor clears his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stonehenge, Alpha! They can use the magical energy there to port us back!&#34; Víctor says over the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to drop them off first!&#34; Loiza says. NO!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please let us go with you!&#34; I go next to her. &#34;Please love, let--&#34; Are we getting shot?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha we have incoming at 5 o&#39;clock!&#34; The one called Susana I think, said. Loiza looks at me and pushes me with the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many?! Evasive maneuvers hold on everyone!&#34; I look back at--Holy Hades!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks like more than a few... Izzy you may have made them mad blowing up those assholes!&#34; Lola says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heat seeking missiles drones Izzy!&#34; Her brother says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On it!&#34; So she fucking turns off the DAMN helicopter and shoots a fireball as far as possible, making them blow and turns the helicopter on again! She&#39;s insane!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For fucks sake Izzy! You did the Johannesburg trick! Why do you love using it you fucking promised last time!&#34; Her brother complains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it works every time and I know you hate it! We don&#39;t have time for this! Ura take the fucking cylic!&#34; What&#39;s going on? Her brother takes the chair she was just in and she jumps out. Adam and Jason gasp and I almost lose my shit! However she landed on a platform of wind, she waits until we are far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What will happen to her?!&#34; I ask. Her brother smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dude, chill! This isn&#39;t her first rodeo and she wasn&#39;t a High Priestess then!&#34; She takes a stance and lights up both of her hands and sends it streaming to every single drone coming our way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lola, I didn&#39;t find any tracking did you?!&#34; She catches the landing gear and hops back on with Víctor catching her hand and pulling her inside like this is just another day for them. Josephine came later, but they didn&#39;t need a plan or hours to choose the right team, everyone knew what to do, who&#39;s instructions to follow, they looked confident in who they were working with. If this is a snippet of what they can do, the rest of us are just jokes. Loiza goes to the cock pit and finds a tracker under a box under Lola&#39;s chair which she burns on the spot. She links some instructions and she finally sits looking at me and I go sit by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t do this... Please Kayden, don&#39;t do this.&#34; I feel my Adam&#39;s apple go up and down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?! You&#39;re my mate DAMN IT! ---I want to be by your side, please let me be by your side Love.&#34; I whisper the last part in her ear. I put my face in the crock of her neck where I know my Mark is and lower the zipper of her suit and expose it, I caress it with my thumb I go to it with my mouth. The scent coming from it already making me hard for her, and I kiss it and she melts on me. I want her right there, something is making her scent stronger. She wraps one arm around my neck and puts one hand to my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I need my head very clear now, give me time, please don&#39;t do this to me!&#34; I don&#39;t want to let go of her and I know she doesn&#39;t want to let go either. Has she forgiven me? And I feel her let me go. FUCK! I lift my eyes to find hers but she&#39;s looking away.</p>
