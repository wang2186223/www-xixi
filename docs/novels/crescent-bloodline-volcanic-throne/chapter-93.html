                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turns out that Víctor&#39;s mate is in fact The Lady Magdalena, the Priestess of Luna Llena, this just gets better! As the only Priestess in The Fort, I tended to the shrines in the gardens, but I couldn&#39;t serve as it&#39;s Guardian. Over due Alpha here!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she was honored to serve as Guardian and then she saw what she was taking on. Víctor wanted to see her face when she saw the 4 acres of gardens that surrounded the Shrines. He still hasn&#39;t chosen an apartment because when he told me who his mate was and I told him that I would name her Guardian he wanted her to choose from an apartment with view to the city, the sea or with view of the gardens. He had completely adapted for her! I still just found it weird. And yet... Would he have been like that if...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Goddesses&#39;s mercy! Is THIS what I shall be guarding?!&#34; Her eyes were sparkling and Víctor&#39;s smile matched her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup! All 4 acres of it! I imagine Víctor has told you why there are two shrines instead of just one?&#34; She sits on the quartz bench in the middle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Alpha he has! To have also the Blessings of the Great Mother herself! This truly is a magnificent place, I am so grateful to the Goddesses for gifting me Víctor who brought us here.&#34; And she goes to his arms and he wraps his arms around the slender girl with curves in the right places, who is almost a foot shorter than him, with deep brown long straight hair and olive green eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So amada, which do you prefer? View to the sea or the gardens you will guard?&#34; It was making me a little jealous, Block or no, I yearned for my mate. And this was Víctor...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Víctor, I could be here all day! Let&#39;s get one where I can see it always please!&#34; She went to to the everblooming blue flamboyán tree between the Shrines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha?&#34; Víctor asks making me chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already told you to pick yourselves, I&#39;m not your real estate agent Beta!&#34; I explained to Magdalena the particulars for the care for Gaia&#39;s shrine since she already knew what to do for the one for Selene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll get her brothers and mine to help us move today!&#34; I kept looking at the coral stone sundial, we were to meet with Pasha in a few minutes. They had made several deposits in their account of the same size as the first and I had some last minute requests for their rings and we were to deliver them today. I wasn&#39;t caring about what I wore, I had a marine blue long sleeve, long linen tunic with v-neck front and back with a bright gold line down the middle and my hair was braided. That&#39;s it, no Guanín, not even underwear, I wanted these pups out and was anxious to meet them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Magdalena, have you ever met a mermaid before?&#34; And she gave me curious eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Alpha as you know there are mermaids in Avalon yet they always stayed by Arthur&#39;s Island.&#34; She&#39;s one year older than me, I think I remember her but I mostly hung out with Ayana and Cressy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure Víctor won&#39;t mind waiting a bit longer to move in for you to meet our mermaids, right?&#34; And we both look at Víctor. He smiles at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If my lovely Lady wishes to see mermaids who am I to say no.&#34; Ok I am totally weirded out by this, but I am loving the power she has over him, it&#39;s like she has literally tamed the wolf!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok then, Maco is at the Lagoon and Beta, it&#39;s good for you as well to meet the richest partial citizens of Karaya.&#34; Now I&#39;m the one who can&#39;t wait to see their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you say Alpha.&#34; We go through the gates that lead to the lagoon and I start feeling a little strange. I take a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha?&#34; Víctor lets go of Magdalena and helps steady me. I tap his hand gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine Beta, no need to fuss! I&#39;m good.&#34; And he goes back to his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there is Maco and Gadiel and their new apprentices from different places, with many little crates with over four dozen mermaids in the lagoon. I hear Magdalena gasp at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maco is already explaining the debit system to them, he already gave Sybil a tutorial on everything so she was helping him serve as kind of a brand model to show the features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides the debit and communication system I asked them to add our internet system. I wanted them to learn as much about us and what was happening in the island. They had actually participated in interviews, so I wanted them to have access to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok guys, so if you want to know of events happening, videos of the news, interviews, movies, shows and music, maps of the island and the waterways to reach those places and information on the outside world and their media, tell them what to do Sybil!&#34; And Sybil goes to the center of the lagoon and says &#34;Open Web.&#34; Into her ring. Out pops up a hologram projector, &#39;Online.&#39; The ring answers. And the mermaids gasp in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on Sybil, tell it what you want to see!&#34; And she looks so giddy! And I feel a bit woozy again, but I let it be. Instead I walk closer to the shore so my feet are in the water and it helps me feel better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show me list of mermaid interviews for Solstice Festival.&#34; Sybil commands the ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Searching.&#39; The ring responds and It pops up several options on the hologram projector.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Sybil, which one do you want to see? You know what to do!&#34; She&#39;s bitting her bottom lips with a huge grin and she touches the the hologram and chooses one and an interview of one of the mermaids starts playing. And they gasp and start laughing, a few say:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look! It&#39;s you Coralia!&#34; And a mermaid with orange hair and multicolor fins resembling a parrot fish goes next to Sybil to see her interview and ekks. &#34;It&#39;s me! Find another!&#34; Pasha looks at me with a gleaming smile and I walk a little deeper into the water drawn by their excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys can search for more later, Sybil keep showing them!&#34; And she looks back and nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show me how to get to waterfalls from the sea!&#34; She commands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Searching.&#39; The ring says again. And it shows many inland waterfalls you can reach by swimming up several rivers and where to find the river&#39;s delta. And I feel very wet, I look down at my tunic and it looks like I peed myself! I get into the water and I can already feel the first contraction and WHOA! I go deeper and it&#39;s making me feel better yet still I&#39;m not liking it. Pasha does notice and swims to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong Loiza? Is it time?&#34; I just nod trying to calm my breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maco! It&#39;s the Alpha! The pups are coming!&#34; She shouts. Each of her entities take each of my arms and their other hand to the small of my back. She puts my arms around her necks and she places her free hands on my stomach and I feel a wave of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep breathing wolf sister, we are here with you.&#34; It feels so good in the water, it feels... Right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone must have linked Daniella and her team. Isla, Tía, my siblings, Phoebe, by the Goddesses how many people did they call?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Highness, bring her to shore please!&#34; I hear Daniella shout. But I don&#39;t want to go to shore!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Pasha! It feels good here!&#34; And I feel another contraction but Pasha rubs my belly and I&#39;m relaxed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wants to stay inside the water!&#34; Phoebe tells them. And Isla comes to me getting all wet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take this side Luna, I will calm her mind.&#34; Isla follows instructions and the dark side of Pasha puts her hands to my temples and I feel so much better that I barely feel the next contraction. Daniella gets in the water and comes over, too! She goes underwater to check on how dilated I am. She raises my tunic to my thighs and comes up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, we are at already six centimeters, they are in a hurry!&#34; She says and calls Estefanía to instruct her on a water birth. Every time I feel a contraction my body tenses but Pasha helps keep me calm and my eyes are closed remembering to breathe yet feeling pretty ok.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Their coming fast mija keep breathing, stay calm.&#34; I don&#39;t think I would be this calm if I wasn&#39;t in the water. And I feel the next contraction, yet before it hits hard I feel Pasha soothing my mind. Inhale. Estefanía goes under to check and Sybil goes with her. Nina gets in the water to record it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy you are doing awesome! Your making it look so easy.&#34; She says. Exhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Estefanía comes up...&#34;She&#39;s at eight centimeters Master! They ARE coming fast!&#34; Inhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hear that mija, you&#39;re going to hold them soon!&#34; Exhale. And then another contraction. Inhale. Pasha and the water again helps sooth me. Exhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sybil is still down there. Inhale. I hear her resurface... &#34;Master Daniella, she&#39;s at ten centimeters!&#34; Exhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Alpha in the next contraction you feel push!&#34; And she instructs me to simply stand and crouch at to allow the little gravity in the water help. I nod, that sounds right. And the next contraction comes and as I feel the pain I push as hard as I can, yet I feel Pasha massage my back still soothing me and Isla&#39;s hands holding me. Nina takes some water with her free hand and puts it to my forehead to help cool me and fix some loose strands of my hair... &#34;Are you serious right now! I&#39;m here pushing and you want to fix my hair for the camera?!&#34; Inhale. And I feel it and I push.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s crowning, the first one is coming.&#34; Exhale. I don&#39;t care who says what anymore I am more focused on this. Inhale, and I feel the next contraction and I push as hard as I can. Exhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s out! It&#39;s a boy!&#34; And Estefanía pases it to Daniella. And already I feel the next contraction. Inhale. And I push as hard as I can again. Exhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The other one comes!&#34; And I recognize Sybil&#39;s voice, and I rapidly feel the next contraction. Inhale. And I push again as hard as I can. Exhale. I feel another contraction. Inhale. Push! Exhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s out!&#34; And Sybil pases her to me! And I look at her and she looks at me with those beautiful jade eyes! This came out of me?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniella places the first one in my other arm and again those jade eyes! Both have his eyes! While they are both crowned with jet black hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isla puts out her arms to take the girl, and I give a little whimper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright mija, she&#39;s not going anywhere we just want to help you so you can push out the placenta. Then you can go to your room and we will help you wash, we will wash them and you can nurse them immediately, all right?&#34; And I hesitantly passed the girl to her and Tía is in the water right now and takes the boy. Just that makes me feel my heartbreak even though I know I will see them soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! Let Pasha, hold them!&#34; And they obey my command while I already feel a little contraction for the first after birth and I push it out. And almost immediately after that feel a small contraction for the other and I push it out as well. And it is done. I am someone&#39;s mother.</p>
