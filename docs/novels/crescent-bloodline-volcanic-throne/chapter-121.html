                <p>Shomari&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can&#39;t believe how exquisite she is and I never imagined this feeling of the Bond would be this strong, it took everything I had not to just go to her and take her. The second we were basically dismissed that&#39;s exactly what I did! I took to the platform and took her in my arms as she gave me a surprised yelp. I didn&#39;t want to be there, I wanted her to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright beautiful, just give me 54 seconds...&#34; She gave me a confused look yet her smile made me reach my rooms in 52.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I place her on the floor to examine this exceptional creature before me... Fuck! I was trying to control myself but my body isn&#39;t obeying I have never been this hard and I could smell her own arousal driving mine to DESPERATE levels! But oh my Goddess she was a vision!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is Shomari mate, and I know not, nor care what the Goddess was thinking when you were made but she truly became an artist that day.&#34; I had caressed her hair away from her ear to give my lips access to whisper in it and gave her a gentle kiss on it. I suddenly felt that her knees were getting weak and I wrapped my hands around her waist to steady her. I could smell the powerful Beta in her, yet I could smell she did have Alpha blood as well... Interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shomari... By the Goddess! It&#39;s stronger than I thought...!&#34; I understand what she means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright beautiful, I am not going anywhere and believe me... Neither are you!&#34; Yet it had the opposite effect making her knees fully buckle but I had her firmly in my arms... To be honest my own knees were not that steady. She was looking in my eyes and gently raked my face with her fingers while her own eyes were pitch black. At first glance she looks like she has the same mutation as The Spogels yet her almond eyes are so black I can barely tell any pupil dilation, I can&#39;t place my finger on it, however all I knew is that the Goddess must have been in a very good mood when she made her and she was MINE! Her blush invited me and I could already see how hard her nipples were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shomari... I am your Hayami... I am yours! By the Goddess! Claim me I am in agony just in your arms... I n-need more.&#34; Hayami, MY Hayami... I just couldn&#39;t anymore, I crashed on her lips and commanded access inside. And she opened herself like a blooming blossom. Awe man! Now I know the Goddess loves me! Both our hearts are pumping hard and a mile a minute. She was taking off my tie desperately, I was still trying to contain Omen. Slowly I had already discarded her blouse and the simple skirt she had, so I kissed her forehead and lied her on my bed, I noticed how young she was. I unbutton my shirt never taking my eyes from hers. Ugh! This FUCKING thing is refusing to cooperate! It&#39;s a nice tailored Master Oscar is going to kill me! Oh well...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck it!&#34; And I just shred it off, I just shred EVERYTHING off and I hear the chimes of giggles coming from her... Music! I was fully naked and took her from the bed, extended my claw and snapped her bra exposing two perky breasts, they were adorable! Small, yet big enough to have bounce. I caressed them tenderly and I feasted on her lips again until she gasped for breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mate is cruel... ONEGAISHIMASU my love! I feel I&#39;m going crazy!&#34; I chuckle and take one of her nipples in my mouth. Her hands on my face softly... She&#39;s so soft! I have one hand on her back pulling her chest to me and my other was now snaking it&#39;s way down to her honey pot. She&#39;s drenched! I have to taste her! I rip off her last garment and step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shomari! What are you doing?!&#34; And my smile just grows at the cute little pout dancing on her lips and frustrated eyes. However I rise one finger asking her for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One second my impatient beauty, I AM going to claim you shortly I just need to take you in... By the Goddess you&#39;re the meaning of perfection! Through the Bond I am already getting a bombing of her emotions. She became so silent to my plea and I noticed that she is now soaking up my own body with her eyes and suddenly she looks away much to my annoyance. Yeah I&#39;m an albino but since moving here my confidence is sky high, we aren&#39;t fully mated so she&#39;s still hard to read, I go to her with gentle words. And take her perfect face in both my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you look away Haya? You don&#39;t like me?&#34; She looks at me with a shocked gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bango! I love what I see, it&#39;s just... I have never seen a man like THIS...&#34; She covers her face with both her hands. I let go of her face and take her hands away and I press my body against her. I&#39;m around 6&#39;3&#34; and she must be about a head shorter, pretty tall for a female from her region.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t be ashamed with me love... How old are you? I&#39;m 23. There will be no secrets between us, you are my mate and I am also YOURS, do you understand baby? I BELONG to you to do as you wish, I am yours to command, I would live the rest of my life content even being your slave!&#34; My hand was caressing her face yet my other one was at her soft pussy and already had one finger inside her while I spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you understand beautiful?&#34; She nods while her eyes are dreamily looking into mine. She said yes so softly that if I wasn&#39;t wolf I wouldn&#39;t have heard her, so I played with that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that? I didn&#39;t catch that.&#34; Just when she was going to respond I kiss her lips again not giving her the chance and I put another finger inside her... By the Goddess, she&#39;s dripping in my hand. I don&#39;t know how much longer I can take enjoying her like this! I take my lips away and go to the place I want my Mark and give it a soft kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry baby, I still didn&#39;t catch what you said... What was that?&#34; And now I do look as deep as I can into her eyes and put my hand at her back again pulling her chest to my own making her gasp, her nipples are so hard it almost took me over the edge when I felt them on my own chest yet I intensified my glare on her. It WAS cruel what I was doing, I haven&#39;t been with many women and this is the first time a woman reacts so strongly to me. I was in agony myself, my dick and Omen were BEGGING me to cut the shit and take her, but I have never felt this desired and the more I am drowning in her eyes I realize that&#39;s she&#39;s feeling the same! How? She let out a whimper filling my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HAI! DAMN YOU TO HADES SHOMARI! YOU ARE FUCKING MINE!&#34; Her eyes... Pools of black ink turn electric green and her pupils are like those of... SNAKES! This is definitely a surprise! Is she a hybrid? Either way I can&#39;t take it anymore, I embrace her tight and kiss her forehead again as I place her on the bed and part her legs and drink her dry!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OH FUCK! SHOMARI! Please don&#39;t tease me anymore!&#34; I suck her clit and her moans turn into screaming as her orgasm gushed out of her and splashed my face. Her scent of pomegranates and cherry blossoms invading every one of my senses, and I cannot hold on anymore. I started to enter her gently taking into consideration what she said earlier and then I felt it, I retracted, she was still recovering so I used that to place her and me in a position that would avoid as much discomfort to her as possible, I have to take my own size into consideration. I entered her again I showered her with kisses and I pushed through, she hissed a little but wrapped her arms around my back and I pushed into her again and again. I stopped the bullshit, I was just lost in her green snake eyes and I let Omen have a peak and I heard a little gasp from her. My eyes must be bright red right now. One of her hands now caressed my face, her thumb closed my eyes as she passed it over my lids but she took it away making my eyes open again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s better! Now I ask you to never hide your magical eyes from me... You are so beautiful... You swear to never leave me right Shomari?&#34; I was so moved, my heart felt like it would just blow up. What the fuck did I do to be rewarded this way?! A small tear escaped the corner of her eye... I immediately kissed it filling my mouth with her salt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My love I could never be able to.&#34; I pushed harder. &#34;It would take Hades himself and still I would find my way to you!&#34; Faster, her eyes close for a moment and her gaze intensifies. &#34;I pledge my life to you, and only you can take it, if you wanted to pierce my heart with a silver dagger I would gladly allow you to do so, I&#39;m at your mercy my love!&#34; I just can&#39;t anymore and with a roar I spill myself inside her, I extend my canines and grab her neck, and I claim what is mine. And to my surprise she is still in her own orgasm with her very LONG fangs out and her green eyes glowing... The second I finish cleaning my Mark on her, she took a handful of my hair and her other hand a claw holding my shoulder... Fuck! She&#39;s way stronger than she looks and without warning she Marked my own neck... Everything went white. I was disoriented our feelings were filling each other up and I felt she was disoriented as well. I held tightly to her so that she could feel I was with her, that I had not left her. She did the same. We held each other like that for a while...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got our bearings I lifted her face to me with her chin. I didn&#39;t have any words, I just opened my feelings to her completely and she opened hers to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was Beta because she was their strongest Beta yet the only reason her pack &#39;tolerated&#39; it was because the Alpha was her half brother. The previous Alpha, her father, windowed young and was given a second chance with a shifter. The pack didn&#39;t like it and she was really an outcast, considered cursed because of her appearance. She had just turned 18 not three months ago and even though she always put a strong face she was always breaking. Her father and mother were killed in the attacks, but since her brother and herself were the strongest, the pack accepted his rule without much of a problem whatsoever. Her however was another matter, but since her brother didn&#39;t take shit from them and asserted himself and his power over the pack, he named her his beta telling anyone in the pack that if they wished to challenge her they were free to do so. One did, and she shred him to pieces! No one else challenged her after that... It still did not take away the dislike of the pack and the words calling her an abomination. As I was reading all of this lying with her by my side as I played with her hair she was reading me. I refuse to have secrets from her... The Goddess gave me a masterpiece and they DARED call her an abomination?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt my anger and looked at me, I closed my eyes... I was already feeling them misty. So she kissed my eyelids, I wrapped my arms around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bango watashi no ai! We agreed not to hide from each other remember?&#34; Even the pitch of her voice was perfect! I took a breath and opened my eyes... At that moment we understood each other fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will not leave me either Haya?&#34; She tangled her body more with mine and nestled in my chest listening to my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you feel it?&#34; She asked meaning my heart. I tucked her long, lustrous, pure white hair out of the way gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; She looked at me and smiled such a pure smile that made me frown in disbelief that such a small change of her face could have the power to dominate me with ease, I REALLY couldn&#39;t be away from her ever! She knows what I&#39;m thinking, except for official pack business, every fiber of me will be open to her always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My heart is with yours... How can I ever leave my heart behind? You&#39;re MY Shomari and I will always protect you.&#34; I gave out a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to make me fall for you Hayamisan?&#34; We both chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did it work?&#34; She asks her smile still lingering. But my face became serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, it worked the second I saw you... I love you Hayamisama... Anyone who disrespects, you, disrespects me. Trust me, you will NEVER be disrespected ever again.</p>
