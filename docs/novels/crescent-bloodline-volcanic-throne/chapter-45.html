                <p>Aymaco&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up about ten minutes ago and am just looking at the ceiling like a moron. Even with a 12 hour dose of Hayan drops and a mental water cleanse I dreampt of my mate. But no true dreams, only nightmares, visions of being caged, being beaten... being raped...over and over. I am full of fear and rage at the same time, I found her too late, and I am determined to make sure to be patient and make up for her pain. I just don&#39;t know where to start. I finally get up and after a hot shower link Iza to know about my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Maco, you were to rest longer.&#39; Yeah whatever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Izz, is she still there?&#39; &#39;SHE&#39;, that&#39;s all I have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Well since you are awake, yes. Get over here, I have information for you!&#39; She sounds exited... I don&#39;t feel &#39;HER&#39; conscious. &#39;On my way!&#39; I put on my shirt and a hoodie, no matter our elevated body temperature, it&#39;s colder here than I like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I walk into the tent my gaze falls on her... and I finally am able to SEE her. Her hair, her face, her loveliness. Loiza comes to me and embraces me, while saying to my ear... &#34;Amelia, brother. Her name is Amelia and from what we were told, a gifted doctor from Blue Moon.&#34; A name! I sit next to her. &#34;Amelia...&#34; And it feels right! &#34;Is there news of how she came to be in this condition?!&#34; And my self control slips asking that question with a low growl. I feel Bayo&#39;s hand on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy brother, this rabbit hole goes deeper than just Amelia.&#34; He basically links every play by play while I slept. I want to be near Amelia, I want to be there when she opens her eyes...but the pack comes first. I want to be there to verify my lab. I want to go to Blue Moon and eat this fucking Alpha&#39;s heart after pulling it from his chest. Loiza brings Kiki to report on Amelia when we hear the buzzing sound of a portal and cheers as well as curses swell the grounds. We all walk out and Urayoán comes with a huge grin and takes Loiza and lifts her in his arms!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We got the fuckers in the act! They were there! But we got them Izzy! Every single one!&#34; Iza starts smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Casualties?&#34; She asks now making him put her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NONE sister! Their numbers were low, they didn&#39;t expect us to move this quickly!&#34; And he takes another girl in his arms giving her a passionate kiss. I look at Bayoán...he clearly left something out of his play by play. The asshole just shrugs with an apologetic smile. Ura found his mate too, and by the smell, Twin Souls. And it takes everything from me to focus on not thinking about my own mate&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maco this is our new sister Freya...&#34; Izzy says akwardly. But I am happy for my brother, his good fortune doesn&#39;t make me less confident that Amelia will recover. And I go to Freya and hug what seems like a strong warrior, and being Ura&#39;s Twin Soul will make it easy to be familiar with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome to our family Freya! If ever you need to talk with someone with brains you now know who to come to.&#34; She laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry Maco, I knew the moment Ura and I mated! Smartest in the family!&#34; I give a laugh and wink at my brother while he just gives me the stink eye...Nice to know Ura KNOWS who has the top brains in the family. She is perfect for Ura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;General how many Council warriors were vanquished?!&#34; Loiza asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;50 land warriors, 5 witches and and an entire ship with the help of the Goddess My Alpha!&#34; She doesn&#39;t look happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many of OURS are dead or missing?&#34; Her face stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From the last report 1,357 dead, 239 missing.&#34; And we are all feeling the anger through her aura and the pack link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many fit in their ship?&#34; She wants the EXACT number of dead on The Council&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About 200 hundred Cacique.&#34; Cleo comes from behind answering Loiza&#39;s question, and she goes to her uncle who kisses her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that does seem right. Cleo, please make a tally of how many died on the side of The Council.&#34; Cleo bows and leaves to make good on her orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You intend to match their numbers to ours sister?&#34; I can still feel her rage... she is loosing control. &#39;Bayoán, she IS going to have time with Kayden tonight right?&#39; He looks at Izzy with a deep frown. &#39;I think we might have to move their meeting for before the ceremony, he might smooth her mood.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am undecided brother... either our revenge will be times three but I gravitate more to the idea of painting the halls of The Council a wonderful shade of crimson with the blood of EVERY member.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoa..she means war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Aryn&#39;s Alpha anger is catching up to Iza, while her Priestess diplomacy is fading. So yeah, up her meeting with Kayden, The Council must pay, but we need a strategy.&#39; I link Bayo. &#39;Agreed, I will arrange it.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the condition of the island?&#34; At this point she isn&#39;t asking anyone in particular.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Itiba City needs a lot of work, but all in all, Karaya will be home again! There is a brand new dock for the boats in Uguaca Bay close to Ticah Beach. The Priestesses are fixing everything and we have retrieved over 300 bodies so far, or what&#39;s left of them...we will give them a proper send off when we return.&#34; Braka reports. She nods still in deep thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call for Master Gadiel and tell him to gather every tech engineer to verify every laboratory, patent office, OPIA HQ and every office at The University. I want to know if they took ANYTHING and how fast we can get everything back to how it was. He will report to Director Gloria, the sooner OPIA HQ is working, the sooner we can contact those who are in the dark and inform the rest of our people the new rendezvous, plus we will need to get the stealthiest spies inside The Council. I want to know their layout and numbers ASAP&#34; She orders Bayoán. And he nods with a serious face. &#34;Maco, stay with your mate if you wish, but I would REALLY like to know if your research is intact. We might have need for at the very least a prototype of those thermal suits sooner rather then latter.&#34; Amelia is still healing and from what Kiki reports it might take another day or two for her to wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m on it!&#34; She gives me a grateful smile and takes a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am going with Yaya to check on everything for tonight. I want a report on the progress in Karaya and want to be informed the minute the team sent to Blue Moon comes back, understood?&#34; Yes Cacique! Braka gives a heart fist salut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will take my leave then...&#34; She turns and leaves, she looks calm yet we can still feel her rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has she been this intense since I have slept?&#34; This is not good, Iza&#39;s strength has always been fed by her self control and calculating nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She grows bolder and fiercer by the hour.&#34; Bayoán says still deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what?! They have basically declared war on us and tried to eradicate us!&#34; Ura says...always hot blooded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ura, no, It&#39;s not good! Izzy needs to keep a level head. This is war, not some small battle at the Uguaca Hills and Ticah Beach. She is working hard on keeping that level head, she is right to verify our tech and have OPIA running smoothly again, now that we are at war we need every shread of intel we can gather. We don&#39;t know what their numbers are, we don&#39;t know what technology they use if any, we need to know who are their allies and enemies, we need to know if OUR tech works and how long it will take the engineers to get it up and running. She made the correct commands but Aryn&#39;s rage is taking over like any mindless Alpha and that&#39;s not our way. She is not a mere Alpha, she is a Cacique, a Queen who has to control even herself. I will go now to relay her orders and have Alpha Kayden ready to meet with her before the ceremony, she needs to have full control over herself there, Yaya will lead it as High Priestess but Izzy has to assist as the only other Priestess of Karaya.&#34; Bayoán pinches the bridge of his nose. And I see him mindlink someone... &#34;I will meet Master Gadiel in the current tent being used as OPIA HQ, General, Maco, please join me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I also want to know if there is any word from the team in France. We need that mission to succeed and they need us as well, if successful our numbers will grow exponentially allowing for more warriors. The good thing is that their ways are very similar to ours and Natalia is leading the negotiations. Tía Ayiti hasn&#39;t been found yet, Talia likes her mother&#39;s advice with crucial missions like this... Gloria is a good Director for OPIA, but Tia Ayiti was Director for a long time and had a successful tenure, even father listened to every shread of advice from his older sister. More than ever I hope she is alive, she could serve in a Council I am putting together for Izzy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Lune Première Phase Pack have been having trubles with neighboring packs for centuries now, they may not be Islanders, but they do live in the south of France by the coast, so the ocean is also very well ingrained into their own particular culture. Their numbers reach over 5,000 and they are also very devoted to the Goddess, their High Priestess studied with Yaya under the vampire Prime Priestess Ziggy. After centuries of fighting against posible invaders they always come on top for having such alert and expertly trained Warriors. Yet for the past few years the attacks on their pack have been Non-Stop. Alpha Gúarionex owed a Blood Oath to Lune Première and vowed to take them into Karaya and having them join The Osupa if ever they needed and wanted. Alpha Antoine called a few weeks ago to collect that Oath and father sent the best negotiators of The Osupa, his own nieces and nephew: Talia, Lola and Umbros trained by their own mother. Talia and Umbros are Epsilons, usually the most outgoing, talkative and readers of the pack, they are also masters in stealth and some of the best spies in the pack. Lola joined as muscle in case the encountered trouble, she is a powerful and skilled Gamma Warrior, not that Epsilons are bad warriors, but earth is also their element and are most skilled at building bridges rather than burning them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be there in a few minutes, I&#39;ll meet you there.&#34; And I go to the medic tent to check up on Amelia before I leave... still she remains Sleeping Beauty. Hoping she can hear me... &#34;Amelia, I am Aymaco, but everyone mostly calls me Maco... I am your mate. I know that your trust level might be zero, but know that I will never reject you and I swear upon my life I will cherish and protect you from even Hades if need be. I will take you from this cursed place and you will live in a paradise... I hope you wake soon and allow me to earn your trust. I must go now beloved, the paradise I am promising needs to be reclaimed and repaired and I want it to be perfect for you.&#34; I kiss her forehead gently and go to find Bayoán... and now more than ever I am determined to make sure Karaya is as I promised... and I never break my promises.</p>
