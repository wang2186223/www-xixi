                <p>Ayiti&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Goddess! Gloria still can&#39;t prepare a proper report to save her life! Why doesn&#39;t she let Ameyro write them? I trained him myself and knows how to redact one! It&#39;s missing so much information... Meh, I&#39;ll just head over to HQ!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>OPIA HQ&#39;s building is downtown Itiba City it&#39;s always been a beautiful cylindrical building with extreme security. I&#39;ve always retained my Top Priority Security clearance, I ran the damn thing for over 30 years! I log in security and everyone says hello. I used to love this job, but it was correct to allow new blood to run it, I personally wanted Ameyro to be Director but Gloria had higher marks on the test and has always had a very good calculating mind for this job. She was my top field agent for many years and since she never found her mate, she basically lived there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need to talk with Natalia and the others to let them know that I am alive and to know about their mission and this other gibberish in the report to allow Víctor to do diplomatic work for another interested pack in Uruguay and another in Brazil. He is a gifted spy, excellent at interrogating and a skilled assassin but diplomat? He can barely get along with people HERE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director Gloria!&#34; I just barge in to MY old office, ugh! Who did she get to decorate this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Councilwolf Ayiti! How can I assist you today?&#34; He he! She sounds aggravated. Ameyro and Claudia look like they are giving her today&#39;s reports. I sit at one of the chairs at the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Director I did tell you I would come! I would like to be connected with Natalia through a secure channel please.&#34; She glares at me and Claudia offers me something to drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Claudia, some black coffee would be nice, none of that watered down crap, either something locally grown or if there&#39;s none I would take a good Colombian or Sumatran blend, thank you dear!&#34; And she started to hustle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Ayiti in the report I sent---&#34; Stop right there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look Gloria, you are very good at being Director and you were my top field agent with an impecable record. That&#39;s why you sit in the big girl chair now, but in the future please allow Ameyro to write the reports that will be sent to my office, I will definitely appreciate it!&#34; She&#39;s not looking happy, but what are you going to do?! And Claudia brings me the cup of coffee, ah nice! From the Batey District!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Gloria about that secure line?&#34; She sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, come with me!&#34; I can hear her teeth grinding... And I wink at Ameyro and he gives me a knowing smile shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We go to the long range comms department and she orders one of the communication agents to patch me through. I finish my coffee while they connect, if it&#39;s very isolated it can take up to an hour, but I learned to be patient of such things. Yet the connection went though quite quickly and Lola answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mami?! Oh my Goddess, we thought you were dead!&#34; They still hadn&#39;t informed them that I was alive and well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes mija, I&#39;ll tell you about it later, how are the negotiations going over there?&#34; We usually try not to disclose location even though secure channels. Try being key word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll put Talia on you know how I hate this shit!&#34; That&#39;s my girl!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MAMI?! Holy shit it&#39;s really you, we thought you were with Tío Ayato and were dead too! The French and Sardinians were going through exactly what&#39;s going on here, it looks like The Council is targeting potential low security packs for resources! The attacks are very well coordinated especially since they are using rogues. The pack here are rogues themselves but wanted to unite since lots found mates among each other and the large extended families didn&#39;t want to be separated. They don&#39;t have any official Alpha and just want to live without daily fucking attacks. They want out and agree to all terms, there&#39;s another pack in The Gambia who&#39;s uncle is Alpha to the mate of the leader here and their having the same problem. It&#39;s a good thing you contacted us just today since we are all packing and heading that way at first light to The Weer Pack, it&#39;s not large, about another 800, but since they live behind large walls it has helped them survive. They&#39;re tired of survival and Modou, he&#39;s the leader here convinced Alpha Dawda to meet. We will be taking a longer route but it has proven secure. If we move at top speed all day we could be safe within the walls by tomorrow night, but since we move with pups and elders we might reach there by the next morning. Umbros has already checked them all and they are clear, if everything checks out with The Weer and Alpha Dawda agrees to terms we will need pick up ASAP. Unlike the French and Sardinians they would only be about 1,400 give or take total. Tell Izzy to send the planes, fuck the boats! These people are beat Mami, they really need out like yesterday! How&#39;s everything back home, I hear it&#39;s better than back to normal, and woah talks about Izzy are going around, but I could use a break and go back home, Lola is driving me nuts with her complaining!&#34; And THAT&#39;S why I wanted to hear it from her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything here is well mija, focus on your mission, I will talk directly with Iza about the pickup. Do you remember the back channel code I gave you?&#34; Make it short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; She answers. Atta girl! I trained that girl myself to report everything in one breath if possible, unfortunately it stuck and sometimes she will just go on if uninterrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, contact Gloria when you reach The Weer Pack and are safe. Get transport for the pups and elderly, but have the Warriors flank the vehicles try to get there by TONIGHT at all costs. What have I told you about finding transport?&#34; She shouldn&#39;t be moving out on foot with pups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aquire by any means.&#34; Damn right!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So get it done, send me coordinates through the channel I told you, it&#39;s old but never been decoded, I will report it to Izzy to send pick up directly there, make sure there is a runway for the planes and have everyone ready to move out regardless if The Weer take the deal or not. You know what to do if the pickup is at night right?&#34; C&#39;mon girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Light the runway, I need the exact schematics for the sizes for the planes.&#34; And suddenly I think we can even do better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talia, you guys know how to fly Douglas C-133 Cargo Masters or Airbus A400M Atlases, right?&#34; An idea pops in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Affirmative!&#34; Of course they do!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a military base I know of in Gambia. Send me the coordinates of the pack so I can map out a route to get you there safely and just take them! We still will be standing by just in case. What do you think?&#34; Gloria is just in shock. He he! It feels like old times!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sending coordinates now, standing by for confirmation.&#34; Gloria is checking the coordinates. And we have satellite visual! I knew that fucking satellite would be very useful! Thank you for the lift Americans!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok mija, we have eyes on you and your destination, I&#39;m sending you a GPS route that is best to get to the pack and coordinates for a nearby base were you will be able to get more secure transport, they won&#39;t expect over 1,000 warewolves taking over and we will disrupt their satellite to give you cover and in the end it will just be an urban legend as usual, copy?&#34; This will work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roger that! I have visual, we&#39;ll go with that plan, just make sure we have cover and we&#39;ll handle the rest, thanks Mami. We&#39;ll see you soon!&#34; Soon!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be right here mija, remember to use the back channel if you encounter any emergency. We have eyes on you and Goddess speed!&#34; Yes, they will need it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roger that! Code name The Mouth out, over!&#34; This shouldn&#39;t be a problem for them at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now what&#39;s this bullshit of using Víctor as a liaison Gloria?!&#34; I don&#39;t like this plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ayiti he&#39;s an---&#34; Ugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An excellent agent for espionage and one of our best assassins we&#39;ve got but he&#39;s no diplomat! Isn&#39;t there anyone else in the vicinity?&#34; She shakes her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We called most field agents after the blast, that&#39;s how we found Admiral Casimar&#39;s brothers and why the original rendezvous was in Belize, most agents in Central and South America reached it on time before heading back. But Víctor&#39;s mission was top priority, so he stayed, sure he sucks at diplomacy, but THEY reached out to him and he has our terms. He has been ordered to talk as little as possible and not disclose his main occupation.&#34; Shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gloria with him leading this mission, ALONE, it could go south pronto! That boy&#39;s head is thicker than my ass!&#34; We could end up with more enemies!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am aware of the risks Ayiti, but they are in the same boat as the packs Natalia is dealing with, rogues in these numbers with such coordinated attacks over the globe... When in YOUR tenure have you heard of such a thing?&#34; Never, especially not in different countries. I rub my temples and sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even the other night Blood Moon was heavily attacked by every border, we&#39;re lucky we weren&#39;t there!&#34; Wait what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Alpha&#39;s mate was attacked? That wasn&#39;t even in that shitty report! You don&#39;t think this is information that the Alpha would want?! How many casualties?&#34; The FUCK?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy Ayiti, it was two nights ago and I just got the report this morning! There were only two casualties. It seems Alpha Kayden is more capable than we gave him credit for... Claudia bring the report to Councilwolf Ayiti.&#34; Claudia gets it and hands it over. See! A well written report! And damn! She&#39;s right! The attack was coordinated yet they were very prepared!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought they used regular warriors as patrols, Braka&#39;s mate was one and she&#39;s a Delta. It says here they changed it up to Epsilons! And he united with another pack? And a witch! From the report I got from him he seemed like an idiot, the boy is changing his tactics to... OURS!&#34; He&#39;s tapping into their Bond, but it would take more than a Bond to rearrange a pack that size so fast! What did you do Izzy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Director I will be back in 24 hours, if you receive ANY report from Natalia you are to link me at once! Instruct Víctor to be on his best damn behavior and get this DONE! Tell him he will have desk duty for a YEAR if his attitude fucks this up! I will be keeping this WELL WRITTEN report and take it to the Alpha at once. We&#39;ll stay in touch... Toodles!&#34; Did she share our tactics? Either way she would want to know.</p>
