                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Izzy! Can you be disturbed now?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes remembering where I am and I got their scent. All four of us dozed off on the couch listening to the recount of the Troyan War. There&#39;s always been this sadness when he recounts it in his beautiful Ancient Greek. I know his pain of what happened, we were just getting to know each other during this time... He was their protector and the heir to the throne was his son, the brave Warrior Hector. He was a demigod and Achilles was the son of Neriad like me, but what Thetis did, gave Achilles an edge. My beautiful Sun made a wrong play and it cost him his son&#39;s life, in the end Achilles died anyway. Two brave warriors that actually respected each other. I always thought that for Achilles, killing Hector was the hardest thing he ever did, even with the dishonor he did to his body... After, I went with Artemis to hide away his wife, the beautiful Andromache and their son Astynax. Apollo was heartbroken, it didn&#39;t take long for the city to fall after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What do you want Nina?&#39; I ask looking at all three of them sleeping as he holds us, I LOVE this sight... I always have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Don&#39;t you remember? Tattoos, talking about the reunion... Blah, blah, blah.&#39; Great Mother give me patience! His eyes slowly open at the my annoyance through the Bond. And gives me a beautiful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Get Mónica over so that she can take these two, they&#39;ll be out for a while, and if you&#39;re fine tell Nina to come, I know you want this done and I want those tattoos on you ASAP.&#39; He links me playing with my hair with the hand he had at my waist. It&#39;s true, once he starts a story, the kids usually get riled up or fall into deep slumber according on how he manages the pitch of his voice, more often than not he&#39;ll just use his lyre to put them to sleep. I wonder where it is I&#39;ll have one made for and get him a guitar, he loved it last time, he&#39;s so good at strings. I link Mónica to get the pups and Nina to come over and immediately the doors open and Nina and Tony are at the balcony, before she could squeal at the sight Tony covered her mouth. She gave him a death glare but came over and slowly took Deacon as I got up and He held on to Jade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mónica came for them and she saw the new Marks behind their neck, I just nodded signaling that it was fine. And she took them to keep napping. He got up and stretched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn that&#39;s the best I&#39;ve slept!&#34; He said yawning, I was in that haze as well, it was just a nap, but it was wonderful!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep?! How CAN you sleep?! Damn Izzy have you seen the human news?!&#34; Nope!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me guess Nina? Their governments are at each other&#39;s necks and their religions are declaring the End of Days?&#34; I sit on his lap kissing him deeply his eyes gleaming by Helio&#39;s light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah! Something like that!&#34; Oh Nina, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time they act like this. This is their nature... I look over at her...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina hun, everytime you left this island it was to witness the BEST of them. That&#39;s why I love listening to YOUR perspective, it helps me not be fully indifferent to them. Remember sister, when WE would go out, it was to DEAL with the WORST of them. If it wasn&#39;t for you I really wouldn&#39;t have any sympathy for them at all. If it wasn&#39;t for the love you hold them I don&#39;t think I would have cared if ANY died. Your love for THEIR creativity kept me grounded on REALLY not becoming the butcher I imagine they are already calling me. YOU saved a lot of people today Nina, do you understand your potential NOW?!&#34; She lets go of Tony and pulls me from Him. I&#39;m allowing my mind to allow to adjust to Kayden, even though we both know he&#39;s more than that and vice versa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take in her scent in our hug... I wasn&#39;t awake then, they teach us to love Nature in Avalon, not humanity... It would be an oxymoron education. Humans destroy Nature. And OUR artists, to me, were the best! But Nina places a lot of importance on details. THIS room is absolutely to my liking! The woman doesn&#39;t even know my true self yet, she kept everything crisp and white making the background of the Sapphire ocean dominate the room! It keeps a Caribbean aesthetic yet it totally reminds me of Santorini which I used to guard for many years. I was the one who actually made the Santorini aesthetic be that way to begin with, and my bedroom right now looks like it! And the fact that she put a fire pit... I&#39;m pretty sure she was already planning on holding The Circle here, but HE is of fire and an Alpha, I have to work with him to help him control it when the time comes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, it was through Nina&#39;s eyes in this lifetime that I did acquire some love towards humans. But every time we would go out in the field, it was just devastated what they would do to themselves, it would devastate us how we saw other werewolves be to each other outside of Karaya. It has only ever been to Ura and Victor that I opened my mind so that they could see Avalon and how we worked in complete Harmony, that&#39;s what I was taught, balance and harmony. That was the way of the Goddess Selene. Artemis never really wanted the charge of the Moon, she wanted to devote herself to her beloved Amazons, Ares loved them as well so they would actually have a lot of fun together. To Artemis, Apollo has always been the apple of her eye, much like Ura and myself, but she got along very well with her other brother Ares, I actually got along well with him, he&#39;s an absolute horn dog but when he saw that his brother and I were very serious he definitely laid off. So he went back to allow Aphrodite to do with him whatever she wanted... the man loved war but he really loved beauty too, and Aphrodite is definitely everything she represents and more. The gods are always taking sides, the ones we have in our side we definitely trust and love dearly, but with every relationship there is a complication. Aphrodite can&#39;t stand me as well as Athena, I have no problem with Aphrodite, I never understood what her problem was but Athena is another matter! Our shit is VERY personal and it got really ugly when she screwed with my best friend! What Poseidon and she did to Medusa is something I will NEVER forgive!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Medusa used to worship Athena, she used to be her Priestess! She guarded her Temple but Poseidon&#39;s lust is equal only to his brother Zeus! After Poseidon raped her, Zeus saw what happened and took his turn as well. When Athena saw this she cursed Medusa! My beautiful friend! I could never look upon her anymore! Zeus had already promised me to Apollo, but Poseidon wanted me, I had 49 other sisters! Couldn&#39;t he have picked another?! Apollo always told me that it was my eyes, every single one of my sisters eyes are blue, mine are the only ones that are Amber. He told me he first saw me because he thought he had seen a fire but it was my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because I was promised to Apollo, Poseidon could not have me, so he went for those I love! He took her in Athena&#39;s Temple, she used to be so naive I told her never to mention his name! Because Zeus partook and Poseidon kept the secret of what he did he had a trump card over Zeus. I always wondered if he had it planned to the minute, bastard! Just a threat to tell Hera what he had done was enough for him to sell us out, I was given to Poseidon at once! If it wasn&#39;t for Persephone, Apollo wouldn&#39;t have found me. I&#39;ll never forget his eyes the first time he saw me next to his uncle as a new Goddess of the ocean, he looked devastated. All I could do is look forward into my duty and he do his. But he could never stay away and I would meet him by the ruins of Troy, I would always come back pregnant. I refused all of my eggs to receive any seed from Poseidon, he raped me as many times as he could but never did I allow my body to be fertilized by him... I hope he still thinks Triton is his son, we haven&#39;t seen him in so long. I hope I get to see him this lifetime, at least I&#39;m sure Helios lives and is doing well!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina is still talking about what we should do but I am just so focused right now, I can already feel through the Bond that Kayden is taking hold of the conversation so that I am putting the puzzle together, he loves it when I can focus and he can reap the rewards! I swear the ages don&#39;t change him! I love him to death and back! That&#39;s right Persephone! Oh man! We have to get in contact with Hades! He&#39;s like the only uncle he has we like! He has a fish tank in his realm waiting for Poseidon!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nephew this fish tank awaits my brother! I hope that someday YOU will oblige me filling it with his soul!&#34; He really hates them both! They totally left him stuck with the Underworld and still he had to give up his mate for half a year! Demeter has serious letting go issues! When Perseus took Medusa&#39;s head, Hades made sure she entered Elysium to live in Perpetual Bliss I can&#39;t wait to visit her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy are you even listening?!&#34; Kayden didn&#39;t miss a beat. Wait? I was hugging her why am I by the ledge?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina dear sister, remember, Izz is still recovering from this morning, if you feel it, imagine HER!&#34; Smooth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it&#39;s all right bro just make sure she&#39;s okay all right? Izz I love you all right we&#39;re behind you. You&#39;re no butcher! Do hear me Loiza Anani!&#34; I keep looking at the waves, oh dear sister, but I have been a butcher before. A mortal life, even a werewolf life is more peaceful than the realm of the gods. We are the true monsters in the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think we are monsters?&#34; He asks me. I see he dismissed them and raised the sound barrier, he likes to link but he&#39;s always been a talker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I say firmly. &#34;I&#39;m glad we&#39;re not them anymore, do you understand me Kayden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He holds me, &#34;I know, I just wish---&#34; I put my hand to his mouth. I don&#39;t want to hear it, there&#39;s no point in wishing, yesterday is gone, tomorrow may not come, all we have is now. My bond is completely open to him right now and he is registering every single piece of the puzzle with every piece a nod of acceptance. But we do have to remember everything now that he knows my name. As long as we have the timeline correct we know who not to call what name not to allow around us, and I just remembered... I called for Poseidon inside the water when I was talking to Pasha! I gulped and he looks at me and he registers everything. He is soothing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long ago was that?&#34; I&#39;m thinking, think brain! But he holds my hands just nodding that it&#39;s fine he just got a memory that it wasn&#39;t the first time and we were in another place far away. And I catch it. Ok, cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have to ask Pasha she would know! Oh no! That&#39;s why she exists! It&#39;s my fault!&#34; I put my hands to my mouth not even believing what I did! He looks into my eyes searching my memory... because I was in charge of balance in the ocean and I left, another Neriad had to be born to take on that job! I sit down devastated, was that seriously the price?! I thought Selene would handle it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright, we&#39;ll handle it, ok? We always do!&#34; And a raven perched herself on the balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia?&#34; He smiles at me, he made sure she lived as long as I kept coming back. Just like the orcas for me... For my beloved, his were the wolves and the ravens. He gave her to me to help me focus to always follow the raven&#39;s way he even admitted that it was because of my Raven hair that he couldn&#39;t stop looking at me. And to think that it was his rage towards one that turned them black!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry I never found you when you were as Hepatia, you still made an impression like you did just today Love!&#34; Cheeky bastard always found a way to make me smile. Yeah, we tried the whole &#39;human&#39; life... Gods it SUCKED!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, we got this, we&#39;ve done it before right? Let&#39;s focus on now. I can already imagine Moira giving Marcus crap! Is it me or every lifetime she gets worse? What was your brother even thinking on tapping that?&#34; He asked. I couldn&#39;t help but laugh grounding myself to remember who I have to be and just enjoy it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no idea! Remember when she used to be a baby? She used to be adorable! Go on and rescue your brother baby, I&#39;ll deal with mine! Damn! Is it me or did they just basically give us the winning lottery ticket here with our families! This is crazy town! We got stuck with the weirdest crap ever! Do you ever remember us getting something like this? We must have asked for something big for us to be paying THIS price!&#34; And we just couldn&#39;t help it and started laughing remembering of all the other lifetimes and the craziness that just happened in this one!&#34; It reminds me of the lifetime we had in Sardinia and then for a second I thought of Caesar and I connected a DOT from my mother&#39;s diary! And I look at Kayden so he can see it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice! Juicy gossip just in time for your reunion baby! Damn that is going to be an upper cut and definitely help cement Maco. Are you sure it&#39;s better him and not Natalia?&#34; I had thought about it, but Maco is better. I know Natalia is in fact VERY focused. That&#39;s why she&#39;s the best at what she does! She can sell you the worst bridge ever and you will love her for it! But I need her major focus on top on we are doing now, I definitely want to ask her about this Beta who was able to killed his Alpha... He looked at me quizzically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it that you&#39;re thinking?&#34; His voice calm but I registered the anger. I looked him directly in the face. Yes! I understand the burden we carry. His power with fire will only increase and now that he has Caliburn back it&#39;s going to be dangerous. WE are the real problem on this island so we have to make sure it is as balanced and harmonious as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m thinking, of an off switch. A guarantee to give them a chance in case something goes wrong...&#34; He knows I&#39;m right, we always have to keep control, if we lose it, not only can we give away our position, we can bring major chaos upon the planet. This was also part of the price. He hugged me tighter... This will work out, it&#39;ll be fine. Again it&#39;s not our first time, it&#39;s just usually difficult in the beginning. I just want to make sure that we remember who our true allies are.&#34; He says holding me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you my love, Sophia always helps me find my way again...&#34; He just kissed His Mark and lingered a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right, we&#39;ve got this let me go rescue my brother! Talk with Nina ok? I totally agree, Maco will help regain harmony! I&#39;ll see you tonight all right, let me just get the ball rolling here. Oh and Izzy, if your Betas order you to dress a certain way, do it... Now more than ever they are definitely going to try to cement your Reign. I think those &#39;Bs&#39; that are appearing on their wrists aren&#39;t just a mere Blessing, I think it&#39;s an actual command embedded into their brains to guide you. I know you&#39;re considering this new Beta from India but be aware he just killed his Alpha, he has the will but he must be traumatized... remember Love it goes against nature just like you helped the orcas retain their pods, that&#39;s how I helped the wolf, we made sure that no matter what happened they survived. We&#39;re basically ordering ourselves around now!&#34; I lay on his chest and just allowing him to hold me while caressing my back, think of the irony. Are we playing officially by OUR own rules right now?</p>
