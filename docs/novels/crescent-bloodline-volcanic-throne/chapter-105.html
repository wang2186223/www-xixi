                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look if you&#39;re going to keep pouting I am definitely taking a bath, thank you for everything but you can go back home with your gloom.&#34; I get out from his arms and walk to the bathroom, he didn&#39;t like that his son was named for his wolf, even when I explained why. I couldn&#39;t care less. I pick up my hair with a hair stick. The giant tub was already full waiting for me, I put my right arm in adjusting the temperature. I feel him kiss the back of my neck, he picks me up and places me in the water. He gets in with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will take more than that to rid yourself of me woman! Do you think it&#39;s funny to have your wolf howling non-stop inside your head?!&#34; I can&#39;t help but laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he really?&#34; I ask sitting next to him and give him many kisses on his cheek. And he looks at the many bottles smelling them finally taking one and sits me between his legs, his nose is very good! He chose eucalyptus and pours some on his hands and starts rubbing my neck and shoulders. Why did I get rid of him again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not funny Izz, he&#39;s just howling in my head! Hades woman, how many oils and these other things do you need?&#34; Is he seriously trashing on my stuff?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As many as I want! Most of those are gifts anyway.&#34; He stops massaging me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gifts from who?&#34; He asks casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn baby, you would so suck as a spy!&#34; I start laughing. He gives a little chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would that be RAVEN?&#34; I point at my neck so he would get to it again, he chuckles and starts massaging again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you stopped giving me that wonderful neck rub already showing doubt, apprehension and defensiveness. THEN you ask in a &#39;CASUAL&#39; (yes, I am making quotation marks) way by whom... How on earth do you extract information from your prisoners?&#34; He laid his head on my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get the information from them! Don&#39;t you worry your pretty oil collection about it.&#34; As if!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That oil collection, I&#39;ll have you know was prepared by skilled Masters, some by yours truly! And are needed for particular rituals I must perform. I never stopped being a Priestess you know. Most are from before... The Incident. I had a habit of placing them in a large wood crate under a floor board. For some reason Nía though they were magical potions. As if I would bring ANY potions home from my post!&#34; He hugs my waist and lays on my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t want to bring any of that up.&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop that and continue with what you were doing. Kayden, it&#39;s DONE OK? I&#39;ve kicked you enough about it. I was angry, I still am, but I don&#39;t have the ability to change time nor do I want to... It is what it is, you didn&#39;t play a part on it. Do you understand?&#34; He keeps holding on to to me, I would probably know what he&#39;s thinking if I didn&#39;t have the Block and I&#39;m cursing having it right now. &#34;Kayden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izz, I&#39;m going to just cut to the chase, I know that whatever part my family had in the pain of your people had nothing to do with me, but I have lived in regret for the past months for not telling you the moment I found out... I was afraid. I regret being complicit in keeping from you the truth of those responsible for your pain, I betrayed you... my mate. For my part and for my family&#39;s crime I am begging you to forgive me and to let me prove to you that I am worthy of you, let me stay with you.&#34; His arms have me locked to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden if you want my forgiveness, you have it, but I don&#39;t know how this is going to play out. I told you there are things that I can&#39;t share with anyone at all. I asked you to give me time and you seemed like you accepted that. We&#39;re building trust, please I&#39;m asking for you to trust me!&#34; I start squirming to get out, I&#39;ll just shower. But he&#39;s not letting me go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have done everything to have you again! Why must you be so difficult?!&#34; I asses the situation. This is not going to end well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden, let me go please.&#34; He is refusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden, you ask for forgiveness and then do THIS are you serious?!&#34; I feel his pulse rise, I feel anger in his aura. There&#39;s something off. I try to turn around and look at him but he is unyielding and I suddenly feel afraid. My Mark turns orange and I focus on HEAT. Either he lets me go or he&#39;s getting a nasty burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SHIT! ARE YOU DOING THIS?!&#34; He lets go and I get out of the water and freeze it before he can make another move. I look at his face, he&#39;s REALLY angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious right now Kayden?&#34; For some reason I feel afraid of him. We were fine! We were just FINE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SERIOUSLY, YOU ASK?! I HAVE BEEN AN IDIOT LONG ENOUGH! WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SUCH A COLD BITCH?! ANOTHER ALPHA WOULD HAVE JUST TAKEN WHAT&#39;S HIS AND MAKE NO MISTAKE LOIZA, YOU AND THOSE PUPS ARE MINE!&#34; I wince at his words. Even with the Block that hurt badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the post natal care Kayden, I got it from here. It&#39;s time for you to go home!&#34; His eyes turn black... The ice will hold him, it&#39;s my strongest element. I link for Bayo and Víctor. I already feel my eyes getting hot but my soul getting numb, doing exactly what the Block is supposed to do, I go get my robe, sit on one of the chairs in the bathroom and wait while I stare at him. I thaw out the water holding his right hand and freeze it again except for his finger. He sees what I&#39;m going to do. And he roars at me! I take the ring and he roared louder with tears and desperation on his face!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izz, I don&#39;t know what--&#34; He starts pounding his head on the ice. I reach out to get the ring and he roars at me again! He fucking roared at me! Why does it have to be this way? My soul is numb but I couldn&#39;t stop the tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Víctor and Bayo come in with Isla. She comes get me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the fuck is wrong with me?! What am I saying?! I don&#39;t mean what I said. DAMN IT! I FUCKING ROARED AT HER! She took the ring... Why is this happening?! She&#39;s in tears, no, please. Block or no, roaring at your mate could break them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Víctor and Bayoán are here and Isla takes her away, NO! She&#39;s my mate, I still have to help her! Where did it go wrong? It&#39;s all blurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy, can you unfreeze the water please.&#34; Her brother asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand! I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening with me! Izz, I swear I didn&#39;t mean any of it! It&#39;s all FUCKING BLURRY! Am I going crazy?&#34; Bayoán looks strangely at me and tells Izz to wait and he links someone. I fucking hear my mate crying, what the hell?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fae/elf girl with purple hair comes in and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you inhabit him?&#34; She asks. And I answer her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t you like to know Phoebe?!&#34; I look at her hoping she knows it&#39;s not me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayoán, he doesn&#39;t carry the protection tattoo, they keep trying to get closer to her!&#34; WHO? I catch her scent by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exorcise him and send him on his way, the daeva still sticks with the hosts feelings, give him the specs for the tattoo.&#34; She says in a numb voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izz, PLEASE! I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening, I didn&#39;t mean any of that! I swear!&#34; She looks at me with the saddest eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes you did love. The daeva uses what&#39;s already there to promote chaos and disorder.&#34; The what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you blaming me for what some... THING made me say?&#34; A lonely tear rolls down her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... I wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s going to be removed from you now Beloved.&#34; She kisses my lips, I don&#39;t want her to stop. &#34;Kayden, maybe someday you&#39;ll understand why I am such a cold bitch. I really am trying to hold on to any hope, please don&#39;t make me let go of it.&#34; No, no!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izz, PLEASE! I don&#39;t think you&#39;re cold, and you KNOW I wouldn&#39;t hurt you... I couldn&#39;t.&#34; She nods a Phoebe and kisses me again. Isla takes her away. Phoebe&#39;s eyes and wings start to glow, I can&#39;t stop looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deamon hinc abite! Et non est tibi. Cui placet impares formas quas eieci te ut Cerberum altera prandium!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wake up in my room, it&#39;s almost 4:00 am... Then I feel I&#39;m not alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give you this Alpha, it took you way less time to awaken from your exorcism.&#34; Bayoán gets up and hands me a little bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For that pounding headache, you know what I&#39;m talking about.&#34; I drink it and the pounding stops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha, you are not to my liking because of anything you did or didn&#39;t do, because of your family or anything like that. I always have been kind of &#39;difficult&#39; myself and then YOU end up with the best of the best my family has to offer, family is very important to us, to our culture, to our standing in the tribe. I always expected Izzy to be mated to someone grand! Do you know that BOTH Prince Puck and Prince Angras, sons of Queen Titania and King Oberon of The Seelie Court desire her?&#34; I have no idea who they are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Was all I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Puck at least is heir to the throne of Faerie and Mustardseed. Both Titania and Oberon were furious with them! The sons of the Great King Oberon himself infatuated with a warewolf... Last Moira told me, she said that Angras still wants her for his consort. The Seelie don&#39;t care about Mate Bonds, they know how to cut them and fae don&#39;t tend to be with just ONE. They don&#39;t care about your pups, he would indulge her, but he would want her to give him children immediately and probably still find a way to rid himself of yours.&#34; Why is he torturing me this way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems like you don&#39;t like them any much more, why do I get this footnote Beta?&#34; I get up, at least I have my fucking pants on!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Bayoán to you dumbass!&#34; And he flinched his thumb throwing something at me. THE RING! I look at him confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I put it on and find an image of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it&#39;s Gaia&#39;s will, you ARE her mate and they ARE your pups and Goddesses help me but I rather you be her mate than Angras. I know you love my sister and you&#39;re dumbass self will try again to get her back, maybe this time it&#39;ll stick. I KNOW what it&#39;s like to have one of those... THINGS, inside you. And because of it I hurt my Alpha and sister, my mate and my pack and you know what that &#39;cold bitch&#39; did? She forgave me, my mate forgave me, my pack forgave me. I KNOW Izzy carries secrets she can&#39;t share with anyone, maybe now you&#39;ll understand why she is like she is.&#34; And he points at the ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s always hard... Keeping secrets you can&#39;t share with anyone, it makes you naturally untrusting. Afraid that a slip up could cost someone you love or respect their life. Alpha don&#39;t make me regret giving that back to you, I have just broken a command from my Alpha. I was to get you Forgetting Potion... I am overriding that command because I have assessed the situation and knowing that you&#39;re willing to give her your marrow has made me conclude that you may not be &#39;grand&#39; but you are perfect for her, I actually think that&#39;s how the daeva got in... When you were weakend by transferring marrow. This isn&#39;t The Council&#39;s work Alpha and it&#39;s not the first to be put in the body of someone close to her and we have no clue who or what it is, just that it&#39;s looking for her.&#34; I can&#39;t stop touching the ring, it&#39;s like if I don&#39;t touch it, I will loose it. SomeTHING is looking for my mate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You say &#39;something&#39; like it&#39;s not of our world. But it seems like it&#39;s found her if it&#39;s putting it&#39;s demons inside those close to her and how is it that there has only been just two? Your numbers are in the tens of thousands.&#34; Is it looking for the pups too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not of our world, that&#39;s why I told you the story of Titania&#39;s sons, it&#39;s one of the many possibilities, again Angras wants her badly, he has not taken a concubine since Izzy was 15, he wants to show her that he can be loyal to her, he sends her messages, but she has never accepted them, Izzy always wanted her mate. I don&#39;t know what is Gaia&#39;s plan but Moira always said that it was by Selene&#39;s will that Izzy become powerful but that Gaia guarded her steps and would return her to her true self. Regarding your other question it&#39;s because of this...&#34; He takes off his shirt and shows me his back, it&#39;s the same one as the one on Izz&#39;s ankle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone on the island got one, even the vampires, I got mine in XXXL size cuz you could say that having ONE inside me was more than enough for me.&#34; It&#39;s his whole back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where can I get one?&#34; I feel numb. I wish I could start yesterday over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s the design.&#34; He hands me a paper with the tattoo schematics. &#34;Tonight I am going to send a buddy of mine to make it for you. But I would try to convince everybody in your pack to get it, show it to the Kappas, they always find a way to make it perfect and this HAS to be perfect every single time, every symbol, every measurement or it&#39;s useless. Do you understand?&#34; I nod my head. &#34;I will make sure the original plan is put in place, your man Jason will contact you tomorrow, I will make sure he gets tattooed ASAP.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you keep mentioning Gaia? Why is Izz important to her?&#34; And he looks confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You carry her Mark... She MUST have manifested herself to you. It was her who mated you with Izzy, not Selene, she bequeathed her blade to you and don&#39;t you have her grimoire?&#34; The fuck?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had no clue...&#34; He puts his shirt on again. &#34;I&#39;ll send my friend at the same time we would have come for you. And remember Alpha, The Council... we can deal with fairly easily, this other thing... We don&#39;t even know WHAT it is and what it wants my sister for. So get it together and work your ass off to be the strongest version of yourself you can be, because she needs you and I&#39;m sick of watching someone I love, live constant heartbreak. We need OUR own Queen and Gaia crowned her to be it. In just two nights you helped revive her, I will always be grateful to you for that. Imagine what could be if you could make it permanent. And sorry about the shirt, that &#39;cold bitch&#39; wanted your children to remember your scent. Frank Oller will be here don&#39;t dare make him wait.&#34; He puts on an earpiece... &#34;Code name Changó ready for a pickup, lock in coordinates.&#34; I go to my closet and get another shirt and pass it over all of my scent glands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayoán! Thanks man. So they can each have one.&#34; I give him the shirt. He smirks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem Alpha, you have a LOT of studying to do. Ask the ring ANYTHING, not just dumb human world shit, it will explain it in great detail.&#34; The portal opens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Kayden to you douchebag.&#34; He smiles and nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Copy that Kayden, Changó out.&#34;</p>
