                <p>Aymaco&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So he&#39;s going to GIVE us Hacienda Florencia with the village? By the Goddess, who lives in that village now?&#34; Amelia and I are in this huge bathtub in a suite guest room we lifted the sound barrier here and definitely enjoying the hospitality of our Bisabuelo. After seeing Abuelo&#39;s pictures and knowing how his life went about I was feeling desperate to make love to my beautiful woman. She was a little startled for what happened to him since it hit a little close to home... Yet she was EXTREMELY passionate. She understood my own discomfort at the idea of sharing his fate. So we are just chatting about anything while I massage her feet, she always wears a beautiful smile of satisfaction every single time!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah! You saw how exited the old man was... It&#39;s like he wasn&#39;t really looking for a seller rather than other family that would take it off his hands! Even Phoebe confirmed that he mostly didn&#39;t want to disturb his ancestors bones... You know already what something like that would mean for us.&#34; I have even talked about this with Alex, he sometimes doesn&#39;t know if he should move his parents bones when he decides to make an ancestral burial chamber of his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;m for it then! Damn babe, if Nina can get it to where it looks like THIS place it would be amazing! I feel like I&#39;m at a weekend getaway! This room is insane! I can&#39;t even imagine the one Izzy and Kayden got... And when we took the pups to the nursery it was impressive. They definitely reproduce like rabbits! There must have been at least 9 little ones being cared for, I&#39;m definitely glad that Mónica and Danika came along. I feel secure here, but I think I would have been a little jittery if only their people took care of the pups. That nursery though! Even Nina was asking who decorated it, I mean Rafael is amazing but it&#39;s good when new names get recognition!&#34; My, my...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well someone is quite chatty today!&#34; She&#39;s been very excited since our Bisabuelo declared that we would have a Beta. I agree with Bayo that the dude is just old and just doesn&#39;t care how people see him but we had another impression of him originally. Abuelo was angry and he was able to vent his anger once Izz gave him the ability to, but he explained to us that his father is from another generation and that was kind of expected back in the day, he even said that there were times that our own mother had to bow her head to him. I remember Dad saying something similar about Abuelo...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little shits like to complain about what an asshole I can be, but Dad would have whooped all your butts all day like drums!&#34; Then he would proceed to be absolutely embarrassing by playing a pair of congas in the Main Room of the house, it would drive Nina crazy because the old man was always out of tune. He would coax her and she couldn&#39;t resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon mija! Show them how I KNOW you want to whoop ME!&#34; She would laugh and would shoo him out of the way so she could show him how it&#39;s done! He couldn&#39;t play, but he COULD dance! He would pull Mom to dance with him and she would definitely join him and we could see how much our parents loved each other as they would dance salsa and Nía would join Nina with the bell to hold the main rhythm. Then he would lift me off my ass to dance with Mom while he took Izzy to dance with her... I miss that old man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And someone went far away there for a moment... You&#39;re thinking about them? You are so lucky to have had them Mi Amor.&#34; I go to her side and take her in my arms. Her own family cast her off and her father was a monster, I put my hand on her belly, our daughter is awake and kicked the moment I placed my hand. Bisabuelo apparently has the gift of foresight of where an unborn pup will be in the Greek coding, and Phoebe confirmed that he has declared every birth of his children, grandchildren, great grandchildren to even great great great grandchildren. This helps us out a lot with choosing a name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess preciosa, I just am so happy to have you! I don&#39;t want to imagine how Abuelo&#39;s life has been. To not be able to have the simple pleasure of holding the other piece of your soul and feel the life your love created inside her... I love you Em.&#34; She puts her hands on top of mine. Bisabuelo was VERY satisfied when he saw Amelia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a shame that I can&#39;t figure out if the little Beta will inherit such STUNNING eyes!&#34; He sent his great granddaughter Gabriela to send offerings to the shrines of Lobo Azul for the pups and a special one for our daughter to inherit her mother&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still can&#39;t believe what a big deal my eyes are here?&#34; She still doesn&#39;t understand how stunning she is... Her deep auburn hair just makes her eyes even more vivid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean mija?&#34; He was genuinely confused. She blushed that beautiful soft rose color that makes me want to take her right there!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing Don Juan, people just didn&#39;t think that they were pretty and would just say I looked like a freak.&#34; He couldn&#39;t believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What now? Who would say such a thing of magical eyes like that? Even humans? There are many mutations that humans dislike but heterochromia usually is quite popular. Are you telling me that WOLVES are rejecting their natural mutations?! He slammed his hand on the table or the huge Dinning Hall of Lobo Azul, he WOULD be outraged. The Guerrero family have other valuable contributions to our pack, since the first Lycan of our tribe was among themselves and it helped them grow to be as powerful as they are, The are the founders of The Lycan Proyect which specializes in VERY RARE mutations. They are such a large family that they do have an Omega branch and he introduced all of us to an underground lab they have HERE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had heard about this facility but never seen it. Our cousins Salvatore and Florentino, an Alpha and an Omega, are the main researchers. They asked if they can have a sample of all of our blood including the pups. They already had a sample of Izz&#39;s twins because of the particular mutation of their skin. Em was very impressed by the lab, and they invited her to participate in their research and she jumped on the opportunity, we&#39;ll come over a few weeks after she gives birth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were excited for Bayo&#39;s son&#39;s blood, they still hadn&#39;t had the chance for a sample to study how the pup&#39;s cells were channelling his hybrid blood. At this both Morgana and Bayo were very interested, already Daniella is working on it in her lab but it eventually would have ended here anyway, or the other facility they have in Downtown Atabex City. They assured a very good plot of land and The Lycan Proyect&#39;s building there has a lab but it&#39;s also part mate searcher for mate less wolves, not just Lycans and it shows and explains the mutation and the history of the hunting of the species to almost extinction. Many of the wolves from Rumania have been working there since the mutation was been found more prevalent in their breed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I haven&#39;t been to the new facility but Nina&#39;s friend Roselia designed it and it better structures the proyect and since they don&#39;t have plans for the building they had it before in Downtown Itiba, Bisabuelo wants me to have it on the condition of being an investor and having some shares and having a Board member on his behalf once we were big enough for that! I definitely took that deal! Abuelo presented me to our cousin Santino who&#39;s almost 16 but is a really gifted Mu who loves our products and begged for an internship! I linked Gadiel...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Fuck yeah dude! That building is even bigger than the one we we&#39;re going for and I HAVE heard of that boy from my brother, he says he&#39;s a fucking genius who hacked into OPIA! I say we definitely take him in!&#39; I asked Em and she thought that it would be bothersome for him to get up so early. So to invite him to stay with us, now that we&#39;re going to get Hacienda Florencia we can definitely house as much family as possible!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I told Santino that he was welcomed and that he could stay at the house he ran to pack! His mother, is Abuelo&#39;s older sister María and Santino is her youngest child, she was very happy for him and nagged him on the conduct she expected from him... His face almost made me spit out my wine! It reminded me of mine when Mom would nag at me... I wish she could have seen this. By the Goddesses they are SO MANY! Either way Santino can&#39;t wait to bail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bisabuelo already handed Nina all the keys of Hacienda Florencia and has one of our cousins looking for everything related to the property so she can have a better idea of how it originally looked, she&#39;s excited. Without the expense of BUYING the property we will have enough left over to fully fix the house in Granada and get the vineyard in Nappa, the beach house in Karayita was a given! Marcus and Kayden are definitely BOSSES in business and already are planning for the company that they already have operating smoothly to export the wine from Nappa. Ishaan also has a keen mind for it, the company that sustained Chandrama is a pharmaceutical, we already have cures for DOZENS of human diseases. That company shouldn&#39;t be a problem to get profit in fast. There&#39;s already a team working on the one Tony and his pack brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, we had a really pleasant afternoon and evening getting to know as much family as we could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, so you&#39;re saying that ANY of our pups could be a Lycan?&#34; Urayoán asked Salvatore and Florentino at dinner. We all looked to see their reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, yes! In fact that is true for any of YOU too. If the gene is inside you it could lay dormant your whole life and you just pass it on, however we still haven&#39;t determined how or why the dormant gene awakens. We have noticed that it presents itself in Alphas but it is most active in the Delta strain of the Greek coding. What we are ALMOST certain is that those with the gene ACTIVE are BLUE wolves, THAT is something that we can AT LEAST determine in the first shift of a pup. Some don&#39;t know until one full Moon they can&#39;t control it and you just shift to that form, that lack of control is what presents a problem. The mutation onto itself is something NATURAL just like our regular shifting into wolves, it&#39;s just that we have mastered it so well through the ages that we have control over it. However the Lycan mutation has been seriously stigmatized by humans that it has traumatized even OURSELVES. Many of our kind outside didn&#39;t lift a finger to avoid that genocide, they thought that it couldn&#39;t be controlled but our research has found that nothing can be further from the truth! I am a Lycan myself, and I am in full control on the full Moon and that goes for every Lycan who lives on the island. Since we don&#39;t traumatize the pups at a young age with the stigma placed upon the mutation we allow them to make it easier to accept it if they have it and eventually activates. The biggest problem lies in those with the mutation to find a mate, because it&#39;s so rare the chances of finding ONE is hard, that&#39;s why it&#39;s so accepted for one to have multiple mates... I guess it comes down to what the Goddess knows. Either way the specific part for which the particular species was hunted to almost Extinction is something that we have been able to correct, incredible how it only took EDUCATION to cross that hurdle, I&#39;m not good at comedy so that was sarcasm.&#34; Salvatore answered with a shrug. They couldn&#39;t help but laugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you kidding me?! You explained all of that and then you hit the punchline but the way you delivered throwing yourself under the bus was pretty good! Dude we just have to work with your delivery but you got the funny bone in you!&#34; Nía always has to give her opinion. She knew some our cousins already and was hanging out with them and showing off Nasser like a piece of slab meat! Poor guy, he looked at any of us for rescue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry buddy! Though luck, here man, this is what I can do for you.&#34; Tony handed Nasser an edible and he just ate it in resignation to at least laugh at Nía totally being the boss of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However I wasn&#39;t laughing, I swear these idiots... Amelia does understand, it&#39;s not like she sees Mero ALL. THE. TIME... She coughs trying to get my siblings attention and it finally dawns on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mero is a Blue Wolf...</p>
