                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we enter the tent I see Gloria with Claudia and Ameyro, thank the Goddess they made it out alive! And I remember that Natalia, Lola and Umbros, my cousins are in France on an important mission, our Tía is missing, I hope she&#39;s in the boats... All three in the tent stand and bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cacique we are ready for your command.&#34; Gloria says. She is the best at what she does and for that she has my utmost respect, she can be hard to work with but I understand that her experience has been forged by years of study, observation and her Beta blood. She always keeps her dark blond hair in a short bob and her olive green eyes are as stern as ever, but as Alpha I sense how tired she is. I can only imagine the lengths of effort she has gone through to contact every spy... or at least tried. When I worked for OPIA she would always make sure to know the status of every spy and their exact location on the planet in case of an emergency extraction. That is something we are SURE The Council doesn&#39;t know... we have our own satellite in orbit. I only hope that it&#39;s command center wasn&#39;t fully destroyed, I am hoping it contains images of what happened that day. But first we need to get to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope there is no bad blood between us Director.&#34; She can be a bitch at times but Gloria is no traitor and has dedicated a great deal to improve our methods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None Cacique, water under the bridge. You are our Alpha and we follow you to take back our home and avenge our dead.&#34; Good to know. And I smile at her giving her a respectful bow as well and she smiles back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, where are we now?&#34; Bayoán proceeds to tell me all that has happened. And I make sure not to show my disappointment at Joel&#39;s non testimony. Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will go with General Braka, Ura and other trackers and a dozen Priestesses to Karaya to search for anything we can find. If The Council is involved in this we will find it.&#34; Moira assures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Braka steps forward: &#34;Cacique before we move on, about the girls who want training to be Handmaids...&#34; And I suddenly notice them in the tent with a beautiful, very tall warrior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are they doing here General?&#34; The hell! This is supposed to be Top Secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems you and Yaya made some promises Loiza... What were you thinking?&#34; Moira snaps at me, I knew it wouldn&#39;t last very long...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cacique I just wanted to get it out of the way before we proceed.&#34; And I notice him grazing hands with the warrior. He finally found his mate! And now that I notice more closely she is almost identical to Kendra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it seems everyone is finding their mates! Congratulations General! What is your name Warrior?&#34; Now it makes sense, he wants to basically do the same I did with Kayden but with HIS mate...I HAD told Kendra to get her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Helena, Alpha I just came because Kendra said you needed my permission and I am giving it.&#34; She says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Of course, you must forgive me Helena my mind is in many places at once. I am glad you are giving your permission---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And by who&#39;s authority are you making these promises Loiza?!&#34; Moira snaps at me AGAIN... and now that I know where we stand in the hierarchy I feel a little emboldened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By MY OWN Moira! Avalon didn&#39;t provide me with assistance and since Yaya trained her own daughter I decided to take the girls under my wing, WHAT is the problem?&#34; And I notice Bayoán smiling full of pride. &#39;Maybe you don&#39;t need me at all sister.&#39; He links. &#39;DON&#39;T start!&#39; And he just continues to smile while Moira has her stone cold face. I have never called her by her name before EVER and she can&#39;t say shit about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not qualified to train Handmaids.&#34; Ugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Lady we have much bigger matters to deal with and not much time, are we REALLY going to argue over two girls getting training to assist me? And before you answer I suggest you dig deep to give me a satisfactory answer as to your objection.&#34; I am not in the mood for petty bullshit. But she doesn&#39;t seem to have any until she gives me EXACTLY what I want!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no time for that now, they will be trained in Avalon with professionals.&#34; Check!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that is indeed a magnificent solution My Lady! I accept your proposal, I guess that&#39;s why it is you who rules over Avalon!&#34; And before she can change the rules...&#34;So, Jolene, Kendra, Helena, would you like to join our pack? That way Jo and Kendra will train under the protection of Avalon and not be in the middle of this frey!&#34; And for the first time in my life I see Moira surprised and it tastes so sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; All three say in unison. I wanted to laugh my ass off! But Bayoán actually did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good then that is settled, let&#39;s get this over with so we can actually get to business. Let&#39;s get you all sworn in the pack and you two packing to Avalon!&#34; And I lead them outside where Cresta and Ayana are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guys, I need somethings from the kitchens to swear three new members to our pack, can you help me?&#34; I tell them what I need and they head out. Ayana can escort the girls to Avalon since she has the ability to open portals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They come back quickly with the items I asked for. It&#39;s very simple, a bronze chalice, red wine and my blood. I pour the wine in the chalice and hand it to Cressy to hold while I extend out one of my claws and cut a vein of my wrist and allow the blood to pour in until the cut heals. I take the chalice and my Mark shines orange heating the wine and blood. I hand Helena the chalice... &#34;Ok ladies, all you have to do is take a deep drink and say: &#39;By the Blessings of the Goddess I swear my life to The Osupa of Karaya Island of our free will and by the blessing of it&#39;s Alpha.&#39; And voilá you are Osupa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All three swear the oath and their connection to Blood Moon ends and they are now in The Osupa network and they are linked to the pack. Some that were in the tent stand to witness including Moira. And while Braka lifts his mate and kisses her I tell the girls to go home and pack, they should be around one year in Avalon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you are done packing, my friend Ayana will port you to the dock at Avalon and The Lady Moira will assign you a teacher to instruct you, Helena will you be ok with Kendra gone for about a year?&#34; I say ignoring Moira&#39;s glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has wanted to go to Avalon since very little, when I would tell her the stories our mother told me of it and was devastated when she failed her trials.&#34; To this Moira IS curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mother was a Priestess?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes My Lady, sadly she died giving birth to Kendra, I imagine it was the strain from the jurn---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A Priestess dying of childbirth?! That is near imposible, no matter the strain of a jurney and she died HERE? What was your mother&#39;s name child?&#34; About time she understands that there is something going on here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mother was Su Mei, My Lady.&#34; And I see Moira&#39;s jaw tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mother was a High Priestess trained by myself! What&#39;s happening in this pack? Nevermind, we will investigate this as well. Take the girls to pack everything they have, they shan&#39;t be coming to this pack again. Ayana go with them and take the girls to Avalon and deliver them to Ryoko, she will mentor them, understood?&#34; I wink at Ayana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes My Lady.&#34; She replies with a curtsie. Goddess, I always hated doing that and it&#39;s basically the fucking first thing they teach you in Avalon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for this Ayana, when you return we will talk about your request, ok?&#34; I want her to know that I have her back and make sure that she has an excuse to return quickly, I would like her to be The Guardian of the Eastern Cardinal temple. And she smiles back in understanding. And with that Helena kisses Braka one more time before going with the girls and Ayana. Whatever happens now, both girls will be safe, Braka will be able to have alone time with his mate and Moira is now committed with my plan. Having her Priestesses under any threat, she WILL take it personally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wonderful! Now shall we begin this already?&#34; Now that I know Moira and Avalon will stand with us I am more determined than ever to get our fucking island back and our revenge...</p>
