                <p>Aymaco&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Braka and I descend the stairs of the dungeons I am invaded by the stench of blood and death, but there is even a stronger scent! Mero is alert! &#39;MATE! Maco our mate is there!&#39; The smell of lemons and jazmines! I walk quickly to every cell, and then I got to where the scent was coming... to my horror there is a dirty and bloody unconscious girl inside!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HEY YOU! OPEN THIS CELL RIGHT NOW!&#34; I yell at one of the guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pfft! No way man, she&#39;s Theo&#39;s property, I&#39;m not getting into any crap with one of the Gammas.&#34; Property?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t worry about getting into crap with Theo when you are going to get into DEEP SHIT WITH ME! NOW OPEN THIS CELL OR I WILL OPEN YOUR SKULL!&#34; Property, what the fuck is going on here? I can tell she is an Omega! How could they treat others like THIS?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look man you can shout all the bullshit threats you want, I follow the orders of MY superiors!&#34; Just as my claws are extending to END this motherfucker my sister is looking at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ENOUGH!&#34; Damn, Loiza&#39;s Alpha voice is stronger than Yadiel&#39;s, maybe even more so then Alpha Gúarionex. &#34;What the hell is going on here?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy! My mate! I found her! She&#39;s in this cell!&#34; She pushes the guard to look in the cell...&#34;What crime did this woman commit to be locked and in THIS condition?&#34; Loiza asked calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crime? No, Theo bought her from Marius. He just hasn&#39;t broken her in yet.&#34; What the actual fuck was this. Like if reading my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT?!&#34; Both my sister and Braka yell. I see Yaya poke at Braka and hear him explain what&#39;s going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you telling me that you buy and sell WOLVES, members of your packs like SLAVES?! Is THAT what your saying?&#34; Loiza&#39;s eyes are gold and I kneel down trying to reach my mate, to touch her! The bars are made of silver, I am literally burning myself to get to her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I command you to open this cell at once!&#34; Loiza is on kill mode and I am definitely not going to stop her I have been looking so long for my mate! I am 27, I have been longing this day since before I was 18!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Theo will kill me!&#34; The guard is really conflicted now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is your name soldier?&#34; Loiza asks plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Kevin.&#34; She gives him a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kevin, you can worry about Theo killing you latter or ME killing you NOW. When I count down to ONE that cell better be open... 5, 4, 3&#34; Izzy didn&#39;t have to get to 2. Kevin had quickly assessed the situation he was in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bother, take her to Daniella.&#34; I obey at once, I pick up my mate gently and walk out with her. I can&#39;t look at her, I feel heartbroken! My mate was bought and sold as if she was a piece of property. I walk over to the tent OUR pack was using as a medical facility. I was able to find Estefanía, Daniella&#39;s apprentice and a gifted healer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By The Goddess! What happened to her?!&#34; She instructs me to place her in a gurney and takes scissors to cut off her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was in the dungeons.&#34; I give her an account of what happened and that this is my mate. She listens to everything with out stopping or breaking eye contact with her task, until I mention that she was sold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT? SOLD!&#34; And she covers her mouth remembering her care for her patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is an Omega, Maco! Why would they sell their most valuable members?&#34; When I was still traveling gathering information, I saw how many packs treated their Omegas like trash. And always the answer to my question of &#34;Why?&#34; It was met with &#34;Because they are weak.&#34; And every time I would try to explain that Chis, Psis and Omegas were weaker was because they are not meant to be Warriors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their energy and main gift lies with healing. They make up most doctors, healers, psychotherapists, aura readers, Chakra alignments, chiropractors, physical therapists, every single thing a pack needs to be HEALTHY is carried mainly on the backs of Chis, Psis and Omegas. Daniella was an Omega and Estefanía was a Chi. Suddenly I hear sound outside the tent, I don&#39;t want to leave my mate but she is in good hands. &#34;I leave her to your care, I&#39;ll check what&#39;s going on.&#34; She smiles at me... &#34;I won&#39;t let anything happen Maco, and congratulations for what it&#39;s worth.&#34; She is cutting her shirt now and I see scars... Estefanía covers them up and looks at me, &#34;I thought you said you were leaving? Maco do your duty, let me do mine.&#34; I take a deep breath and go outside... WHAT THE HELL?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could not believe my eyes! Braka, Yaya and Izzy were all carrying someone in ghastly condition and putting them in front of the tent!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;General call some guards, we need help getting the rest!&#34; She sits on the ground and looks up at me. &#34;They basically have a fucking meat market down there! Most people are slaves and THIS one...&#34;She points at the girl with matted pale white hair and skin, Loiza wipes the girls forehead to show a pale blue diamond birth mark. &#34;...is a UNICORN! Do they have ANY IDEA the consequences of this?!&#34; I have never seen a unicorn, but Izzy and Yaya have! &#34;Maco I KNOW you are in pain and full of rage, but I need you, can you keep your shit together right now?&#34; She had just dismissed the pack so they could rest, and I know that even with Yaya&#39;s boost and the power of an Alpha Izzy must be spent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am in control Alpha, what do you need of me?&#34; If Iza is going on I am not leaving her on her own. She smiles at me and gives me a serious look... &#34;Wake the Alpha and Beta, if I wanted answers from Elder Joel 20 minutes ago, I NEED answers to THIS NOW! I have severed Joel&#39;s link to the pack and he isn&#39;t going anywhere&#34; She looks at Braka: &#34;General I want Elder Joel in a cell chained and guarded by our own men, wake Jorge and Susana, they are the best. I don&#39;t want the fucker taking his life before I get EVERY bit of information I intend to squeeze from him, so warn them to even put a tongue guard, I won&#39;t risk him bitting his own tongue off!&#34; And like that I can barely recognize my own little sister... if she is exhausted, she is not showing it, she is angry, she&#39;s in full control of her emotions. Braka can&#39;t stop smiling, she WAS the right choice and Braka saw it on the plane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At once Alpha!&#34; I run to the pack house and run up the stairs and bang on Alpha Kayden&#39;s  door. Nothing... I start banging again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT THE FUCK?!&#34; Good he&#39;s up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My sister requests you and your brother right now.&#34; I tell him calmly even though my blood is boiling. He suddenly looks very pale with wide eyes. Does he know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me link Marcus and put something on, I&#39;ll be right out.&#34; A few moments later Marcus&#39;s door is open and he comes out and Kayden comes out too. They are both wearing jeans and a t-shirt, and both look nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this about?&#34; Kayden asks. I just stare at him trying to see if he is capable of something like THIS. I just give him a glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will see... and I hope for my sister&#39;s sake you are unaware of this, follow me.&#34;</p>
