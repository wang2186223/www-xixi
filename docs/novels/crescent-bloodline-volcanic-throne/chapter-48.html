                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! Loiza! I was looking for you.&#34; I take a deep breath trying to focus my control, the past event had Aryn on the edge, but I stop and turn around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Kayden?&#34; And he gave me the most adorable puppy dog eyes, this mate Bond thing is going to be the end of me, but maybe Nina is right, I don&#39;t have to go through the mating ceremony but at least his company will comfort me. The moment I caught his scent I was able to catch much more control over my anger than I had just a few minutes before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Beta came to me to tell me to find you and spend some time, I guess they decided that we meet before the ceremony instead of afterwards.&#34; And I can already see Bayoán&#39;s plan in motion, calm down Izzy before the ceremony so she doesn&#39;t fuck it up. Reasonable enough...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I&#39;m going to the kitchen to see if I get something to eat and verify how they&#39;re doing with the meal for the feast... Do you want to join me?&#34; Yeah cuz I&#39;m really hungry, but I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m in the mood for so I&#39;ll just let Domingo work his magic. And he gives me this sheepish grin that looks adorable and it makes me just want to jump him, Aryn is putting very naughty thoughts in my head, so I lock her up, I can&#39;t handle her right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would love to join you My Lady.&#34; I think he doesn&#39;t know that I know what he&#39;s trying to do by referring me by that title, he&#39;s not really using it as a title so much as a reminder. And I turn and stop him immediately putting my hand on his chest unconsciously and I suddenly get hit by the electricity between us which makes me gasp a bit, his chest is rock solid. How am I going to spend time with him with all these thoughts I have right now, hell even I want to start painting him not in a canvas... Damn you Nina for putting that in my head!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get one thing straight, how about instead of using that really cheap trick of trying to remind me that I&#39;m your lady you just call me Loiza and I call you Kayden, and we do away with titles all together? Fair enough? It&#39;s starting to get annoying, and I&#39;m not referring to you I&#39;m just referring to the whole pomp and circumstance, the bowing and solutes, the titles and hierarchy. Understood? I really need to unwind and get away from everything for a bit.&#34; And I offered him a puff of my joint. &#34;This will help you relax a bit, we can get some food and a bottle of wine and have a little chat, how&#39;s that?&#34; He takes the joint awkwardly, apparently he doesn&#39;t indulge like our people do. I don&#39;t mind it, it&#39;s a personal choice, but for our people it&#39;s actually a very sacred plant. It&#39;s now or never, I have to ask the questions to which I need the answers to ASAP, and determine which will be my next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It sounds like a plan, afterwards we can go to a place that is quite secluded which can help you get away from it all and unwind like you want, we will not be interrupted and take another bottle of wine there, is that okay Loiza?&#34; Even better, if I don&#39;t get the answers I need today, I will need a place for our mating ritual where we will not be found for at least a few hours. I just really hope I&#39;m wrong. But why is it that I already feel heartbroken? I put those thoughts aside and focus on food because I don&#39;t remember the last time I ate and that might be contributing to my bad humor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you said Kayden it sounds like a plan, now PLEASE let&#39;s get some food I am starving and starting to become hangry.&#34; He lets out a laugh, and it sounds as magical as the Úngar Planes of Avalon, where the unicorns run. He escorts me to the kitchen which smells heavenly and we are met by Roxanna... &#34;Cacique! What an honor to have you join us!&#34; She says bowing, and I give Kaden a short look that says &#39;See what I mean?&#39; And he gives me a knowing smile. Still my lips are smiling and pleasant towards her, she&#39;s only following protocol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember when I was in the other end of that protocol towards my uncle... he used to be quite formal when it came to it. My mother treated Yadiel as his Tía, but Uncle Gúarionex was a different man after he came from the war, or so my Mami used to say. Even she who was his sister called him as Alpha and not brother, it did not make him cruel, on the contrary, our old Alpha was a very kind man, he just expected respect and formality... I guess Dad also had a play on that, he was always so rigid with protocol, still our uncle always treated us with a lot of love, and his Luna is my milk mother, whom I adore... I would call my Mom , Mami and Luna Isla, Mamá. And then I feel awful for not having the time to go see her, but as a Luna, I know she is more than understanding and going thought mate grief Counseling, the last thing she needs to be reminded she lost her true child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roxana, it is very good to see you. I&#39;m looking for your Master, I&#39;m very hungry but I really have no idea what I want, can you help me?&#34; She smiles. &#34;Of course! I will fetch him right away Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sit on the kitchen island and Kayden gives me a suspicious look... &#34;You don&#39;t know what to eat? Why do you call for another man to tell you what you want to eat?&#34; I smile because I can feel a little bit of jealousy from him... If only he knew!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, you will see in a moment, but this is important Kayden... You have to trust me. Understood? Once you see it you&#39;ll find it quite amusing. Remember what I told you about Kappas?&#34; And he gives me a small smile with a raised eyebrow with a little bit of suspicion... &#34;I remember.&#34; He says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let them work their magic!&#34; And I give a mischievous smile and a wink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well well! Look what the wolf dragged In! Literally...&#34; And he looks Kayden up and down. Making me want to laugh but I hold my tongue. &#34;My dear, you have been doing splendidly from what I hear.&#34; And this is what I love about Domingo, you don&#39;t really have to say anything for him to know the right words. When my Quinceañera came along, the only birthday party I allowed, I was still in my silent phase and no matter what people asked what I wanted for my party I remained silent. When my mother took me to have a consult with Domingo for the catering and the cake, my silence was not a barrier for him. Everything I could have wanted for that special day was met. He worked and lived with his mate at The Alpha Fort as personal chef for the Alpha and his family, we could have lived there as well, but my father preferred to have a little bit more privacy for us in our home very nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Domingo I thank the Goddess that you were spared... this is Alpha Kay---&#34; And in usual Domingo fashion he doesn&#39;t need many explanations and he is never formal, which I know my uncle greatly hated, but was always forgiven because of his skill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah yes! Your golden mate, but there is no need for formal introductions my dear.&#34; And I give him a wide thanking smile. &#34;Neither of you have broken your fast and it&#39;s the afternoon! This is completely unacceptable Izzy, what have I always told you child?&#34; I&#39;m so grateful that he is just treating me like myself, with all the stress I&#39;m having I really need this. But Kayden looks at me with even more suspicion and I raise one finger asking for a minute, he clearly looks uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never allow your stomach to grumble for anger is sure to follow!&#34; I remember these words from a few years back from days of sparring with Cleo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Atta girl! Alright mija let&#39;s see...&#34; And he gives Kayden and I another look clearly making him a little skirmish and I can&#39;t avoid but smiling and looking the other way. When I&#39;m able to control my smile I look again into Domingo&#39;s eyes, and I can already see that he is linking his assistants and pupils... Awesome!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Kayden, what do think about being paired by the Goddess to such a lovely creature as our beloved Loiza?&#34; And again he just stumps Kayden, and I see my mate gulp hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am truly grateful to the Goddess for this treasure... I haven&#39;t been able share much time with her but I hope that changes today, she&#39;s everything I could have dreamt of!&#34; And my blush starts raging and my heart speeds even more than it already was! And I am so grateful for the jading potion and scent suppressant, otherwise he would have already scented my arousal... I can&#39;t imagine how my control will be tested tomorrow. Domingo gives him a thoughtful look, but says nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just remember Alpha, she&#39;s a precious flower in our garden... I need one more piece of information, do you want what you want or are you willing to experiment with something new, something different you have never had before?&#34; And I see Kayden&#39;s face become extremely puzzled, but I see also that he&#39;s looking inside his mind to give the correct answer. And I think he needs a little rescue, it wasn&#39;t completely fair of me to expect him to trust a process he knows nothing about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax Kayden, this isn&#39;t a test, it&#39;s just he&#39;s trying to make sure that you get what you want. Do you feel him reading you? He knows already what you want to eat, he just wants to know if you&#39;re willing to experiment with something different.&#34; I give him a reassuring smile and he gives me a gorgeous smile back with unsure eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember when I asked you to trust me? Now you have to trust yourself, it all depends on you. Do you want what you want or are you willing to experiment? There is no wrong answer!&#34; And he smiles with a blush. And I can see that he&#39;s becoming a little more comfortable. And in my mind I am thanking Domingo so much, this is something that could help me to try to persuade Kayden to move his pack to Karaya. And then his smile starts to fade but his glare becomes more intense...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love to experiment new things, so I&#39;m definitely open to that option!&#34; And Domingo gives him a smile. And like magic a plate is places in front of us... Mofongo stuffed with shrimp! And this is definitely what I wanted! And I start laughing... &#34;Domingo you wonderful man! I could just kiss you! But I don&#39;t want to have to execute Alberto for threatening his Alpha!&#34; And we both start laughing, and it seems that Kayden is actually understanding the joke, giving me a questioning smile instead of an angry jealous face... He seems to be a fast study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No my dear, we would not want that! I love that man to death but Goddess help me with his jealousy! Now Buen Provecho, dig in!&#34; And he goes to the refrigerator and brings out a jar of acerola (A type of Caribbean cherry) nectar... my favorite!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I already know what I&#39;m going to eat tastes like, Domingo is basically giving me my favorite Caribbean soul food. So I just wait a moment and look at Kaden expectantly, I really want to see his reaction. He looks at the dish... &#34;Alexis has never prepared this, what is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my favorite dish, but we have to dig in now, it tastes differently when it&#39;s cold.&#34; So I decided to start myself so that he sees that I&#39;m not going to drop dead! And it is heaven! And I can&#39;t help the soft moan that escaped my lips. And Domingo starts laughing hysterically and he always says the same cheesy line... But it never gets old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And once again Chef Domingo has touched a woman in a place her mate will never reach!&#34; And we both start laughing even though Kayden had became very serious. Which actually makes me laugh even harder!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember, TRUST me... Just like the other joke you will understand this one in a minute, so dig in!&#34; And I reassure him through our mate Bond, and he takes his first bite. And his face just lights up. And he looks at us with wonder, and Domingo and I start laughing again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now, Alpha, I have touched YOU where Loiza will never reach!&#34; And this time we ALL start laughing... He&#39;s starting to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is absolutely right you know? I will never be able to have the skill to cook like this! And now you understand the magic of Kappas and why we are willing to sacrifice our lives for them!&#34; And I reached my hand over Domingo&#39;s and Alberto be damned! &#34;Thank you old friend.&#34; And I turned to Kayden and give him a large smile and he smiles back in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Old?! Speak for yourself Izzy I am still the epitome of a virility and fabulousness!&#34; And he smiles and goes back to the refrigerator and brings out two small bowls and puts it to the side... &#34;For after my dear...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This has to be the best thing I&#39;ve ever tasted in my entire life! I never thought a man would be able to touch me this way!&#34; And I cannot stop laughing, is this how it&#39;s going to be? To be near him always? This goofy happiness! He takes a sip of the nectar, and his eyes widen looking at the glass. With a strange look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is something wrong?&#34; I ask. And he gives me a look... &#34;Nothing and everything is wrong, if you don&#39;t mind mate, can we speak of this when we are alone? And through the bond I feel that he is loving the food, but I sense confusion a little bit of anger. We scarf down the food and we reach out to the little bowls and it just gets better!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s breadfruit flan... my favorite type, it&#39;s basically a custard.&#34; He takes the spoon and the minute is hits his mouth he cannot stop smiling but I still feel something strange in our mate Bond. Then to top it off Domingo places two little cups of cortaditos, a very strong but delicious Cuban coffee which will keep you awake for days if you&#39;re not used to it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure there are larger coffee cups in the cupboards, Alexis has made flan for us but not this type.&#34; And even though there is a strange feeling in our mate Bond, I can feel so much pleasure coming from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no! You have to trust me on this, you do not want large coffee cup for THIS type of coffee. That size is more than enough!&#34; We finish everything up and Kayden asks Nancy for a bottle of their best wine with two glasses. But I stopped Nancy and told her that the glasses will not be necessary to just uncork it and we will be on our way. Kayden looks at me strangely. &#34;I know you want to make this romantic mate, but it&#39;s going to be a bother to carry those glasses. We can just drink it out of the bottle right? Remember we&#39;re leaving formalities behind between us.&#34; And he takes my hand in his and places a soft kiss on it sending shivers down my spine and making my heart race like a Fire Faerie!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re absolutely right gorgeous.&#34; We thank Domingo for the food and I asked him how the venison is coming along, and he assures me that there&#39;s nothing to worry about, and to just go out and relax.</p>
