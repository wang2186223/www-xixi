                <p>Phoebe POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janaína told me the incident with the tiara earlier. I will go later to the lab to have my own inspection, I linked Ayana to meet me there, as fae we have been working overtime to perfect the contract and deal to be offered to them. And since we&#39;re both fae we work very efficiently since we know all the tricks of the trade, yet we are both young and in Faerie there can be hidden meanings to old coded laws and most fae are old enough to know every detail. Good thing I know every single one. We have been each other&#39;s rock in this endeavor and have grown very close, I understand why our Queen loves her, I am glad she&#39;s here today, she also knows about my pregnancy and besides keeping it quiet, she has also been performing the traditional rites and rituals of our people helping me focus those ancient powers to ensure they pass down to my daughter. But nobody knows the full truth of who I am... Yet they are already slowly awakening and as usual he is waking first</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving for the extensive training of the soon Alpha Guard, Jacob made love to me for a week, claiming me every time, many times ensuring that emotional bond and feel that he is mine and I am his and that he loves the child inside me. My sweet wolf takes my breath away... He made love to me so many times and so many ways that just to think of me makes me blush and springs my smile to life! How cruel was my life before this, yet it was imperative for me to have this genetic coding to guide the Blessings I bestowed upon her even before he laid eyes on her...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides the whole problem with the tiara, which I knew she would hate, but we wanted to establish a FIRM Dynasty look... The Tongans, don&#39;t heed much to that, but Romanian wolves and those from Japan do take appearances more into account. Regardless she still looks majestic, the Navy Blue brings a strong, dominant look at the same time complimenting her skin tone, also it was always her color. Her arms are bare and suddenly I have a strange vision of her chiseled athletic arms with the same ribbon tattoos on the Lady Moira&#39;s arms. Those tattoos are for the protection from DEITIES looking to do harm, I guess it has come to this... Since the Lady Moira serves Selene she sometimes must do business with deities that are not fond of The Moon Goddess. I don&#39;t have the power of a Seer, so if I got this vision, it&#39;s from the TOP... Just like our Queen has her orders, I have mine. I link Ayana what I saw. As the newcomers enter the Court she gives me a questioning look, I give her a short glance and slight shrug and return to look forward and paying attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What do you think it means? Daevas aren&#39;t devine.&#39; She asks. I have to pay attention but now my head is full... Shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;If I got that vision it&#39;s an order! The tattoos we&#39;re using are not enough... The Marks Selene and Gaia gave her are not enough either, daevas aren&#39;t devine, yet their Master might be!&#39; Even I feel the alarm in my own mind and the moment the thought leaves it and reaches Ayana she starts to panic. Yet she composes herself quickly and helps me channel my own emotions to steady me... I might not be an Alpha with Betas, but I do have Ayana! I am so thankful to Gaia for granting me a fae friend... As fae folk we can manipulate each other&#39;s mood... That&#39;s how we entrap so many humans to our will and mischief... Ayana and I have been using it like the Betas use their power with the Queen, we read the other and project the emotion we feel the other needs. Fae folk are naturally selfish creatures, the whole &#39;pack&#39; life goes in complete opposition to our own nature. So Ayana and I doing this would be considered taboo to our people, yet being able to join the Link of the pack it has help gide us to unlock our natural powers to a different level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Phoebs just focus on NOW! I got this... I&#39;ll link Bayo so he can contact Moira, I&#39;ll also contact every Priestess to get the full information on the tattoos. Breathe, calm your mind and focus now, our Queen needs you.&#39; Blessed Be!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m good, thank you!&#39; I open my mind to her magic and I feel myself fully again in the NOW.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the entourages from the three new packs enter I start feeling a little distress within the link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Do you feel that?&#39; Loiza asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I do.&#39; And look at Shomari who is left of Janaína... Beads of sweat on his forehead, yet his face remains of stone. I look around the room... Others from all packs are in the same state, and I can&#39;t help but smile and laugh inwardly!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;My Queen, one of our new Betas as well as many people at Court have found their mates!&#39; I feel her join me in laughing in our own Link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I was so uneasy before, but this is the Goddess&#39;s mercy!&#39; I look as she simply stands up slowly showing her stature and grace and just lets the massive room fill with her laughter, especially when she saw the Alpha of Slujitorii Zaitei... Alpha Ogawa and his Beta, Alpha Palu of Mahina Katoa and her Beta and Alpha Albescu of Enpaiamun. It was a three for three with the Alphas and two Betas! The top leadership of all three packs was in our pocket! This IS the Goddess&#39;s mercy indeed! All of them trying to keep their composure but failing miserably because they had just found their mates and since we are in Karaya itself, just the thought of rejecting a mate could make someone sick even if their not Osupa. Then I notice that I&#39;m feeling like before Ayana was helping me channel my emotions and look at her... She is blushing and can&#39;t take her eyes from Alpha Ogawa and I look at him and he is trying as hard as he can to look forward, yet he can&#39;t stop stealing glances at her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me all for my outburst! I had a very lengthy and formal welcome for you all and yet It seems to me that this was a match made in heaven and we are already family... What say all of you?&#34; She doesn&#39;t even have to do any coaxing, they are all in that immediate spell of the mate Bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Ogawa seems to get a link from his Beta, she looks impatient too, gulping while not able to rip her eyes from Shomari and his aquamarine eyes almost glowing for her... Her hair is all white yet her eyes are black pools of ink, she must have an exceptional mutation... The Goddess must have a very special plan for their offspring!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hai! Slujitorii Zaitei is in agreement with what you say great Alpha! These matters were really already settled before we left Japan, I come to you today with gratitude and humility for your generosity. I am restful to submit to you and call you My Alpha.&#34; And as he steals another look at Ayana he and his entourage go to the floor and give a very low bow on their knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Ekkk! He is super hot! Are you excited?&#39; I link Ayana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Dude I am so sorry for leaving you hanging! I never expected it to be THIS strong and fuck yeah I&#39;m excited! Look at him bowing, his butt is too cute! By the Goddesses, I feel like I am going to explode!&#39; I can&#39;t help but smile and giggle inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Did you see Shomari&#39;s face?! I am using all of my self control to stop myself from wiping his drool!&#39; I see that she gazes him and then gives me a controlled smile trying to avoid from turning into straight up laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;It is funny, but I must ask forgiveness right now my friend.&#39; Huh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Why?&#39; I can already feel her mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I did link Bayo your vision and he understands that you wouldn&#39;t get a vision like that for nothing. So since he understands the severity of the situation, I am going to leave it to him to deal with Moira and settle with her that Izzy gets those runes and incantations tattooed on her arms... What I&#39;m saying is basically... I&#39;m totally ditching you after this to explore that cute butt my mate has!&#39; For a moment I almost did laugh out loud!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Copy that! I think we can take a few days break from redacting the fae folk contract so that you can get your wits on high alert again, we are almost done anyway!&#39; Now that she&#39;s found her mate she will definitely want to bring the most primal side of him to her will, that&#39;s why there&#39;s a fetish among the fae folk for warewolves. Despite how different we are, our sexual need is even higher! Hell, you can walk into any of the fae Courts and you could run into an orgy around the next corner, right in the open and if you wanted to join you are most welcome! When I was mated to Jacob at first I thought that he was sweet and we were both vulnerable from what we went through, I loved having him inside me and him showering me with his love. Koios was never this full of passion, good riddance! As I started to bring more of my own culture he was stunned in a very pleasant way... I told him the scoop of how it is in Faerie and it would rile him up until one night he fully released his wolf Anzu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I now what you are doing my little faery princess and don&#39;t worry, I have chatted with our sweet Jacob and his trauma is in check now.&#34; At first I didn&#39;t know what he meant until he shred the dress I had on, picked me up and placed on the table and feasted on me. I don&#39;t even know how he tied me up and hanged me fully open to him my legs tied open like I was kneeling... And even after HOURS and me BEGGING for mercy he didn&#39;t relent. I literally passed out! It didn&#39;t take long for me to regain consciousness and I was still in the same position I was basically a swing and he was sitting in front of me stroking himself with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jacob? Anzu? What are you doing?&#34; I didn&#39;t care about the position I was in, I wanted him to fuck me again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m admiring your beautiful self my faery princess and I can&#39;t help but touch myself.&#34; I was annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well stop stroking yourself and get here and give me what&#39;s mine! I forbid you from ever touching yourself anymore! Do you hear me wolf?! That cock is mine ALONE!&#34; As his grin widened and he stood up and started fucking me again without mercy, I was in heaven and just the thought of him touching himself and he himself taking what&#39;s mine filled me with the most lustful rage ever that when he felt it he let me loose, making me jump him. It was the most primal we had been with each other until that point. We don&#39;t hold anything back from each other anymore, we have been going easy since I got pregnant... It&#39;s harder for fae to have children since our lives are so long, Goddess knows that this might be the only child I have with my sweet wolf, so we both agreed to take it easy. That was another reason he chose this training, but he will be back a month before the birth, Daniella is still trying to figure out the due date... I&#39;m already a hybrid myself! That night when we finally finished I noticed Jacob had put Anzu back a while back... It was all HIM! I realized that day how compatible fae folk and warewolves were and fell more in love with my wolf. Oh yes! Ayana is going to love her sex life now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other Alphas followed suit and submitted to Loiza, they were impatient to meet their mates and since most of the most important negotiations were already settled before they came here they just kneeled before her in submission. The Chalice to initiate them was brought and the ritual was completed. The second our Queen declared them Osupa they all skipped the pleasantries and head off to their mates. Loiza sat again on the wooden throne and took it all in while smiling. She called Janaína over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>J: &#34;Yes Alpha?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>L: &#34;Víctor is almost back from the lab, Shomari will have a 48 hour leave to settle with his mate and Bayoán linked that he has something urgent to attend to, make sure that it&#39;s reported to me the minute he returns. Make it very clear to both of the others not to disturb Shomari... Once the 48 hour leave for Shomari has ended, Víctor&#39;s will begin. Before that I need the three of you to work with OPIA for a plan for the best extraction for Chandrama kee Chhaaya, I just got a link from Director Gloria that they have accepted every term and every member passed every test and have been cleared.&#34; Loiza stood up and started descending the stairs to go and join the Luna in welcoming them all as is custom and we followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do they still have the Alpha in silver chains?!&#34; Janaína asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...&#34; Loiza answered with a hint of boredom over it. &#34;... The Beta couldn&#39;t defend keeping him alive anymore and ended him.&#34; Janaína gasped at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, it must be VERY bad over there for him to choose that path... It must be devastating to a Beta! And if it has come to that they need a very good plan to get out. Natalia is over there with Lola, Arasibo and Susana leading a team so there is SOLID backup inside, we need a SOLID plan based on STEALTH. They have been getting bombarded from the reports so they don&#39;t have the strength for a blaze of glory fight, if the Beta had to that then hope is almost dead to them. Tell Gloria to contact the head of the Saint Germaines she&#39;ll know what I want once you mention them.&#34; We see Víctor coming our way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did they find anything?&#34; She asked but already knew so she raised her hand. &#34;Nevermind, I know there&#39;s nothing wrong with it, it&#39;s what I SAW... Anyway, Beta Janaína will fill you in, we have new members to welcome.&#34; She said taking my hand to join her and Luna Isla who is already working the crowd with her charm and gentle touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you command Cacique!&#34; He bows solemnly, these are newcomers so we still want to keep a certain air of formality and Janaína takes cue from Víctor... She is definitely an exceptional Beta. They go to their office as my Queen wraps her arm at our elbows with mine and we go where the Luna is. She was always a sweet girl, it was cruel what that bastard did to her...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well Phoebs, the day started weird as fuck but this must be the smoothest welcome of new members so far and my mood is great again I really want a beer how about you?!&#34; I&#39;ll tell her tomorrow about the vision and will hold Bayoán&#39;s report. I guess I&#39;ll let her have the rest of the day without any more worries, she deserves to enjoy what she&#39;s reaping for a while.</p>
