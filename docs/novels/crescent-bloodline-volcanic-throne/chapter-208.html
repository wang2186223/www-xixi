                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You have to be fucking kidding me! After hours of starting this training I could understand Bisabuelo&#39;s and the rest of the Guerrero family&#39;s frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they told me this training was BRUTAL that&#39;s exactly what I was expecting! But after just two days of watching this brouhaha I have had enough! I wasn&#39;t born an Alpha but I did get training from Mami, and Braka would put Cleo and me to practice different Alpha crippling moves to end our enemy, but this training is FINE!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s EASY, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s doable and actually quite fun... When I have a Guerrero Alpha sparing partner! I actually had a nice bonding time with Abuelo and it REALLY got fun when he went all out! He DID get me in the end but I definitely learned A LOT! I totally get where Mami got her moves and she never went easy with any of us, except for Nina. If she won you KNEW you WOULD be in AGONY for hours! And that&#39;s exactly what I got from Abuelo... We went all out for little over an hour but in the end, he had more tricks in his arsenal, I even cheated using some of Phi&#39;s strength. He still beat me like a PUP! At least my cousin Yolanda, Tía Constanza&#39;s daughter is an Omega and we both got to work on speeding up the healing to my face, ribs, broken shin bone, clavicle and broken arm! Then we worked on Abuelo! His poor hands! Ha! He looks like shit too, but damn he has a nasty right hook and his wolf Chaka really got Aryn&#39;s hind leg good! We couldn&#39;t stop smiling at each other!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mija! I must say that was very impressive and still you only was unconscious for less than two minutes! Shit! If you&#39;re mother were alive you could EASILY defeat her! I could see her training! If this is now I&#39;ll make sure that you can take Caguax before long! He defeated both Yureibo and myself and even Braka lost to him! He is so far the strongest Alpha of the pack. Basically if it weren&#39;t for the fact that we all know you can eliminate us with a though, it&#39;s him who&#39;s the strongest. He was going to challenge Gúarionex... We we&#39;re still discussing it as a family. The Real Dynasty was dying out and Yadiel was physically strong, there&#39;s no denying his godly blood as well! I imagine that it if weren&#39;t for the eruption, it would still be the Real Dynasty who ruled...&#34; We both felt suddenly uncomfortable, and I took his hand in mine and he gave it a little squeeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if every family in the island seeks recognition, the Alpha&#39;s have little other choices than that of Warrior. This is their gift... Power. But even in the wild, a bloodline of the pack can be finished by the wrong decision. It&#39;s our wolf&#39;s nature! I feel the rush of power through my veins and everyone who shares my blood shares in that rush of power. Yet the loss of the other Alpha still hurts... That pain is shared by the pack. The pack is life! And for the Alphas that life is OUR LIFE! Their hearts beat with your own... It took me over a year to re-learn that! Ura was so patient! I don&#39;t imagine my life without it... It frightens me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine Abuelo, I intend to see this through! I want to see how far my body can go without my gifts! I would like it if you could keep training me and spar with me as you did now, ok?!&#34; I could feel my clavicle bone snapping in place! Fuck! That&#39;s ALWAYS a painful heal!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayden couldn&#39;t stop linking me with his bullshit! I mean seriously! He was never the BEST at warfare and he could never outsmart Athena! Give me a break! My beloved has other traits I adore!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Ugh! WILL YOU FUCKING STOP! THIS IS WHY ATHENA AND ARES BEAT YOU AT THIS EVERY SINGLE TIME!&#34; That shut him up!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I had to spar with the others I had to hold back... Even with Kayden! It wasn&#39;t fun anymore!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as stated one of the main problems... Nudity. Ugh! I&#39;ve seen enough!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tío Yureibo, would you mind it if I stepped in?&#34; He sat down for a break and had some water and fruits, cheese and cured meats brought to us. We usually keep lunch light when we train and a very heavy meal after... Lots of puking goes on in training, no need to strain your stomach more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any suggestions mija? Don&#39;t get me wrong, they&#39;re strong and have the potential to be easily more powerful but they hold back I just don&#39;t understand. Is being naked THAT unconventional? I mean, we do it ALL the time when we shift!&#34; While Tío Yureibo, myself and most of the Guerrero family Warriors went to the outside showers to wash the sweat off, and sat down on soft thick white cotton blankets with woven bamboo mats underneath naked allowing the wind to dry us and cool down our bodies while we had a lunch and a break, the rest of the Alphas were scampering for their clothes or putting on some robes! It was quite the spectacle!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kayden, Tony, Hiroto and Cesar came over to sit with us...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHOA! What are you doing?!&#34; I asked stopping them and Kayden was about to give me a kiss when I stopped him while taking a bite of a banana and breaking off a piece and putting it in his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked what do you four think you&#39;re doing? These mats are for hygiene and not having the grass up our ass! Did any of you at least wash the sweat off with water before you put those robes on?!&#34; They all looked at each other like if they were caught with their hands in the cookie jar! I get up and tell them to follow me to talk with them in private... Kayden has a robe for me and I just started laughing at the sight! His eyes were BEGGING me to put it on as I shoo it away, it&#39;s hot as fuck today!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter with you guys?! You&#39;re missing punches, not avoiding hits on time and thinking too much on your next move! And those robes... Do you know WHY they&#39;re white?&#34; They look at me like lost school boys. I purposely closed my link with all of them, including my golden God, I won&#39;t be doing him any favors if I give him a crutch here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because they look nice like that?&#34; Oh Cesar! I facepalmed myself and Tony smacked him in the back of the head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guys, why do you think you stink after a workout?&#34; I&#39;m going to have to baby bird feed here! Did these wolves HAVE any civilized ways?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because we sweat?&#34; A question Tony?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, that&#39;s a good start... Have you ever smelled sweat Tony? Like the second the first drop leaves your skin?&#34; He looks at the others looking for help. Oh my Goddess!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok I&#39;m not even going to ask about how you learned basic biology. Guys, sweat is just water being expelled from your body, the PRIME reason for us sweating is to lower our body&#39;s temperature. As wolves our metabolism works up to 7 times more than that of humans because of shifting, rapid regeneration, etc. So we sweat way more. Now here&#39;s the fun bit... SWEAT doesn&#39;t have a bad odor, however the BACTERIA that feeds off your sweat DEFECATES on your skin... THAT&#39;S the stink you smell! Bacteria POOP! Now imagine how the person who makes sure those robes are cleaned and disinfected must feel every time he or she has to pick up after you! It&#39;s rude as fuck, so spread the word! The robes are white because that kind of washing will wear of the dyes used for regular fabrics, that&#39;s why training robes and break mats are usually white!&#34; The look on their faces was hysterical! Kayden KNOWS this information!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I head back, we have to change this training method pronto before these bad habits become deadly to them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tío Yureibo don&#39;t you think we should first help them with being comfortable in their own skin? I mean, we know the consequences of a split second errors in combat for OUR people. However I think we CAN teach an old dog new tricks! I say we teach them to CRAWL first!&#34; He smiles at me! And looks at them looking awkward and us not even flinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yureibo hasn&#39;t left the island in a very long time except for Blood Moon, he&#39;s in charge that their family&#39;s legacy fighting style lives on and he can&#39;t be risked to go off island. I will admit, I&#39;m still in pain but I think I can get the knack of it before the Full Moon and be able to continue after I give birth! And I&#39;m pretty sure Abuelo should know how to spar with me pregnant. He definitely knew how to measure himself! These techniques are pretty challenging and definitely if I didn&#39;t have my Priestess powers I&#39;m pretty sure Caguax COULD challenge me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However by Karaya Law having a ruling Alpha recognize your linage whether it be through the male or female line makes absolutely no difference! Caguax would be basically challenging HIS own family not for THEIR sake, but for HIS own and it would make him look very dishonorable giving reason to his family to discard his name. NONE of us want that! I look forward to getting the beating of my life with him! I imagine SEVERAL times! But as long as I get to learn this it&#39;s TOTALLY worth it, Kayden will get it eventually and I desperately need him to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever else our parents are our first Masters and I want every single one of our pups at their strongest, especially Deacon, I will miss Jade like crazy but I&#39;ve little by little made my peace with it, but I KNOW the power she will wield especially under Moira&#39;s tutelage. So during that time I need to make sure Deacon will be trained and educated as well as possible and Maco and Bayoán have been talking to Johanna about the curriculum for every pup of our family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this seriously necessary?!&#34; That&#39;s right... He REALLY disliked the Spartans, to be fair so did I, but their training methods are the most humans have come to how WE train. We always have medical support, but during training we practice like if we were already in REAL battle and our sparing partner our true enemy. Just as they won&#39;t show mercy in real combat, neither do we in practice. I clicked my tongue. I keep my link closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which part? The getting your ass kicked to actually LEARN how your opponent should feel after you&#39;ve defeated him! What on Earth is it that you guys do during training in your packs?! Somebody gets a scratch and everyone goes to the nurse? Here we will go to an inch of our lives to make sure that we tried EVERY SINGLE strategy to the very end! How do you guys think you&#39;re going to survive this training? Do you think this is brutal?! Dude we&#39;re going to go to do something in the training that is going to stop some of your ridiculous behavior!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I link every single Alpha there, break time&#39;s OVER!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok guys I KNOW that most, if not ALL of you are quite bashful when you&#39;re naked. I got news for all of you, we&#39;ve already seen all of your balls and coochies! It&#39;s not like it&#39;s something we haven&#39;t seen before! So for the rest of the day we are going to focus on ONLY that... Now STRIP! ALL OF YOU! This is an order!&#34; They start taking everything off slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will all learn that you&#39;re NOT A HUMAN! You&#39;re a WOLF! YOU&#39;RE AN ALPHA! You&#39;re bodies are perfectly sculpted weapons! So what if we see you? We&#39;re your brothers and sisters! So what if your enemy sees you, he shouldn&#39;t be able to get away from you alive to say shit! I heard that the Guerrero training was BRUTAL according to some of you... It&#39;s bullshit! It&#39;s hard as fuck but you all have the strength and potential to take this on easily, but you being self conscious about your nakedness is making you loose focus! That ends TODAY! We want that whenever you are challenged by an enemy, that you are the one ALIVE at the end of the battle! We want it to be YOU who returns home to your home and to your families! It will very likely be uncomfortable and awkward at first but It could really cost you your life guys, I&#39;m serious here! I have been in the field enough to know that changing from your human to your wolf and back again and actually caring if you have anything on could cost you dearly! One of our Beta sisters is undergoing a terrible ordeal because of one wrong split second move and it wasn&#39;t even about something so trivial as showing a boob! She&#39;s been recovering for over two years afraid of her own WOLF, afraid of EVERY wolf! Still... She fucking SURVIVED! She was naked and about to lose her arm and still she prevailed! Tonight while all of you are cuddled up in your comfortable beds not having to worry about security, I command that you investigate what happened to Moraima. She&#39;s still healing, but she&#39;s HOME and we along with her family are making her whole again! For today and every day I want everyone to strip the moment you step foot on this training field, no robes will be available and you will wash for breaks! Nobody wants to spar with someone who&#39;s filthy, that&#39;s another type of training you&#39;ll get eventually! If you have an opening from your opponent you will take it! Don&#39;t hold back because they won&#39;t either, so if you feel like you&#39;re going to break a bone, DO IT! This is ridiculous! If you hold back in training how will you know how far you could go in real combat? And so what if you&#39;re in pain? There&#39;s always someone who will help accelerate your healing so you can get back out there! You ALL saw how my own Grandfather kicked the shit out of me, but I didn&#39;t back down until he put me down. OSUPA DON&#39;T BACK DOWN EVER! WE FUCKING SURVIVE EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING UNTIL WE DIE! THAT&#39;S THE ONLY MOTHERFUCKER THAT SHOULD EVER HAVE THE ABILITY TO END YOU AND EVEN THEN YOU FIGHT HIM! DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND?!&#34; At least they were standing straight and not focusing on covering their balls! Meanwhile the Guerrero&#39;s were riled up!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;CACIQUE, ARRUFFF!&#34; And the afternoon was filled with the howling of their wolves.</p>
