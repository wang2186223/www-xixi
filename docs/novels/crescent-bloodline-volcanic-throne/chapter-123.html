                <p>&#39;Nina I need your help!&#39; I couldn&#39;t help but smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Well, well, the Mighty Alpha needs my help...&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s been a lot of stress over the past days. With newcomers roaming around getting an understanding of Karaya life before starting new duties and training soon, this mission to get the pack from India, the indecisiveness of the other three packs that wanted to join, that weird fiasco with the tiara and the pups must be wreaking havoc within Izzy&#39;s mind. I have stress and I am not in position of power and responsibility she has and still Tony and I decided to skip our Heat. The Goddesses couldn&#39;t have given me a better mate! When I told him my plan for our Heat he was on board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oui chèri, I want your wickedness just to myself a little longer.&#34; I have my responsibilities and he has his. Every Alpha born is going through excruciating training, as the packs strongest warriors they carried that weight. The Real, Reyes and Guerrero families are the main Alpha families on the island and the Reals were now gone through the male line, all that is left of it is my siblings and I. The Mirabal family is a Legacy Beta family and yet now we too belonged to the Alpha clans. However, the Guerrero family is the best at Alpha training, even more so than the Reyes. Since the Reyes family is so occupied with official affairs and the training of the new elite guards for Izzy, she asked the Guerrero family to train every Alpha born. They are BRUTAL as fuck and every day Tony comes home like it&#39;s his last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having a mate hasn&#39;t made me soft... Well only to him and he&#39;s sworn to secrecy! When he gets home and I see him like that I can&#39;t help but pamper him silly. I already have a massage table in the balcony, that&#39;s where I strip him and as much as he stinks I douse him in heavenly oils and massage every inch of him until I feel he has fully regenerated... He ALWAYS falls asleep! He looks adorable like that! Still I wake him for the hot bath I ran for him, and always he needs a minute to catch his bearings... I know the horror he has seen, I know it weighs heavy on him. So I usually sit with him letting him remember where he is, he finally accepted therapy and we make sure to go surfing and go for runs in the mountains as often as possible, his heart is so much lighter after our days just enjoying Karaya... Those are the days that primal fucking turns into sweet lovemaking that always ends up in the balcony with a bottle of wine and a good joint. Yet when he trains he doesn&#39;t complain... I have never heard him complain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One night after we vented our day with each other and were just lying down I told him my concern...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mi amor, if you want to bitch about the training you know your cute French ass can bitch to me---&#34; He covered my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shhh... The training is perfect, I feel my strength grow by the day...&#34; And he wrapped his arms around me. &#34;... I won&#39;t let anything happen to you mon bel amour. So there&#39;s nothing to complain about...&#34; He became very silent, I felt he wanted silence. He has made friends and the French have been adapting really well. The racing alone has risen their popularity in the tribe. Yet my powerful Alpha wants silence and peace. And since both Izzy and Frey have given birth we have returned Circle night once a week, sometimes twice. I can feel how much he loves those moments, even if we miss Natalia... As much as I bitch about her, it&#39;s bullshit and we all know it, I fucking love that woman. Those in the circle really are those I love most and Frey is awesome! Sometimes I look at Izzy looking adoringly at Frey and I know how she&#39;s feeling. Family relationships can be either simple or complicated, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s room for grey area here. As one of six siblings, I KNOW the complicated side and each of our relationships to each other determine how close that bond is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone on this island knows that the Mirabal siblings Bayoán and Nina are not fond of each other. And it&#39;s true... To a point. I don&#39;t even mind outsiders giving him shit, I saw the bitterness between him and Kayden and I was Team Kayden all day. I never thought he really did anything to garnish such harsh bullshit from Bayo, I hate it when he does this! He reminds me of Dad&#39;s own shit... Dad... Sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I always thought that my relationship with my siblings depended on their relationship with Dad... Maco, Bayo and Izzy were the closest to Dad yet, I could never hold a grudge to Maco. I&#39;m the second born so in my memory there was a time that Maco was my ONLY sibling and he is so much like Mami... Hay Mami... I miss that woman so much some days that I don&#39;t want to get out of bed. Antoine can read it instantly and links the project managers of the city in the mountains that I&#39;m working on, that I won&#39;t be coming in that day and to not to disturb me. Then he usually links Daniella to check if there&#39;s anyone available to speak with me that day, before leaving to train. I guess I can&#39;t complain, he pampers me too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayoán is the third born, but he was born the Beta my father wanted desperately. He was by Dad&#39;s side 24/7 becoming just as arrogant as him, Goddess how I loathed when he would agree with Dad at the dinner table over anything, even if I agreed or not. He IS funny though, I will give him that! In that he was very different from Dad, and to be fair he did DISAGREE with Dad about me leaving the island! It&#39;s just that he had to stand by him because he was the heir apparent to the Beta position and he didn&#39;t want Dad to lose face or to demean that very important position within the pack. I understand his conundrum publicly, but privately he could have done much more and I think I&#39;ll always be pissed at him for it. I hate politics and unfortunately in our pack you must learn to manage them, the problem is I suck at it so I lash out. That&#39;s my superpower! I would be chewed up at home for the shit I did but just the fact that Beta Ayato had another scandal to deal with just would make my day!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Bayoán comes Ura... My favorite brother even though I know I&#39;m not his favorite sister! I guess that&#39;s just how relationships work! Ura has always been the quiet one, I&#39;m talking about not talking for days! I remember Mom being very concerned, I mean the boy was Gamma born, his place in the pack was set as a Warrior. Yet when my mom saw that he achieved every single goal and excelled as a fighter, hunter and tracker she calmed down and just accepted him as he was. It didn&#39;t mean he was shy he just didn&#39;t care for interaction, which in a pack of werewolves is very rare. It&#39;s maybe why he was granted a Twin Soul mate. He doesn&#39;t have to speak with her! Their brain is in complete synchronization!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came Izzy... She was an adorable little sister! And mischievous, too! She was Gamma born just like Ura and Maco, another Warrior and just as she came we were told her destiny would be different and she was taken to Avalon. That was a confusing time for us... She was five years old! We had bonded... Were is she going? Why? We ourselves were children. And then she came back at 14 and she was a stranger. I could feel she could feel it too. I actually had a conversation with Bayoán during this time, since he was so close to Dad I wanted to know what Dad&#39;s plan was with regards to this. And he had no clue either, he too was pissed about it. She was worse than Ura! We even barely felt her in the link! And then we were really concerned because she was outside of the link for 9 years, I can&#39;t imagine my own mind in that kind of silent torture but she seemed to really like it. Seriously, for the first few months I thought I was living in the same house along a psychopath who had the ability to blow us the kingdom come! Suania was younger and she was afraid of her. To top it all off she had a title and we had to basically submit to her as if she was the Lady Yaya, even Mami!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About 2 months after she arrived, one night at the dinner table we were all just talking... at this point we had accepted her silence and the Lady Yaya had told us that she would recover and would be part of the pack, that we have to be patient. And then her link came alive...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Please don&#39;t be afraid of me, I&#39;m trying. I&#39;m really trying... Can you guys please not bow to me, or call me those things? I know they make you do it, but can you at least not do it in the house? Please!&#39; She broke down crying and Ura who always sat by her side cradled her in his arms. We were STUNNED! We were her family and we were ganging up on her treating her like a freak and outsider. In a way I think it made Dad feel like shit... The Mighty Beta of the Osupa didn&#39;t take into consideration that his own daughter might have feelings and might not be cool with US, into his masterful calculations... Pff!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think that&#39;s why he always over compensated with Izzy... She wasn&#39;t a Beta and yet he was teaching her things that only Betas understand and she looked like she would catch up on it without a glitch. She was even able to pass Dad&#39;s stupid test with that dumb car! I wanted to light it on fire, I wonder where it is now? I hope it&#39;s so underground that I will never see it again. And even though she started talking and completely behaving like another annoying sibling I think I started disliking her because of her relationship with Dad too. That is until she definitely beat me at destroying Beta Ayato within the tribe! I still look at the video and it makes me laugh! It makes me want to go to her room and kiss her! That girl won my heart that day, I may bitch at her and give clap backs at her, but Izzy will always be my favorite sibling bar none! She literally liberated me that day! She had openly challenged Dad and he accepted her challenge and she defeated him fair and square albeit humiliatingly along WITH Bayoán. I don&#39;t think there is a member of the pack, let alone our family that has asserted themselves so strongly against such High Hierarchy within the tribe, especially at such a young age and come out that victorious... She was a Priestess, so she already had the tribes respect, but for anyone who thought of messing with her. She shut that shit up for good!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I remember was that there was definitely so much to my little sister I didn&#39;t know and apparently it was worth my while to listen and since Ura was always with her he would tag along and Natalia was the one who invited us to the broken fort that&#39;s how The Circle was born! And then Izzy asked what we were smoking, and we laughed at her and told her it was weed, but she looked confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cannabis you mean? THIS is what think you&#39;re smoking?&#34; I remember being so high that even I was confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, cannabis... &#34; We just looked at each other confused at this point. She just stood up saying that she would be right back. That girl came back with a grinder and the best weed I had ever smoked in my entire life grown by hers truly! Natalia gave birth to the circle, but Izzy made sure it was awesome!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalia and I have always been close, we&#39;re loud and obnoxious and we fucking love annoying everyone. Don&#39;t get me wrong, she is a BOSS negotiator when she is at work, Tía Ayiti did not waste any time with her talents. The point is she&#39;s fun to hang out with, when we&#39;re in The Circle Izzy and Ura learned to let loose! And the two siblings I met in that circle are awesome people that I love to hang out with!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suania was the last, but to me she stuck always by Maco&#39;s side. She and I have always been okay, it&#39;s just that sometimes she gets too obnoxious and bossy, way more than me. Her studying the whole Izzy&#39;s pregnancy actually had me shocked! Maco and Suania have always kept to themselves and that&#39;s fine too in a sibling relationship I guess some are just closer than others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when all of this happened and there was no more mom and dad I guess it did bring us closer. I have even interacted civilly with Bayoán, I know that Izzy is also his favorite... It&#39;s the one thing we are 100% in tune with. I am in fact very invested in Izzy&#39;s plan for the future of our Island, I want her legacy to indeed be fruitful and be an important page in our history. Our people will survive this, just as we survived the times of Conquest. Last night Antoine told me he DID want to go through with the next Heat. We were still thinking about it, him just saying it and the determination in his eyes to protect us... How can I say no? We have already agreed that there will be no disappointments and it would be ride or die. I needed a relationship like this in my life. I go to the Shrines once a week in gratitude... Izzy needs Kayden here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m getting out of bed woman! Calm your tits!&#39; I hear a pause. &#39;Izzy?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;How did you know?!&#39; What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Hades woman are you going through something?!&#39; Another pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Look get your ass over here! We&#39;re opening The Red Light District again today remember?! Even though Natalia isn&#39;t here I would like ONE FUCKING day to have fun before I start training again. So I declare A Circle Excursion!&#39; Did she start already?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Did you start without us, can Antoine have leave tomorrow?!&#39; We were off today, but in Circle Excursion we go all out! &#34;Babe wake up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Deal! I still have to go the next day with him anyway, I&#39;m going to be training with the other Alphas. Should be fun!&#39; Yeah it&#39;s always fun for HER! I&#39;m a Kappa our training is different my duty to the pack lies elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Fine, we&#39;re on our way!&#39; We haven&#39;t had A Circle Excursion in a while. Now she&#39;s going through with this training and I already heard that after the Lady Magdalena&#39;s Heat, the Priestesses go back to training, again. Only two Priestess came this time, the one from Japan was younger than Izzy and not as strong, that was a harsh video on the news that day. The Priestess helped hold of the attacks while they reached the boats. What witnesses saw... What our people saw... And the reports! Antoine usually leaves the room but he understands that I&#39;m trying to mentally prepare for the worse. Unlike the others, I never served under OPIA, I never went on the field as a spy, Warrior, bodyguard, diplomat... The times I have left Karaya was study and leisure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon Alpha, you need some fun and we are leveling you up!&#34; He gives me a lazy smile. He pulls me to him making me fall on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmm, what mischief are you up to mon bel amour?&#34; As if!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No mi amor, this is all your Alpha.&#34; He raises his eye brow... He so hot!</p>
