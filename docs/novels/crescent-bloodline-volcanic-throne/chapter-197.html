                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After coming back home Izz has just been out on the balcony with a joint and a beer with Sophia nibbling corn from her. She&#39;s always silent when she visits with Medusa with that lost sorrowful look in her eyes. She fed the pups and I took over to put them to sleep, I just started talking to them about my mother... The Goddess Leto. I linked Mónica to take them to the nursery, they&#39;re sleeping soundly through the night now and last night they slept between us. The combined scent of all three made me sleep like a log!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel her anger through the Bond. Her fantasy of skinning Athena, Poseidon and Zeus alive while listening to their screams of agony... It&#39;s always in the back of her mind. I used to be an obedient son... What an idiot! I would skin my father if I could too!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s also worried about Cymmy. People think that because your a god it means you can do and have everything you want... If giving my Beloved woman to his brother almost drove me mad, him giving our daughter to that animal made me want to kill him! I guess this is TWO I owe Hera... SHIT!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Mónica and Danika took the pups I joined her in the couch outside and sat down next to her wrapping my arms around her, she snuggled laying her head on my chest making Sophia fly to her perch. I know she doesn&#39;t want to talk about Medusa... Artemis doesn&#39;t like it either. I don&#39;t think that is a wound that will ever heal in both their hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I looked over Tamara, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything that can be done about her memories, she carried the Mark of Venus. I will return to Hades when Persephone has word from Gaia and I&#39;ll summon Hecate then, I think that liberating Ares from the spell will work.&#34; She scoffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Mark of Venus... What a fucking cunt! Even if SHE dies that girl will never remember Ares. Why are they like this?! It&#39;s just petty and cruel and childish! Kayden I don&#39;t care about those cunts, I want my little girl in my arms! And here I was hoping for a longer break before being pregnant again but I&#39;m not leaving her to be found by your fucking father.&#34; I&#39;ll make sure that she&#39;s well taken care of, she won&#39;t be alone this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know sweetheart, I wanted to kill Father for that. I&#39;ll talk with Daniella to verify your next Heat and with Orocobix so he can give me more details about getting her here faster in the chance the Heat takes too long. You know that I&#39;m going to make sure that this pregnancy goes well, right Love?&#34; I could feel her nodding and taking a deep breath to help her calm down. We usually just make love and have children easily, this time we have our child waiting for us to do the deed so she can join us already! The moment I fertilize Izzy&#39;s egg, Cymmy&#39;s soul will possess it and her consciousness will be transferred to the zygote. Her Goddess body will die... It HAS to be precise! By Gaia, I have to inform Moira to not allow her to watch! Those sickos will have to WATCH us and be on the dot the moment the egg is fertilized!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I remember, I saw the moment that Keaton impregnated Lydia with me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She starts laughing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really still thinking like a wolf who has adapted to HUMAN ways instead of your own nature! My Love, she won&#39;t care! I didn&#39;t care about my Mami doing The Nasty with my Dad!&#34; Ugh! That&#39;s nasty as FUCK! And she can&#39;t stop laughing! At least she&#39;s laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The moment your disgust hit your emotions I got a hard whiff of that! Ja ja ja! At least your adapting to your Kayden persona better, you&#39;re adorable my beautiful sun god!&#34; She wraps her arms around my chest getting herself more comfortable and my heart feeling as light as a feather with her in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will be so lovely to have her with us again, the good thing is that she is of water, when she starts awakening it will be simpler for her.&#34; I&#39;ll also make sure that she gets the proper Marks and tattoos to make her invisible to Olympus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed quiet. I feel all the things that are burdening her mind. I know what her next play will be and I doubt any creature of the supernatural world would have come up with a more creative way to take over the human world with their own weapons! This will definitely be interesting and for this she wants Marcus, Antoine, Ishaan, ex Alpha Stefan, and myself leading this. Depending on the meeting we will have she&#39;ll verify with the Betas, her Council and OPIA on how best to proceed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina said that the Historical Society will buy everything that we have to sell, Nía, Freya, Tali and Morgana are over at the house picking and choosing what dresses and heirlooms they want to keep.&#34; She just wants to talk about simple things... I kiss the top of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to go over and check out what you want?&#34; She touches the gold pendant she had around her neck of a Taíno Sun symbol from the town of Utuado, located in her family&#39;s original island. One of many heirlooms of her family, but this one she&#39;s been wearing since her days in Avalon. Kiskeya put it around her neck when she left, her father had commissioned this simple pendant the size little larger than a quarter, when him and Kiskeya were teenagers. The Mirabals hail specifically from that part of Borikén and the symbol is present in many places around their main house like the heads of the chairs in the Dinning Hall. I remember seeing it on her the first time I saw her getting off the plane in Blood Moon but I didn&#39;t pay it any mind, it&#39;s ironic that she was wearing a golden medallion symbolizing the Sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, Nina knows exactly what I want and had already put it in my room so it wouldn&#39;t be taken, she&#39;ll later restore and fix anything so it will be ready for Morgana&#39;s spell. Most of the items I want I already have and use... That&#39;s why Lola isn&#39;t partaking either, years ago we went through everything with Dad&#39;s permission like if was a shopping spree and we have been using that ever since. Babka had A LOT of really nice clothes and in perfect condition, so we didn&#39;t find the need to spend a ton of money when we had bitching clothes at home and since nobody was using it, Dad was happy that his Mom&#39;s clothes were being given new life! When the others saw Lola and me dressing in Babka&#39;s clothes they saw how good we looked and decided to rave the vault too! We really only have to focus on the stuff before those eras and we can always borrow anything we want, but it&#39;s best the people enjoy it! Paco, Jorel and Papo have been bitching to their family for years about keeping so much crap! Everytime we go visit, especially for the Day of the Dead it&#39;s a pain in the ass! But having ALL of it is ridiculous! Besides, the REALLY good jewelry we usually don&#39;t take ownership of since most of it is very unpractical to wear everyday! We just go to the house and borrow it. I don&#39;t even like having The Guanín here, I accepted the other jewelry because it&#39;s made specifically for me and my reign, but The Guanín isn&#39;t mine! I just hope it&#39;s a fad and I can put it back in it&#39;s glass case soon!&#34; I was never taught to be frugal at all, but Keaton did teach us A LOT about managing and investing money and both Marcus and I did go to business school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know why Keaton did it... We were going to be his fucking retirement administrators. Either way I am grateful for those lessons!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beta Aymaco went further with how he educated his offspring... Even Ayiti is quite frugal. When Maco, Amelia and Bayo sat with Marcus, Ishaan, Tony and myself so that we would have a look at the family&#39;s books our jaws dropped. They weren&#39;t as ridiculously wealthy as Antoine, but they were wealthier than the rest of us combined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The purpose of sharing that information wasn&#39;t to show off either, again Antoine&#39;s fortune alone is greater than theirs by far. But since we were all chipping in to the family&#39;s wealth they don&#39;t think it&#39;s honorable that we are kept in the dark of where the money we&#39;re chipping in is going. As Betas, Marcus and Ishaan are way better at numbers than the rest of us so Bayoán will continue his Beta duties while Marcus and Ishaan help Maco and Amelia with the family&#39;s finances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in spite of their wealth they&#39;re all still pretty frugal, except for Nina, and even she thinks some of the stuff we have is absurdly expensive for it&#39;s value!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re going to spend an obscene amount of money the LEAST you should do is spend it on something that matches the price tag! And really? You were complaining about Tommy&#39;s suits?! Those ARE WORTH their price! Three million dollars on ONE car... Pffft!&#34; She scolded her mate, Marcus and me. Tony just nods and tells her she&#39;s absolutely correct! It&#39;s funny as fuck! But she has a point. She herself is a high roller, but through Tali&#39;s and Izzy&#39;s memories, Marcus and I started to understand what she meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everytime Nina makes a purchase she studies VERY carefully what she&#39;s paying for... The materials, the craftsmanship, the design, the tailoring, she&#39;s extremely meticulous! Since she does most of the cooking and is in charge of what crops will be grown in Hacienda Florencia and the orchard she wants for the house she&#39;s been checking different seeds, roots and some samples... So far she&#39;s only been satisfied with two exporters. She also wants to build a greenhouse at Hacienda Florencia for speciality crops... Fruits and vegetables that are harder to grow in the tropics yet are used in special dishes. Already many chefs are asking for certain crops! It was a very good idea and needless to say we were pretty impressed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These crops will be more expensive, but since they will be locally grown the chefs and their pupils want them badly because the fresher the produce is, the better the food they prepare will taste helping them make a name for themselves in the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Khatris, Ishaan&#39;s family are very alike to the Mirabals in their frugal nature. Either way Marcus is helping Adam sort out his own finances, him and Aaron stayed in their family home back in Virginia, so they really didn&#39;t have major expenses and they have some savings and bonds their parents left them. It&#39;s not as much as what we have but it&#39;s a good sum, and him and Umbros insisted in chipping in. Aaron and his mate want to stay in their apartment and have already the paper work to fully purchase it but are going to send the boys to study and be trained at The Fort. Either way Adam told Umbros that he wants a house by Caney Lake in the new city, Nina&#39;s going to take them to check out some plots next week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ishaan&#39;s cousins Ishika and Rian are Kappas who are particularly gifted in agriculture, they are going to be moving into the village close to the hacienda with the rest of his large family, since it&#39;s in better condition and can be updated much faster. After she&#39;s done with handing everything to the Historical Society, Nina will join them to start the ball rolling there and she will also be close to the Caney District to finish the city. After that&#39;s settled she&#39;ll start with everything else that they want to do to the house and she&#39;s already chosen two particular lots in Karayita that she had already checked out and Maco, Ura and Tony are going to check out tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of how the market has crashed in the human world, the companies we brought took a hit but it&#39;s bearable, Tony&#39;s is already being worked on and him and Louis have been coming back and forth to put it back on track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The humans are going crazy trying to sell off their real estate to have more liquid founds, so the vineyard Keaton wanted is now little over 30% cheaper! Marcus was ported to California to purchase it ASAP!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wolf Skull and other local tech companies had already developed an A.I. system for crop nurturing and collection that has been working locally for almost a decade. It will be implemented there to restore the roots of the vines that are in the best condition and help them reproduce... For this Ishaan&#39;s younger brother Viyaan who&#39;s a pretty savvy Beta in business too and his mate Cleo Reyes, along with his Auntie and two of his cousins who are also gifted Kappas at agriculture are going to take over and report what is needed and they have already requested Warriors to scout and have security at the perimeters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casimar and Braka are going to send Daguao and a few more members of their house and some other soldiers until a security system can be put in place. Not only do they want to make sure Cleo is secure, they want to scout the market as well. The world&#39;s economy is crashing but the economy here had a massive boost because of the mermaids and the collective wealth of the packs that had any. Pasha and the others want full citizenship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already Víctor is extremely excited by the fact that his Heat with Magdalena was successful and Jana has become very friendly with Sybil and Corelia so they&#39;re both drafting a new deal with the mermaids to make their citizenship oficial. They have indeed become an extra security system for the island and it&#39;s waters and I have already explained to Pasha about Izzy and me when I informed her about Jade&#39;s scent. She already knew the story about why she exists and about what happened to Amphitrite, she just didn&#39;t know it was us!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza is our friend, she protects us and we her and her pups and Karaya. I will mobilize some of my subjects to monitor HIS movements and no mermaid shall mention HIS name anywhere near these waters, yet we still will not say anything to your son unless you or Loiza expressly command it. I do not wish to expose Lord Triton.&#34; Now that she&#39;s fully informed she knows how to instruct her people better. Izzy had already commanded a special bunker be built at the bottom of Caney Lake in case the mermaids needed shelter from threats from the sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry...&#34; I tell my sweet mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what Love?&#34; She KNOWS! She starts laughing again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to apologize my Sun. I know you&#39;re trying to protect me, you always have and I will always love you for it!&#34; She sits up and taking my face in her hands kisses me deeply... How I live to be loved by her! She looks into my eyes smiling...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re to old for secrets between us Kayden Black and I know all your tells, we still don&#39;t really know what bargain we reached last time, but I have a feeling now that it has nothing to do with lies. But between you and me there can never be lies or half truths.&#34; She starts laughing again making me smile. It&#39;s true and it makes sense, even when we have tried we always failed at lying to each other, that&#39;s why we wanted the Twin Soul mating more often than not... I think we didn&#39;t do it last time either. Leaving only one possibility...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not dying together... Before we would be born at the same time, die at the same time. I think it wasn&#39;t just this or last time, I think this is the third time we&#39;ve done this. I&#39;m not sure. But it&#39;s fine Beloved, I have a strong feeling that we made sure to plan it perfectly. For some reason I feel like all these obstacles we&#39;ve been having have a purpose and that this island is the principal player in Gaia&#39;s plan.&#34; It would make sense. All these islands are basically the ruins of Atlantis. The greatest civilization ever recorded... It&#39;s not called The Antilles for nothing!</p>
