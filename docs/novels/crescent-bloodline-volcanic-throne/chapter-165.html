                <p>Aymaco&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I go to our room to shower and get ready for what I suspect will be a delectable blood bath, I see her looking over the bay from the balcony on the chamber level. She looks so beautiful in her light orange mid calf sundress caressing her ever growing belly, I start getting a little hard for her. I never would have thought how yummy it would be to make love to a woman when she&#39;s pregnant. She catches my feelings and looks up at me smiling, shaking her head and rolling her eyes making me chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Later tonight after everyone is gone you horn dog!&#39; She links me while blowing me a kiss. Beneath all her shyness brought by her pain and ugly memories, I have found her to be very passionate in bed. Her hair is growing fast, so Nina French braided it and decorated it with some orange blossoms from the garden and insisted she wear great-great grandmother&#39;s yellow emerald cut diamond earrings with big teardrop pale yellow pearls, we ALL know them from her portrait. It did give her a beautiful elegant air despite our casual attire and everyone in the family will understand Nina&#39;s meaning from such a gesture, those are Adelola&#39;s wedding earrings. Amelia wasn&#39;t uncomfortable by Nina&#39;s touch, she&#39;s little by little getting better, giving me hope that she will heal fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to hand it to Nina, she HAS changed a lot since meeting Tony, she&#39;s now very invested in the family, and this is BEFORE her little scuffle on Izzy&#39;s birthday. She has even invested some of HER own personal founds to fix up the house... everyone in fact had chipped in. We could have dipped in to our family account but we haven&#39;t touched it. Nina hopes we all agree with selling the carriage, along with most of the things in the sewing room, as well as Adelola&#39;s and both her daughters Asenath&#39;s and the Lady Cacicaná&#39;s dresses to found the projects for the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I totally agree, she&#39;s the only one with the skill who gives maintenance to all these heirlooms we don&#39;t use and can be better handled by experts and be enjoyed by the whole tribe and it would be a substantial amount to still keep clear of the amount in our family account that garnishes us very good interests. Just the fact that she&#39;s not going on a spending rampage is impressive onto itself, she was never the frugal one. She only wants to keep Adelola&#39;s wedding dress and still she&#39;s asked Morgana for a protection spell for it once she fully restores it. Yeah, our great-great grandfather wasn&#39;t satisfied with her being merely his mate, he wanted to call her wife as well. Funny for such a powerful and brutal man. He even admitted in his diaries that it was she who held power in this house and had him wrapped around her fingers, being the only woman he ever obeyed, including his own mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was reading this with Em we thought at first that she had cast a spell on him... yet her grimoire doesn&#39;t have any spell that could do that and as the daughter of a slave, she expressed in her own diaries that those practices to control and posses another were highly taboo for her. And from verbal recounts passed down our family and the Ollers, it&#39;s said he would sit for hours gazing at her as her portraits would be painted. By the Goddess mercy! Just the fact they had 14 pups was evidence enough that he was very enthusiastic when her Heat would come and in her diaries she would mention that he would make love to her every single day. He was also VERY descriptive of the beauty of EVERY part of her body. I&#39;ve been digitalizing all of the old documents, diaries, grimoires, while Nina has been cleaning all the paintings being extremely careful with their enchantments, she is a BOSS when it comes to all this, then takes pictures of them to add to the digital record.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;ll remember that promise preciosa!&#39; She chuckles and nods at me to get ready. I wave back that I&#39;m going to it. Izzy&#39;s little pep talk to us has kindled a little fire inside my sweet mate; I haven&#39;t seen her as determined to let go of everything that happened to her and inside the Bond I&#39;m feeding that flame. She&#39;s worked very hard to be as prepared for today as possible, we can&#39;t expect our mates to learn EVERY detail of our tribe AND our family in such a short time, our history is very rich and feeds off of the history of three continents, the colonization period alone is complicated enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I&#39;m showering I already feel Bayo, Nía and Tía Ayiti arrive, I feel through the filial Bond Umbros giving Izz and Ura a hard time, he didn&#39;t used to be as moody when we were kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I go downstairs I finally hear them arrive... &#34;Dude it&#39;s your fault, she didn&#39;t want to use her Alpha voice on your dumbass self pendejo, you&#39;re lucky! I would have just dragged you all the way here by your fucking braid letting everyone in the streets see and record it... I can imagine it would have been trending by dusk!&#34; Shit, already Urayoán is in a bad mood and I can feel Izzy&#39;s pissed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead mamabicho! I fucking DARE you to try!&#34; Umbros retorts. Sigh. I look at Lola and she just rolls her eyes and goes to the back of the house where the kitchen is to help place the table with Nía and Bayo. Izzy just waves at everyone and goes to Nina who hands her a lit joint, I go over and take it after Izz takes a hit to take one myself... Not yet at the table and it has begun!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter with you boy! I raised you better than THAT! You&#39;re acting like a fucking pup!&#34; And Ayiti just slaps him into submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ura comes over and gives me a look asking for the joint while going to get a shot of rum. I follow him to the bar nook in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here, give me one too bro.&#34; He takes a hit and pulls me in for a hug and hands me a shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C&#39;mon let&#39;s get a beer man, we can get hammered later.&#34; He assures me. And he gets some frosted beers and he hands one to Izzy, Nina and myself as Em comes towards us and after giving me a kiss she surprises all of us by going out to where Umbros and Ayiti are and opens her arms towards Umbros asking for a hug with a gentle smile! They all look at me but I&#39;m just as shocked. Umbros knows what happened to Amelia and is shocked himself yet he doesn&#39;t dare deny her and takes her in his arms and both him and Ayiti look at me with a questioning look. I just smile... She&#39;s defusing the situation at the cost of her discomfort yet, I feel her discomfort for only a minute. Umbros took control of his anger to not hurt HER with it and we can feel his aura change to give her comfort and she looked up smiling at him, and his face softened as he put one hand on her belly by instinct and she allowed it. She softly patted were Tía slapped him as to say &#39;that&#39;s enough of that&#39; and he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Izzy nudges me with her elbow... &#39;You see? I love it when I&#39;m right! Ha!&#39; She&#39;s such a sore winner sometimes! I&#39;m so glad I found a new career and was able to stay home after she came back from Avalon. I was so pissed at how Mom and Dad were handling it! I saw how she and Ura gravitated towards each other, so we had our conversation of him watching out for her while I would be away and he would tell me everything that would happen while I was gone. He was angry too but he was never confrontational... Usually if he wants to fuck you over, he&#39;ll do it quietly behind your back and leave no trace that it was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sometimes DO think he IS great-great grandfather&#39;s reincarnation, let&#39;s face it, Em isn&#39;t wrong when she compares him to Vito Corleone... The guy WAS basically a sea mobster, and he ran that little endeavor from inside The Fort while serving as Beta of the tribe. His main competition were the Reyes and Saint Germaines but he was in a position of more power in the pack and as a Beta was faster at double crossing them at every corner. We&#39;re good now, but our families have always had a little bad blood, that&#39;s why Dad an Admiral Brutus invested so much for a mating between Izzy and Casimar. He wanted her badly!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So even though I&#39;m not a fan of confrontation either I stepped up as the eldest son to demand Izz be treated as FAMILY not a Priestess! However, Dad and even Mom still were of the mindset of keeping to the more rigid old ways. I left for my mission the next day, my mind on my little sister playing chess against herself in the yard... It was a heartbreaking sight! What kept me in check that night was the fact that I was watching her in the balcony upstairs, my feet on the stones that make up the chamber floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they were cut to be added to the construction of the house, our great-great grandmother enchanted them with a soothing spell to make sure that by bedtime just walking through a halls the children would be soothed and relaxed. For a woman with 14 children it was genius! It made bedtime a lot easier! They only added the largest slabs and Imotonex gave the Ollers the smaller ones for the construction of their home. They have always been our closest allies in the tribe and we are bound by blood and love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Adelola and her mate and their JOINED power and determination which molded our place of power in the tribe. Imotonex made us what we are, but without Adelola he wouldn&#39;t be shit and he KNEW it! That&#39;s why he loved and cherished her so dearly. It was in fact HER idea that they go into piracy and in his diaries he states that he made love to her so hard that night because of how aroused he was by her macabre idea, that he was able to fertilized her with the Lady Cacicaná, who later also became Priestess of Changó, without Adelola being in Heat!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s so fucking awkward to read all this intimate shit about your ancestors but Em finds it romantic! Then like a sicko, THAT would make ME horny and we would drop everything to go have a good fuck! I LOVE how SHE&#39;S the one doing most of the initiating lately, it helps me know that she&#39;s better and doesn&#39;t want me to be as gentle anymore. I even developed a mechanism for the rugged stone main wall in the Betas&#39; Chamber, our room, to turn into a smooth mirror like the one in the dungeons, so that we could see each other when we make love. Unfortunately, because of the rafters I still haven&#39;t figured out how to mount one on the ceiling... But I WILL get it DONE! Not only to enjoy fucking my mate more, but it&#39;s another product to add for our business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gadiel, my partner, has been my best friend and brother since we were both in the same year at school at The Fort. He was also a Gamma, yet we both really loved building and messing around electronics. When I was &#39;tested&#39; by Dad with Abuelo&#39;s car, Gadiel asked him if he could give it a go. Dad was a little over excited by his request that he allowed it after I finished. I wanted to KILL him! Motherfucker I JUST put this whole DAMN car together and they started dismantling it the moment Dad determined I passed! Ugh! Either way the asshole passed! The car was perfect! It&#39;s still a running joke between us! When I changed careers he joined me and we started Wolf Skull Inc. I invested all my savings and he his WHOLE family&#39;s savings... The difference of privilege.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If we had failed, I still had my family&#39;s wealth to back me, they were betting EVERYTHING three generations had achieved! Two GAMMAS incorporating a TECH company was a huge gamble, and yet so far business is booming and we have tripled our original investment! The Opal rings alone and the sale to the Mermaids was a HUGE boost! Now Nina is helping us find a bigger building Downtown to officially set up shop and get out of our tiny lab and storage space outside Itiba. She even designed our logo based on our family crest, only the crescent Moon is curved upward, like the Mark Izzy has on her forehead and the lettering with the name above the skull curving downward, with a chain of coquí frog Taíno symbols surrounding everything in a circle. Gadiel and I loved it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He now wants and has the means to buy the Real family ancestral home in The Citadel for his family, I was helping persuade Bayo to lean towards the sell, but after reading Mom&#39;s diary I know that we can&#39;t get involved. This will be Isla&#39;s decision alone...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all sit and Izzy insisted in a way everyone could hear, for me and Amelia to sit at both heads of the table. Now it was her telling the family what she thought... &#39;Even as Cacique of the tribe I will NOT be head our family PERIOD!&#39; She&#39;s adding to Nina&#39;s statement for Amelia wearing the earrings. And to add to that sentiment Ura went to the other end of the table to hold the chair for Amelia showing he was on board with this arrangement. Izzy sat to my right stating that as head of the pack she would back MY decisions with regards to the family. Just that alone made me feel a small boost of power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ura told me that Izzy, Lola and him had already discussed it long ago on a mission and were in agreement of their decision when this eventually would come to pass should I survive Dad. So Lola sat down to my left and Ura at his usual spot on Izzy&#39;s right side. Nina and Natalia sat at each side of Amelia flanking her, they couldn&#39;t leave her alone at the other end, for the Goddesses sake the hall sits 24 freaking people! Imotonex was such a snob... He wanted it to sit all his children and their mates, as well as the Lady&#39;s Adelola&#39;s family from the small, house should they want to join for dinner. Our people never took to the European style of dressing, but Imotonex commissioned gowns for his beloved in that style as a fuck you to them, especially in the Spanish and French style (he thought British and Dutch fashion was dull). Her Family lived in Martinique before being sold out to a another in Puerto Rico, they had to learn Spanish after a lifetime of French and Patois.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a Beta and ex-Master Spy, Ayiti assessed what those who sat where impling and she saw that it was ALREADY a majority so she sat right next to Talia accepting the decision of the majority. Suania knew what was going to be discussed today so she sat next to Nina. Umbros never really gave a damn about any of this so he just sat a few chairs from his mother to not have to look at her unless he turned his head. Epsilons are naturally very cunning and aware of their surroundings, it&#39;s what helps them be so fast on their feet and quick witted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, I see that you guys have been conspiring while I am on Leave! It seems that the first matter of business has ALREADY been settled before a single word has been said. Congratulations on your new standing in our family Patriarch Maco!&#34; He goes to Amelia and gives her a small bow in recognition and offers his hand to her which she takes and he kisses and smiles at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll wip us into shape Matriarch!&#34; I already feel her power swelling through the Bond, me and my dick joining it! She stands up and puts her hand on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bet your ass I will Beta!&#34; FUUUCK! I want to take her NOW, Izzy&#39;s Mark shines yellow and she hands me a little bottle and I take a sip of what I could smell was Jading potion. Is THIS why Imotonex couldn&#39;t keep his hands off his wife? She&#39;s pregnant yet I want to impregnate her AGAIN! And her arousal just stopped too as Nina also gave her some of the potion. Izz put Nina in charge of this so I guess it makes sense they came prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Izz, what&#39;s going to happen when the Jading potion wears off?!&#39; I feel chill again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You and Amelia are now the nucleus of our family... You obviously know that Imotonex impregnated Adelola even without her Heat right?&#39; Is she serious?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Iza, are you telling me we have NO safe period? I can impregnate her at ANY TIME?!&#39; I don&#39;t know how to feel about it... Yet something tells me Amelia won&#39;t mind it. She loves lying on the hammock in the balcony upstairs looking inside at the painting of Adelola with all of her pups, she sits down at looks at me and I can&#39;t stop gazing at her, still full of want, I&#39;m definitely claiming her again when this wears off... Her exquisite eyes gaze changes to one more assertive, full of determination and desire. Even with the Jading potion I see her nipples harden...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Now I can&#39;t wait for all of this be over hermosa! I want to fuck you so good that even the baby will know!&#39; She blushes deeply and looks down before raising her gaze back to me, licking her lips...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;ll remember that promise Mi Amor!&#39; Yeah, I have a feeling she&#39;s totally going to be the boss of me now more than ever!</p>
