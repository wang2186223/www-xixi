                <p>It&#39;s so fucking awkward that it&#39;s really messing with my head...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We have been sitting at the table for a bit now, Orocobix and Isla are holding to each other&#39;s hand for dear life. He looks embarrassed and Isla is trembling, her tears haven&#39;t stopped falling, not affecting the beauty of her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while I can&#39;t take it anymore and the Dinning Hall glows yellow. We all start feeling better, but I really don&#39;t want to talk first... I really don&#39;t want to at ALL.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, I guess this definitely falls upon my Patriarch duties... Um... Alright! Ok, so I&#39;m pretty sure that Tía told you both that we know EVERYTHING right?&#34; Awesome! Maco knows how I would be sensitive towards anything that would have to do with Mamá. Tali and I are sitting side by side holding our own hands tightly giving each other as much comfort and support as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Aymaco, we are aware. I imagine you all have questions?&#34; Orocobix is the one who speaks as he puts his arm around Isla protectively. It actually gives me comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, no shit! I&#39;m so over all the bullshit secrets already! So let&#39;s start with the SIMPLEST... You ARE our Abuelo, right?&#34; I agree with Nina on this, we must stop with the secrets within OUR family!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Guanina mija... I&#39;m sorry for keeping it from you, but I swore to your mother I wouldn&#39;t say anything! I kept my distance but I couldn&#39;t refuse a command from my Cacique... I&#39;m sorry.&#34; He looked so gloomy but held his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mami&#39;s DEAD, didn&#39;t you think maybe WE would like to know the truth?!&#34; Nía&#39;s rage is spiking through with some tears of her own... Yet at this Orocobix&#39;s composure falters and it&#39;s Isla who starts cooing him and cradling the huge man in her own arms! Ok, there&#39;s more here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry mija! I wanted to... But after so many years of being shunned I didn&#39;t want to embarrass you and get another door shut on my face!&#34; He gave me a glance before bowing his head in submission... He even went to my office after the meeting so that I would figure it out myself and was acting demanding, but he was leaving bread crumbs!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have others rejected you?&#34; I ask softly and carefully. After what Abuela did to him... To USE him at such a young age... She was a LUNA for Goddesses sake! He&#39;s never had a mate, he&#39;s been used and even RAPED for his looks... He might have become a ladies man and did all he did, but it started somewhere! I imagine all the women he impregnated didn&#39;t want to acknowledge he was the father of their pups. Yet he basically threatened Abuela to be able to be near his daughter! Still my question broke him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All mija... The only reason I was able to be near your mother was because Beatriz knew I would not hesitate. Kiskeya was my THIRD child! If Agüebaná wanted to kill me, so be it! If he found out Beatriz knew she would be dead soon, she wasn&#39;t going to give up her life so easily, so she yielded. If Agüebaná wouldn&#39;t have killed her, her family would have, you know that the Verdejos are a small family. They wouldn&#39;t have had the resources to hide this, especially when she held such a high rank! Her father demanded she endure all of Agüebaná&#39;s transgressions since they were prospering with her as Luna.&#34; He rubbed his forehead anxiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We never really had any interaction with the Verdejos that are left, they were mostly Deltas. I asked Maco what he remembers of her and he said that he rarely saw her and when he did she barely looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The mother of the first denied ever KNOWING me! Let&#39;s just say the lady is from a strong family with a lot of influence, basically they all are! Except Beatriz... I WAS going to make sure to definitely be close to Kiskeya, she was the only one I had any leverage. And even when I told my father he refused to believe that I had the capacity to impregnated a female who was not my mate and not in heat, let alone a Luna and much less an Alpha! You think I ever enjoyed being called El Guapo and all the other things they called me?! Some might love it, but it&#39;s humiliating! Still everybody found out about other children, and still none of the mothers wanted me near MY children! And then to make it worse I&#39;d never found my mate until NOW! Cacique, I forgave Isla a LONG time ago, if you must punish someone punish ME, before she turned 18 I took her to bed before she found her mate, that was truly shameful and unforgivable!&#34; My Goddesses! What has been done to this man?! Why hasn&#39;t his family found help for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all look at each other in shock, does he really think that we are blaming him? That we would reject him?! Is that what our other cousins have done to him? Ura is very shaken and goes get the liquor and weed. Nía, comes over at me in a pleading way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hush her and take her in my arms!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what they have done? Have they rejected you?! Even our cousins? Abuelo you will name them to me! All of this has to be genetically corrected! How can these records be tampered with? This is the most corrupt thing I have ever heard us do. We can absolutely steal from humans, take revenge on our enemies, but to reject our own?! This cannot remain legal in any way shape or form, you hear me Bayoán?! I want a draft of a law that absolutely prohibits such a horrible thing! Injecting lies into our pack? This is madness. I think I know how Marcus felt when we found out that they were holding slaves! I bet my ass this is exactly how they felt and it&#39;s HUMILIATING!&#34; I stand up and Ura hands me a shot of vodka and a blunt. I take it and calm down a bit. Big shots The Osupa are just as trash as the rest!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How was such a thing ALLOWED?&#34; I asked Ayiti, but she looks over at Isla. And again the roles reverse of Abuelo protecting her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you two fucking STOP it for Goddesses sake?!&#34; I take another shot and a good puff of that dubbie, good stuff!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody is dying, nobody is being banished and nobody is rejecting none of you two freako&#39;s asses! So calm the fuck down okay?&#34; I don&#39;t know if this is one of the most bizarre situations I&#39;ve ever been in, at least when I met Pasha it wasn&#39;t awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not angry mija?&#34; Oh my Goddess Mamá...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mamá... I am pissed as FUCK! Like seriously you have no idea, remember all those other times when you told ME that YOU were DISAPPOINTED in something I did? Well, Ha! How the tables have turned! You are by the skin of your teeth mija! You are absurdly lucky that the Goddesses decided to mate both of you and wash away both of your own sins! So you guys can really give yourself a good pat on the back because you must have done SOMETHING right somewhere! With that being said we&#39;re not shunning you... Whatever you dumbasses did before apparently it didn&#39;t have any major consequences... Either way I do want a law against this Bayoán.&#34; He stands up and goes to our Abuelo and shakes his forearm before embracing them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you command Cacique! Yeah that kind of practice takes away information from our database! We have to readjust all of our DNA sequences! We create most of our meds and potions with this information! It&#39;s a miracle that none of us uses meds often, but the cloaking sprays are what worries me... We wear them ALL the time! And even if our other cousins do not want to acknowledge him, it still has to go in the database either way, this is VERY IRRESPONSIBLE! How much did our father know that he allowed such a thing?!&#34; Bayoán&#39;s brain can&#39;t even compute! Yeah, no shit! These idiots were playing with our LIVES for their pride!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry mijo, but your father knew. Kiskeya couldn&#39;t hide her scent always, especially from her mate... For her, he would do anything she wanted. Your father was very good to my little girl! He knew... He didn&#39;t care for her past or her blood! For him, she was the air he breathed and even though they butted heads on many things, they still loved each other enough to have six successful Heats! This is not a small thing you can hide from your mate.&#34; No, it isn&#39;t. Of course Dad must have known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was he counting on the Guerrero bloodline for his plan for the expansion of our family Abuelo? And yes I will recognize you as my own flesh and blood in front of the pack! I will ensure that the Guerrero family name be in my linage, so please mention to your father that his Cacique COMMANDS he receive us as soon as possible. Not only that, we also mean business...&#34; He stands up and comes over to bow at my feet for such an honor and recognition among the tribe... I allow it. It will always help him remember who is the one placing him in such a place of power and I can imagine that he has been yearning to stick it to his family for decades. But I already know the powerful alliance that can be garnished between our families, and as the mentor to the strongest Alpha of her time, he knows that I know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You honor me Cacique! I vow my life to you, my own flesh and blood! I also beg for your Blessing for my union to the Luna and hope that you could wipe that memory of her from your mind mija, please.&#34; He is on one knee with his head bowed low and both hands covering his face, not daring to meet my gaze... Our most humble gesture of submission. I&#39;ve only ever seen it done once and it was Gúarionex to Moira... He is pledging his life to me and his only request is that I don&#39;t banish Isla from my heart. As if that were even possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please stand Abuelo and please no more formalities among us. I accept your pledge, but you may ask for anything else...&#34; I look at Isla. &#34;Your other request is moot, I could never grant that. I can never forget what she did but it&#39;s not for me to forgive her for it, as to your concern for the place she holds in my heart, that hasn&#39;t changed... I join in the joy of your mating!&#34; I stand up still holding Tali&#39;s hand. She lets go and goes to Mamá, I look up at my grandfather&#39;s light brown eyes... By the Goddess! Just like Maco&#39;s! Maco always had dozens of girls swooning over him but besides a few that we knew of, including a human, he was focused on finding his mate. When I said that Amelia had nabbed a hottie with Maco it wasn&#39;t just because he&#39;s my brother... Even though he IS my brother I KNOW he looks GOOD! I have to see pictures of Abuelo younger!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at my brother with a little bit of worry... Was Dad aware of their likeness and that&#39;s why he always kept him busy? It&#39;s something he WOULD do. I know I would... Kayden is very worried about Deacon but now that we are somewhat awake I know he will guide him well, I&#39;m not worried. All of our children were doting towards their mates and were very meticulous in who they enjoyed their time with before finding their them. Now I REALLY want to meet my dear great grandfather...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to Isla as we are taking in BOTH of their scents and welcome them to our filial Bond and hug her...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna no more mischief like that from you! You&#39;re too old for that mija!&#34; As I hug her I make sure to let her understand...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You WILL make amends! We forgive you and you KNOW that as much as I love you, rape to ANY gender at any age is an unforgivable act. You WILL ensure to create more education towards this and correct this behavior in the pack and you WILL ensure that EVERY living descendants he has, along with the women he had them are commanded to present themselves before me. Is that understood Luna?&#34; She kneels before me... Shit! It hurts badly! But I have to allow it to run its course, this thing must be done this way. After I allow the minimum time for her to kneel in submission I raise her tearstained face and take a clean napkin and start drying her face and kiss her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that you will never break my heart again.&#34; She clinged to my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear Mi Pequeña! I was a stupid kid---&#34; I shushed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. It&#39;s in the past and your place in my heart has not changed, right Tali?&#34; I give her a look... &#39;A little help here? I can&#39;t stand to see her kneeling like this!&#39; Talia helps her stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your command is fair and merciful Cacique, I vow to do my best to ensure that such an unfortunate event doesn&#39;t occur again and set a better example worthy of the place of respect and power you have allowed for me. I swear on the Bones of my ancestors and those of my own son, your brother by milk, that I will never fail you again.&#34; I needed to sit after that, but I had to stay standing. For humans these might be empty words... For us, it&#39;s a sacred vow. If she were to break it, the bones she vowed would be desecrated by nature, the Earth would spit out every single grain out and not allow them to rest in peace. And she included Yadiel... Tali kept observing me, she felt my distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I accept your vow Luna and I trust that you will fulfill it as you have done with the diligence you have displayed since the day you became Luna when mated to Alpha Gúarionex.&#34; We hold both each other&#39;s hands and she nods silently looking down. I lift her chin so she can see me in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep your head up Mamá, you&#39;re Luna of The Osupa and I need you to keep doing your duty, ok?&#34; She kissed my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes mija!&#34; She says with more strength in her voice and Abuelo goes to her and I let her go so he can take her in his arms. Bayo and Nía hugged him, but I&#39;m not ready... It looks like the others aren&#39;t ready either. As his Alpha he does need my comfort though, not that the others aren&#39;t important, but by our Primal animal he craves my acknowledgment. I cup his face with my hand and I feel the moisture of lone tear running down my thumb and feel his deep loneliness. Not one? Not a single one of his children or grandchildren have acknowledged him? He is in awful pain. He timidly put his hand over mine... Did he think I would strike it away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bayoán, link Elder Juan Guerrero at once and tell him he and his heir that they are to receive us at Lobo Azul at noon tomorrow. This is a private family mater for now.&#34; He gives me a sinister smirk and gets to it. I need to know what happened...</p>
