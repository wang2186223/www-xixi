                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>17 wolves have been caught so far! 17 of MY people have bought, sold, raped, tortured and used other people!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Vanessa had a hybrid elf/fae girl with a shock collar and an iron cuff at her ankle to keep her weak. The girl is half Knowing Faerie and Vanessa was using her for something so stupid as gambling! I can&#39;t believe I fucked her! The girl at least was not used in other ways, but she was a few out of most. There are even members of Blue Moon here! Marius might want revenge for this! I don&#39;t know if I can take more heartbreak from my own people. I can STILL feel Loiza&#39;s glare from above me full of disappointment and disdain. I sent the victims to our medical ward, she will most likely not be happy with that. I have to replace that altar ASAP.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get two water bottles from Vanessa&#39;s fridge, and walk over to Marcus who is sitting under the shade of a tree looking DONE, his eyes are empty and bloodshot from crying, with very dark eye bags. I imagine my eyes look similar. I sit next to him and hand him a bottle, he doesn&#39;t even look at it. I grab his hand and put the bottle in it and he suddenly snaps out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry.&#34; I say, I really have no other words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus just stays silent, he still has the water bottle in his hand, he just ignores it like he&#39;s ignoring me. He hasn&#39;t spoken to me all night and has blocked our link. He has never blocked me out before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother I am BEGGING now, I am so very sorry, I can&#39;t believe that THIS is our pack! We have members of Blue Moon, Marius is going to be pissed!&#34; I would be. And he opens the bottle and drinks in down and makes a ball out of the bottle, he keeps at it until it&#39;s so small he now it&#39;s inside one of his fists, his knuckles are white, indicating the amount of pressure he is putting. When he opens it only small plastic dust is left and he dusts it off with both his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayden, what do you want forgiveness for exactly?&#34; His voice hoarse and monotone. He still doesn&#39;t look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think Marcus, everything!&#34; He finally looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is everything Kayden?&#34; He really wants to rub it in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you being so difficult brother?! I&#39;m sorry for EVERYTHING that we are going through, yeah I guess now I REALLY know that I suck as an Alpha but---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck your pity party Kayden! Do you actually KNOW WHY I can&#39;t stand to look at you right now?&#34; Pity party?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not asking for pity Marcus, I am asking for your forgiveness.&#34; I say softly, Marcus has always stood by me, he isn&#39;t only my brother, he is my best friend, there have never been secrets between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh believe me Kayden I am not offering YOU an once of pity! And you don&#39;t even know why I am angry at you.&#34; He sighs. &#34;Have you any idea how much you embarrassed us last night, I don&#39;t mean the pack. I mean US! You and me as leaders.&#34; Great here it comes... as long as he just lets it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on, tell me, I KNOW that you will go into great detail!&#34; And now I take a sip of my water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw something I thought I would never see last night. I&#39;m not talking about the unicorns, although I do admit that my mind has not recovered from that... I saw an Alpha. A REAL Alpha, I have never seen one before and now I know what one looks like.&#34; I stand up and grab Marcus by the collar of his shirt lifting him and smashing him against the trunk of the tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying I AM NO TRUE ALPHA?&#34; And he starts laughing hysterically! I actually feel fear of him and let go and he drops to the ground still laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh dear brother, after what you saw last night, you still want to hold to your TITLE?&#34; He keeps laughing. &#34;Do you know what I saw?&#34; I know he&#39;s really not asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw a 19 year old girl who after loosing EVERYTHING and having her mate near, kept her composure. She, one so young, took the leadership role of her people and has not stopped working solving everything that&#39;s being thrown at her standing and with unyielding determination. I saw an ALPHA who is knowledgeable of everything that surrounds her. Did you notice her cleaning blood off her hands when she came out of the tent?&#34; Shit, I missed something but Marcus&#39; eyes never miss anything. That&#39;s the thing about Betas... they are usually the most observant in a pack. They are very powerful, yet the REAL strength of a Beta lies within their powers of observation, perception, the ability to discern and  analyze any situation, study and understand their surroundings and advise the Alpha then enforce that decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I noticed...&#34; I answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you notice that the patients she showed us had no wound that would merit the amount of blood she was wiping from her hands?&#34; He takes my water bottle from me and starts drinking it. I had made no connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me guess Kayden, you were more focused on not exposing our shameful secret to your mate that you paid no attention to anything or anyone in that tent? Fuck it, I KNOW you didn&#39;t, I know that besides trying to hide what our parents did you were trying to get SOME reaction from her, to see if you can smell any arousal from her part. I can tell you right now, you will fail until SHE decides, her will is stronger than yours, how do you think she was able to break Kevin? While you were trying to get a whiff of want from her, I could smell her sweat, could you?&#34; Pineapples and vanilla is all I smell from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just smell HER! I don&#39;t know if being her mate only allows me to smell HER.&#34; I feel miserable now, I really ain&#39;t a true Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems your lovely mate is SO determined to go on with her duties that she is drinking jading potion to suppress her libido and injecting a scent suppressant of some type. I couldn&#39;t catch her scent AT ALL... If she was a stranger in the street I would have no idea WHAT she was and if I was blind I would not be able to tell that she was in front of me. She probably knows she can&#39;t hide her natural scent from you, but she can disguise the other scents her body produces.&#34; Damn, no wonder The Council wants their tech so badly. I remember the little bottle her brother sprayed me with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the tent there was an old dead man with his guts hanging out. I asked about it while you were busy puking. Turns out that Kevin panicked when more Osupa soldiers came to help take the prisoners from their cells, that he lashed out at Loiza herself who was carrying the old man. He slashed the side of the mans belly... Loiza stoped Braka from killing him. Even with THAT commotion her head still registered use for the idiot! Instead of going berserk at being almost killed and carrying a bleeding dying man her mind was clear that killing him, would hinder the effort of finding the truth. As the man lay dying she was holding his guts in him and giving some of her energy to give the doctors time. In the end the man asked for her to stop, he grabbed her hand and she held him with her yellow glow to comfort him. He apparently died thinking he was held by the Goddess.&#34; Why did the Goddess waste one of her most beloved warriors on the likes of me then? Is she really just a Troyan Horse? Is the Goddess going to take her from me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have the right to forgive you Kayden, I failed as a Beta, I didn&#39;t see... Just as you are no true Alpha, I am no true Beta. I can&#39;t forgive myself!&#34; Kevin tried to kill Loiza and she pardoned him to be able to get the real perpetrators. If not there would just be a dead Kevin, and we would have to wait who knows how long for a victim to talk or go on a wild goose chase and those who are in captivity would not be free now. If as a werewolf, as an Alpha, she can control herself and thinks that fast... if she discovers what The Council did... I am her mate, how can I choose a side that will definitely want her dead? I have to tell her, I should warn them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frank comes over running... &#34;Alpha, Theo is in the dungeons but he said that The Osupa let in a Rouge!&#34; I&#39;m starting to feel one of my eyes start to twitch.</p>
