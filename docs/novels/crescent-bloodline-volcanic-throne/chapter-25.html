                <p>Urayoán&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We hunted as much as we needed, once Bayo took us where there was game the hunt was done in little over an hour. I start walking back with the rest of the hunters, Suania decided she deserved a piggie back ride on Bayo, and he is not one to deny anything to our sisters... We maybe with the exception of Nina. Suania always gets her way. I look at them and roll my eyes. &#34;You KNOW she&#39;s going to ask you right?&#34; I just state to him. He lifts Nia so that she can get a better grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No idea wh---&#34; Even before he starts... &#34;Bayo you are the ONLY one she will ask, are you going to make even THAT difficult for her?&#34; He sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you two yapping about?&#34; Suania is only one year younger than Loiza, but she lived her life like an average werewolf girl. Yeah, she trained and went through the same as any girl growing up in Karaya, however she didn&#39;t have to go through the grueling training of a Priestess. When Loiza came back she wasn&#39;t like any little 14 year girl, I had just turned 17. She spent the first few weeks in silence watching our routines, Yaya had warned us that would be normal, her WHOLE life has changed and she was studying us to learn our social cues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would spend a lot of time alone, I never cared much for being around people, or even talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she noticed, I guess since she was alone and I was usually alone, she figured we could be alone together. She followed me one day I went to hunt. I only noticed her when the pigeon I had on my sights went down with her arrow! I was very impressed, not only had that little brat sneaked up on me, she claimed my prey! I wasn&#39;t really ever alone after that day. When we would have missions outside of Karaya, Director Gloria would almost always pair us up. We could read each other and even have an alternate language only we know. Now that she is Alpha I know that we won&#39;t have those moments as before...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Loiza needs a Beta and Bayo is going to have to step up, he was supposed to anyway!&#34; I answer her plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Bayo, you&#39;re going to be the new Beta?&#34; He just kept quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop... &#34;Bayoán!&#34; And he stops and drops Suania.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nia, go with the others.&#34; Bayoán orders her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got to be fucking kidding me? I&#39;m not a kid!&#34; She says with her hands on her hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah you are, now GO!&#34; Bayo roared at her. She jumped and ran back to the others. &#34;Ura, there are other Betas... hell Víctor is in Uruguay right now!&#34; Was his answer. I wanted to punch him in the face!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You KNOW what she thinks of Víctor!&#34; I cross my arms on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, the guy is an asshole, but he is one of the best warriors and strategists of Karaya and I think would be a better Beta for Loiza.&#34; He just doesn&#39;t get her at ALL.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen to me brother, Loiza is talented and Blessed, she is powerful and smart, I know she will make the Caciques of old proud. But she is not a regular Alpha, she is a Priestess first. She wasn&#39;t raised to go through the whole political hurdles that you KNOW she is going to face. Do you really think Victor is going to help Loiza navigate that or make it harder? Especially with their history!&#34; He knows I am right. &#34;You KNOW that the moment the Goddess made herself known this little ceremony to make her a temporary Alpha had turned into a full on coronation. The Pack and the Goddess have claimed her as CACIQUE, not just an Alpha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>B: &#34;She hasn&#39;t asked me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>U: &#34;You know she will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>B: &#34;There&#39;s also Felip...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>U: &#34;Too old!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>B: &#34;Moraima?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>U: &#34;Among the missing, plus she developed that weird phobia on her last mission.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>B: &#34;That&#39;s right... she&#39;s among the missing? Shit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>U: &#34;Let me just put it this way Bayo... if Loiza asks and you deny her, I will see to it that your kid grows up thinking your a raisin in a wheelchair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>B: &#34;Are you... threatening me?&#34; The idiot asks with raised eyebrows, a wicked smile and outraged voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>U: &#34;I love it when we understand each other quickly brother.&#34; And with that I shift and run back to the western border, this is a nice spot, it&#39;s quiet. The full moon is just a few days away. I lay down my head to my paws, I hope Izzy has enough support from the Goddess to get us back home again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see some wolves on patrol start running towards the nearby lake, I just raised my head to look at the commotion. I lie my head down again and the scent hits me strawberries and eucalyptus! I jump up... Dyus is now VERY alert. &#39;MATE Ura, finally!&#39; I run towards the scent and see two guards cornering a growling ash colored she wolf. I run in front of her and growl at the guards. I decide to shift, idiots: &#34;Stan down, I am you&#39;re Luna&#39;s brother and this is my mate, I am not allowing you to to harm her.&#34; One of them shift...He is a big fella, not as tall as me, but bigger. &#34;Sorry friend I can&#39;t allow that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok... well I guess that settles that!&#34; I simply say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; The guard is a little unsure now and I wink back at my mate&#39;s wolf, and she just blinks. Her wolf is so cute!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I already told you that she is my mate and you intend to harm her. So as her mate I am just going to have to kill you both...see how simple you made it for me?&#34; And I shift back. The other wolves looked at each other. The one in human form tells me that they will escort us to discuss this matter with the Alpha. I shift back. &#34;Thank you then, escort away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has to be in human form.&#34; No problem &#34;Fair enough.&#34; I look at her waiting. Oh, now I know. &#34;Do any of you have clothes to spare?&#34; He hands me a huge shirt and I hold it up to her. Waiting to see her in anticipation and I see a gorgeous Amazon with long ash blonde hair, it&#39;s such a unique color for &#39;blond&#39; it looks like a tone of beige with white and gold here and there and piercing pale gray eyes. I am taken aback... her soft looking small lips beckoning me the kiss her. I start breathing heavy and I hear her heart pounding, I feel her relief and excitement through the Bond. I drop the shirt, take her face in both my hands and kiss her deeply, I kiss both her cheeks and she gives a little giggle that just makes me kiss her lips again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahem!&#34; I imagine this must be awkward for the guards, but I really could care less. I peck her lips and look at the beauty of her face. She stares back with a shy smile in her face, I peck her lips again and pick up the shirt from the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lift your arms gorgeous.&#34; She obeys and I slip the shirt over her, while I am slipping it down I grab her hips towards me and go to her ear with a whisper: &#34;My name is Urayoán, what is yours mate?&#34; And I lie my head on her crook of her neck inhaling her scent. &#34;I am Freya... Urayoán.&#34; I love the sound of my name in her voice. &#34;Well Freya, you are mine now beautiful, anyone who offends you offends me.&#34; I say it louder so the guards understand not to fuck with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come now Freya, we don&#39;t want to disturb these two fine guards any longer.&#34; She gives a glare at them. I take her hand and take it to my lips, I can already smell her arousal. Fuck, I am already hard. Fucking guards! &#34;Let&#39;s get some privacy, I really want to get to know you more beautiful.&#34; I whisper in her ear and she shivers at my words. She closes her eyes and nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; I tell the guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We get to the pack house I ditch the guards and bring Freya up to the room I am supposed to be sharing with Maco but he isn&#39;t here. I search through the link to see where he is and it seems they are going to the dungeons. So I lock the door and focus on my prey again and smile at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you live here?&#34; My mate asks with a shy voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really, I recently became homeless.&#34; She looks at me with an O plastered on her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry we intend to take it back.&#34; I smirk at her, I want to do so many things to her. I want to forget that yesterday happened. I WANT HER. I go to her and take her in my arms and kiss her again and she is kissing me back. I am on cloud nine.</p>
