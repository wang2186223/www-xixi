                <p>Loiza&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damnit! For a pair of almost mutes you two cunts sure can be chatty!&#34; Tony is definitely my boy but he tapped out, even Frey! They went outside to wait, or better said laugh outside, Ura linked me that Frey is giving Tony the play by play outside. We can CLEARLY hear them laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Izzy I agree, Maco is so deserving of Nina&#39;s generosity! Nina, dearest sister, do you remember that the old house could really use a nice swimming pool?! I mean, Maco and Amelia barely go out since she&#39;s still recovering from all that shit she went through, a pool would be a nice therapeutical asset for her and our MOST generous brother, a terrace would be really nice too... Do you guys remember when Mom told Dad that exact thing and WE ALL agreed with HER but HE said it wasn&#39;t necessary and Bayo AGREED with HIM?&#34; Whoa! Ura is REALLY going for her jugular today! Her face is so red with rage I&#39;m about to go outside myself to fucking laugh my ass off! If Talia would have been here today it would have gone nuclear. However...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I DO remember Ura! Since we didn&#39;t live at The Fort she thought it would be cool to have a pool with a terrace to have barbecues and family night. She sure would have LOVED that fire pit in my balcony. Hey do you think there would be space in the backyard for a fire pit?&#34; She pays the stuff and stumped herself outside to wait with the others. A small chain reaction happens as she gets outside Frey and Tony stop laughing and Ura and I bust out in uncontrollable laughter and high five each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck yeah! Ura I am so proud of you! I don&#39;t think you have ever allowed anyone to see how much you can actually talk! And the guilt trip... Uff!&#34; I kiss my finger like a chef. &#34;That was exquisite! Dude her face when you mentioned Dad and then the piece de resistance adding that Bayo AGREED, oh man, for a second I thought she was going to slap you!&#34; I&#39;m still getting my bearings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Secret: For a second I did too! But even if I stayed still she&#39;d probably miss... Nina couldn&#39;t hit a still target to save her life! If there is a zombie apocalypse Circle or no Circle Nina is not on my team! But Izzy... You added on a fire pit too! Have I ever told you how much I love you and how you&#39;ll always be my favorite?&#34; And he puts his arm around me and kisses my temple as we walk out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once or twice, but I could always listen to it again! I love you big brother don&#39;t change!&#34; He opens the door for both of us and walks past everyone and heads up the road to Ramiro&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I am sure hungry going on hangry, how about you BIRTHDAY girl?!&#34; He&#39;s not going to show her mercy today, thanks for choosing today to REALLY let all out bro! But I got to give it to him, he&#39;s keeping it light but knowing Nina she won&#39;t be able to take this for much longer and I know I SHOULD de-escalate this, however...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh boy, I&#39;m famished!&#34; Ura and I actually talk a lot when it&#39;s just US. At first it wasn&#39;t like that of course, it was silence that brought us together just like he said. We were very comfortable in each other&#39;s silence, we still are! We would go hunting or fishing and we would spend HOURS in silence, we already knew each other&#39;s cues and particular signs and facial expressions to know what we were thinking, no linking necessary sometimes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of food does this place serve?&#34; Freya asked. Ura had extended his hand to her and she caught up to us, he kissed her hand before replying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t know! I&#39;ve never been there but from what Nina has mentioned it&#39;s THE BEST place to go and you know she has the best taste of all of us, so my hunch went in that direction.&#34; I hear Tony scratching his head a few steps behind us and Nina grinding her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree, Nina has impeccable taste! Izzy I think those caramels are magical, usually I have to be my Honey Bunny&#39;s mouthpiece today he&#39;s like a big boy!&#34; Thank you Frey! I have found being an Alpha much easier than being a Mirabal, I SHOULD be de-escalating this but it&#39;s hard, if we don&#39;t clap back it&#39;s like our brother or sister or cousin punched us and we just stood there! That is unacceptable in my family, running our mouth to give our siblings shit is in our DNA, it&#39;s a Mirabal legacy! My Day and Tía Ayiti would go at it and it was like a ping pong match, and when we ALL get together including Natalia, Lola and Umbros it turns into a blood bath! Ura grabs her by her waist and kisses her hard jerking me since he still has his other arm around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s funny Love! Remembering as you always tell me I am a BIG boy!&#34; And he totally clapped back at HER making her blush furiously making me think she HAS indeed told him this! Oh Freya, Twin Soul or no, do you really think you can do this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lunch actually went pretty well, and the food was amazing and we went for the afternoon showing for Kike&#39;s show. We have never gone to Cirque du Soleil, and after watching that I really want to go to have something to compare it to live! Either way it was breathtaking, Kike booked the largest theater in The District which after watching the show I understand why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently news of my visit to the Red Light District reached the media and we had reporters outside of the theater, damn it seriously? Do guys really have to bug me today?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha did you come for the reopening of The District, what did you think of the show?!&#34; Someone asks and the others stood a little behind...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did indeed, we have already been through enough tragedy and misery, just as we are welcoming new members to our tribe I am so happy that there is room to be able to cut loose and have at least one day for leisure. The District has stood for over a century in Itiba City, making it a staple of what makes our capital so diverse and open to many ideas and artistic views and yes a little sexual fun here and there. As for the show I definitely recommend everyone to come watch it! The choreography and the costumes are amazing and let&#39;s be honest we all know the hard work, dedication and love that these artists lead by Kike and Santiago put into their shows. Everyone in the tribe knows that I have traveled a lot when I was in the field, however when you&#39;re in the field you don&#39;t always have the chance to stop and just have time to enjoy your environment. So I had never seen a show like this, at least not live, but from what I have seen from recordings of similar shows that humans do this is way superior in my opinion. So again I hope everyone shows support for The District and we will continue to work to make us whole again or at least as close to it as possible.&#34; I finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha what about the rumors that there will be another district open in Atabex City?&#34; Of course! Atabex City! Brilliant! I have an idea for our next level of fun!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can put those rumors to rest, I have indeed already approved a district in Atabex City once all of the permits go through the designated channels construction should begin. I thank you all for your questions now please excuse me it&#39;s time for this little wolf&#39;s dinner!&#34; I give them a HUGE smile and little chuckle. Just when someone else was going to ask me something I took off my smile and glared at them with and eyebrow rised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad was very good at handling the press, he HAD to with all the scandals Nina raised, yet when that day happened and I humiliated him in front of of the whole pack he responded to questions with &#39;No comment&#39;... He didn&#39;t even look at me for over a month! I was victorious and everyone hailed my praises and of course I got to leave Karaya whenever I wanted and yet... I lost the very tight bond we shared. We were both prideful but I hated Dad&#39;s silent treatment, I was terrified our relationship was going to be like Nina&#39;s... I went to his office at The Fort, I raised the sound barrier, closed the door and dropped to my knees BEGGING for his forgiveness in tears. I had NEVER begged to anyone for anything ever! He stood up and he picked me up in his strong arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No mi niña! Izzy, what you did... I know it was me who didn&#39;t leave you with another option. Of all of my children, you are the most difficult to predict, I always underestimate you and just when I think I have you figured out you change the rules of the game and I feel like I have to start from scratch. You have never disappointed me, you have always done your duty to the pack without any push back or complain... Nina, is Nina... I fear for her sometimes, but this was my mistake, you never ask for anything. Even the Lady Moira told me of your small request for your birthday... You are so strong! You&#39;re so much like your mother. I can&#39;t give you unicorns mija, I can&#39;t even give you forgiveness because it&#39;s me who should ask it of you. Do you forgive this foolish old man princesa?&#34; I wrapped my arms around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you Daddy!&#34; Hugging him tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa careful! I&#39;m afraid of you now!&#34; He said making me giggle... If Nina wouldn&#39;t have been so absorbed in just what she wanted, she would have been able to see what a great father Dad was. But I know he shares blame too... HE was the adult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We start walking downtown... &#34;So Tony, which do you consider to be the BEST place to get a good French dinner in Atabex City?&#34; I ask him. I know I put him in a difficult place. But he&#39;s going to have to get around to learning the bits and ends of our family dynamic, and he&#39;s already in a difficult place, he&#39;s Nina&#39;s mate for Goddesses sake!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ummm, well...&#34; I can already smell his sweat! Delicious! I love the smell of fear!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I heard from a friend in training that Le Nouveau Lieu was the best one over there.&#34; Freya chimes in. Ha!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NO--&#34; I turn around to face Nina and give her an innocent look and raise my arm to point at myself and said very sweetly...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Birthday!&#34; She bit her lips and stomped her foot in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice!&#34; Ura adds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;FINE! How do we get there? It&#39;s over an hour drive genius!&#34; I raise my finger asking for a moment. I really hope she&#39;s not busy with her new toy...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>L: &#39;Ayana?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A: &#39;Yo birthday girl I was hoping you would make contact, are there any unicorns in this place?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>L: &#39;Nope, and they wouldn&#39;t let our slutty hands touch them anymore anyways! We do have something else though. Do you think Hiroto would be up for racing?&#39; Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A: &#39;Are you shitting me?&#39;</p>

                <p>A: &#39;We&#39;re IN! Where are you?&#39;</p>

                <p>L: &#39;Waiting! Oh and tell Cressy to keep it secret, we&#39;re going to dinner first!&#39;</p>
