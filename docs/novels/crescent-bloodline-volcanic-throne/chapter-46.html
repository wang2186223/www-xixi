                <p>Kayden&#39;s POV:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very loud and persistent knocking on my door woke me from a very deep sleep. Daniella wasn&#39;t kidding when she promised dreamless deep sleep... it&#39;s not like she didn&#39;t do all that effort for nothing. The woman gave me two small bottles with liquids I&#39;ve never seen before, then made me strip down fully naked and submerged me in a healing bath including my head... to allow me to breath she placed a mask over my nose and mouth connected to a tube that was secured above the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My only instructions where to focus on clearing my mind from every single thought... It took me a while and my skepticism grew, yet I kept receiving reassurance through the water from the healer. I had never experienced anything like it before, I could hear her clearly through the water. I guess this is what Loiza meant when she said that healers were ruled by the element of water and some could even control it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We only have two doctors and I have never seen them use this technique, I can only imagine receiving this type of therapy every single time I am extremely stressed, and then I understood the great value The Osupa place on what we see as lower ranking wolves to the point of protecting them with their lives. It&#39;s like they had this secret that wasn&#39;t really a secret, they just respected the order of hierarchy in a pack, I have noticed that they treat those who we consider the lowest of the low, with great respect. And I absolutely understand it now... What fools we have been! Why have we never known this knowledge before, which came so naturally to The Osupa? I must have fallen asleep in the water dried and placed in my bed because I have no memory after more minutes of soothing words from Daniella and now waking still naked, which also makes me understand why nudity is not a taboo among them...the more I learn about their ways, the more I understand their strength and why The Council sees them as a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And right now I feel extremely relaxed and rested, I can only Imagine what a better pack we would be if instead of using our Omegas as servants, that they received the proper training of their true nature to help quicken the healing of Warriors in battle so they can go back to the fighting or helping those with PTSD or other mental ailments. And Marcus came to mind, I have to go check on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m awake! Give me a fucking minute!&#34; What NOW?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put some jeans and v-neck black shirt... at the door is Loiza&#39;s brother and Beta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Glad you&#39;re awake Alpha, I trust you are well rested?&#34; I swear that her brothers get great satisfaction from waking me up, they KNOW that I desperately want their sister with me and are using that as a powerful shield. If it would have been any other woman I would have ended them without caring if they were her brothers, but the moment I saw her power I knew that if any harm came not just to her family, but to her people, she could end ME HERSELF. It made me want her more... None of the other women I had fucked had the ability to make me want, love AND fear at the same time. They were weak idiots and I the biggest idiot for fucking them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well rested Beta, to what do I owe such a pleasant visit?&#34; And he just barges in my room without being invited in... Asshole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Glad you asked Alpha, I am here to inform that we had a change of plans.&#34; Is he fucking going to give me another excuse to not talk with my mate?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m listening...&#34; I&#39;m not going to let my dear brother in law get under my skin again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My sister&#39;s wolf is loosing control and it&#39;s affecting her own self control. Loiza needs a calm mind for tonight&#39;s ceremony, not only as Alpha, but as her duties of assisting Yaya as a Priestess of our people. So instead of meeting her after the ceremony I have assessed it would be more productive to meet her before, agreed?&#34; Well that one was unexpected...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At what time? I know of a place where we can be undisturbed and return her at whatever time you require.&#34; His eyes showed nothing but suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She must return an hour after sunset for the ceremony. I don&#39;t know what time that is here at this time of year, where we&#39;re from the sun usually sets at the same time all year round except for maybe a half an hour window in winter. So the time for you to return her is your responsibility. Right now she is verifying that everything for the ceremony is in order, so you are absolutely free to find her and set the time yourself like the big boy you are. However, I am warning you Alpha Kayden, there will be no mating ceremony today, so I suggest you keep restraining yourself as much as possible. My sister is dealing with many situations that other leaders older, and with more experienced than her, would have already buckled under all the pressure. She doesn&#39;t need you to make it harder for her, in any case if we are doing this is to alleviate her burden and set her mind at ease, and since you are her mate you are the most adequate to see to it that she is ready for this ceremony, which is crucial for the healing of our people, her role in the pack and standing with the Goddess. Do you understand?&#34; I have seen how seriously they take their traditions, if I mess this up I will not only be detested by her people and family (which I have noticed are very close) but she might be angry at me and reject me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand perfectly Beta, I will make sure that her mood is improved and that she is back to engage in her duties on time. You have my word that I will be in control over myself and help her as much as she needs from me.&#34; It&#39;s like walking over damn eggshells with him! But as long as I get to finally have time with Loiza it&#39;s more than worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good to have that be crystal clear Alpha, because with over 1,300 dead and over 200 missing and over 300 recovered bodies, this ceremony is the first step for our people to heal. She is in a clearing in the South West side of your territory verifying the progress of the drums. You may go to her right now and interrupt her, the Lady Yaya will overlook the final preparations.&#34; The moment he was saying to go to her now I was already looking for my boots and putting them on... but the casualties he mentioned is still on the back of my mind... I REALLY have to approach this as delicately as possible, the experiences that they have already had within my own pack are embarrassing enough without even mentioning the fact that those casualties are are directly correlated to my parent&#39;s stupidity. And now I think it&#39;s better I tell her AFTER the ceremony. The point of us meeting now is to clear her mind so she can be calm for her people, but it will be to her only that I give this information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Beta I&#39;m on it at once! Anything else you wish to add?&#34; I can&#39;t wait to look into her eyes, to listen to her voice, admire her body... and I start getting aroused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, keep it in your pants Alpha, she is Alpha to a mourning pack, it will happen but not yet.&#34; And he turns and leaves... maybe I should jerk off before going to her, my dick is rock solid just thinking those thoughts. So I take it out and it&#39;s so hard that it slaps my stomach, and I proceed to stroking myself thinking of being inside her, pounding her, eating her up... I could feel my cock pulsing for release, I could feel the build up in my balls and abdomen until finally I came with growl. I lay panting for a moment while I caught my bearings, but the thought of finally having a word alone with her was motivation enough to get me to the bathroom to take a quick shower and get a fresh pair of jeans and another V-shirt. And off I went following her scent of pineapples and vanilla.</p>
