                <p>The weight of the crown had never felt heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana had always understood responsibility. She had learned, in the years since being torn from her quiet life, that power was never truly hers-it was borrowed, demanded, earned. And now, it was split between two things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The empire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Seraphina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her daughter, her greatest creation, and the one thing she had never truly prepared herself for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nobles had begun their shift, their acceptance of Seraphina as heir settling into place with the weight of Tharx&#39;s decree. But Aeliana knew it wasn&#39;t as simple as loyalty and laws. There were those who would always question, who would always whisper, who would always wonder if the empire should have been left to someone purer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she had no time to address them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Seraphina needed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so did the empire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she did not know how to be both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first few weeks after the birth had been spent in survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caring for Seraphina was exhausting. The sleepless nights, the constant waking, the way her body still ached from childbirth-it took everything from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, the empire did not stop moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were treaties to review, trade agreements that needed her signature, foreign emissaries waiting for an audience. There were court politics that had to be maneuvered, war councils still debating how best to handle the few remaining rebellions on the outer planets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the people-they had expectations now. They wanted a queen who could stand beside her emperor, strong and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But all Aeliana felt was tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never been weak, never allowed herself to be. But there was a difference between being strong and being endless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she was starting to run out of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One night, she sat in the nursery, rocking Seraphina in her arms. The child&#39;s breathing was soft and steady, her tiny fingers curled against Aeliana&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Aeliana&#39;s mind was not at rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could still hear the court&#39;s murmurs, still see the way some of the nobles had hesitated before kneeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would it ever be enough? Would she ever be enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was failing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Failing as a queen, failing as a mother, failing to find the balance that no one had ever taught her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she had no idea how to fix it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had survived war. She had survived capture, rebellion, threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was something else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw the way she rubbed her temples at council meetings, the way she fought to keep her eyes open when reading through reports late into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw the way she was beginning to retreat into herself, shutting him out, burying herself in her duties as if forcing herself to function would solve everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he hated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he knew her better than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Aeliana was not easy to confront.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was stubborn, and she carried her burdens like armor, like a shield meant to keep the world at bay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched, he waited-but she did not come to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it infuriated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One night, he found her in the war chamber, hunched over a table, exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seraphina had finally settled after a particularly difficult night-one that had left Aeliana drained, her limbs heavy, her mind fogged with fatigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, instead of resting, she had come here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had sat beneath the flickering glow of the candles, staring at the latest reports, forcing herself to read them, forcing herself to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx did not announce his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did not need to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana knew the exact moment he entered the room, but she did not look up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, neither of them spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are running yourself into the ground,&#34; Tharx said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana exhaled, rubbing her forehead. &#34;I am fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strode toward her, his movements unhurried but deliberate. &#34;You are not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have work to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snatched the parchment from the table before she could stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally looked up, glaring. &#34;Tharx.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His golden eyes held no amusement. &#34;You are trying to fight a war that does not exist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stiffened. &#34;I am trying to ensure that Seraphina has an empire to rule one day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;Seraphina will have an empire because I will ensure it. You do not have to do everything, Aeliana.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because that was the heart of it, wasn&#39;t it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because if she didn&#39;t, then who was she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was supposed to be a queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An empress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, all she felt was torn between the two halves of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was quieter when she spoke next. More fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not know how to be both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx was silent for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, finally, he moved closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, tilted her chin up so she could not look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then he said, voice low and absolute-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are already both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you are already better than anyone before you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana let out a shaky breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he meant it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just something he was saying to soothe her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he had never seen her as weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never seen her as lesser for struggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was Aeliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she would never be anything less than formidable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Tharx did not let her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he guided her back to their chambers, his touch firm but not forceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He helped her remove the heavy robes of the day, helped her settle beneath the furs, helped her breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he held her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because she was weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But because she did not have to be strong alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana rested her head against his chest, listening to the steady beat of his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still did not have all the answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still did not know how to balance the weight of the crown with the weight of motherhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she would learn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would fight for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would make a place for herself that was more than just expectations and duty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would shape her own path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she would do it with Tharx beside her.</p>
