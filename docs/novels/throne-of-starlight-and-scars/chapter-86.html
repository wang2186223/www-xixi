                <p>The whispers had never truly stopped. They had merely become quieter, more insidious, woven into the fabric of the court like a hidden thread of poison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana had heard them in the corridors, in the veiled politeness of the nobles, in the careful phrasing of their well-wishes. Congratulations always sounded hollow when paired with hesitation, with uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A half-human heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a question none of them dared ask outright, but she could feel it lingering in every bow, in every glance cast toward her stomach when they thought she wasn&#39;t looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Will the child be strong enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Will they be like their mother? Like a human?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if they are unfit to rule?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana had spent months earning her place here, fighting for respect, forcing them to see her not as a foreigner but as their queen. And yet, with a single revelation, it was as if she had been reduced to nothing more than a womb carrying a question mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fists beneath the heavy sleeves of her gown as she moved through the palace halls, her every step measured, controlled, unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would not see her falter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she passed a group of nobles in hushed conversation, their words just barely carrying through the air, she almost stopped in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps the emperor should consider alternative options.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If a stronger heir could be secured...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He could always take another mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood in her veins ran hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana turned sharply, her voice a blade against the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak freely,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nobles froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them, an older lord with sharp cheekbones and eyes that reminded her of a serpent, had the audacity to lift his chin, feigning innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty,&#34; he murmured, offering a flawless bow, but there was no true respect in the gesture. &#34;We were merely speaking of the future of the empire. A ruler must always consider all possibilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana stared at him. &#34;And what possibilities are those?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of hesitation crossed his face, but he recovered quickly. &#34;Only that the emperor has a duty to ensure the strength of his bloodline.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers curled at her sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strength of his bloodline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could kill him for that alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she smiled-a slow, calculated smile. &#34;And you believe that the heir I carry does not meet that standard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tense pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the younger nobles shifted uncomfortably, suddenly realizing the danger of this conversation. But the older lord held her gaze, unrepentant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is not for me to decide,&#34; he said smoothly. &#34;Only time will tell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana exhaled slowly, forcing herself to remain still, to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could have struck him down here and now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this was not a battle to be fought in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was something Tharx needed to address in the open, in front of the court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Aeliana would make sure of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, tilting her head. &#34;Indeed. Time will tell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned and walked away, her steps silent but certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow, there would be a reckoning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The court was full when Tharx entered the grand hall the next day, his long strides measured, effortless, absolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana stood beside him, her face unreadable, her presence a quiet storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nobles had gathered like carrion birds, waiting to see what would happen, waiting to measure the emperor&#39;s response to the doubts they dared whisper behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx did not sit upon the throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he walked to the center of the room, his golden gaze sweeping over them like a slow, deliberate burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let the silence drag out, thick and suffocating, until not a single soul dared breathe too loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, finally-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear there are questions about the strength of my heir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one dared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s lips curled, but it was not a smile. It was something sharper, colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wonder if my child will be fit to rule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, no one moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana watched the nobles carefully, reading their expressions, the way some of them tried to remain impassive, while others had the sense to look afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx exhaled slowly. Then, with the quiet finality of a war drum before battle, he said-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My child will be strong-not because of what they are, but because of who they are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple moved through the court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx took another step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My heir will not be measured by the blood that runs through their veins. They will be measured by their will, by their strength, by what they become.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of his words settled over the nobles like iron shackles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let them absorb it before he continued, his voice deceptively soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And let me make something very clear-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his chin slightly, his expression carved from stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If anyone-anyone-suggests otherwise, they will not live to see the day my child takes the throne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana swore she saw one of the younger nobles go pale, his throat working as he swallowed thickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx shifted his gaze across the room, his golden eyes locking on the lord from the night before-the one who had suggested alternative options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The older man met his gaze with forced composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx let the silence stretch, let the tension wrap around them like a noose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kneel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A murmur of shock rippled through the court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noble&#39;s lips parted slightly, as if he might argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx did not give him the chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kneel,&#34; he repeated, his voice like a death sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noble&#39;s jaw tightened. He hesitated for a heartbeat too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s fingers twitched at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana knew that if the man did not kneel now, he would not leave this hall alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat of silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-the noble fell to his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx watched him with something like quiet amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you should,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana saw the way the court shifted after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saw the way the nobles looked at Tharx-not just as an emperor, not just as a warlord.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as a ruler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ruler who would not bend, would not be swayed, would not allow weakness in his rule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she saw something else, too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just fear of Tharx, but fear of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she was not a passive queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not a silent bystander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been the one to tell him about the whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, they all knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew that their doubts had reached the emperor&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And they knew who had put them there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana stood beside Tharx as he turned to leave, as the court bowed low before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before they exited the hall, Tharx leaned down-just slightly, just enough for only her to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see now,&#34; he murmured, his voice almost thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana lifted her chin. &#34;See what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s lips barely moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happens when they question what is mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s breath hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her gaze forward, hiding the small, slow smile that crept onto her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never feared the court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after today-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The court feared her.</p>
