                <p>The council chamber was a cacophony of raised voices, tension hanging thick in the air. Tharx stood at the head of the table, his fists clenched and his glowing eyes sharp as he glared at the assembled advisors. His patience, already thin, was at its breaking point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; he barked, his voice slicing through the room like a blade. The chamber fell silent, every advisor turning to face their king, though unease rippled among them. Tharx&#39;s rage was unmistakable, a storm barely contained beneath the surface of his controlled demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Draxis has taken Aeliana,&#34; Tharx continued, his voice low and cold, &#34;and I will not stand by while he uses her as leverage against this empire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An older advisor, Kadrin, stepped forward, his expression grim but defiant. &#34;My king, while this is... unfortunate, we must consider the greater implications. Mobilizing our forces to rescue a single human-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is not just a human,&#34; Tharx interrupted, his voice a growl. &#34;She is a hostage in the hands of a traitor. Allowing Draxis to wield her against me would set a precedent that this empire cannot afford.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another advisor, a younger noble, raised his voice cautiously. &#34;But if we divert resources to pursue her, we leave ourselves vulnerable to further attacks. Draxis&#39;s forces are still mobilizing. What if this is merely a trap?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s jaw tightened. His gaze swept over the council, his patience nearly exhausted. &#34;Draxis has made his intentions clear. He seeks to undermine me at every turn, to fracture this empire by sowing chaos and doubt. I will not let him succeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kadrin&#39;s frown deepened. &#34;And yet, my lord, your decision to risk everything for a single captive only feeds the perception of weakness. The people are watching, as are your enemies. What message does this send?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s glowing eyes locked on Kadrin, his anger simmering. &#34;It sends the message that this king will not tolerate threats against what is mine. And make no mistake-Aeliana is under my protection, whether this council deems her worthy or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chamber erupted again, advisors arguing among themselves, their loyalty to Tharx wavering under the weight of his decision. He ignored their noise, turning to one of his most trusted commanders, General Veylan, who stood silent but attentive near the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mobilize the personal guard,&#34; Tharx ordered, his voice cutting through the din. &#34;I will lead the mission myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stunned silence fell over the room. The council stared at him in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My king,&#34; Kadrin began, his tone incredulous, &#34;surely you do not mean to risk your own life for-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do,&#34; Tharx said firmly. &#34;Draxis believes he can challenge me by taking what is mine. I will show him the error of his ways.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock in the room was palpable. For Tharx, a king known for his calculated and ruthless decisions, to take such a personal risk was unthinkable. Whispers spread among the advisors, the tension escalating as speculation about his motivations grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not misunderstand,&#34; Tharx continued, his voice cold and steady. &#34;This is not a concession to weakness. It is a demonstration of strength. Draxis&#39;s actions will not go unanswered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>General Veylan nodded, his expression solemn. &#34;I will see to the preparations, my king.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Veylan departed, Tharx turned his back on the council, his dismissal of their objections clear. The murmurs behind him grew louder, but he paid them no heed. There was no room for debate. His decision had been made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the quiet of his chambers, Tharx prepared for the mission, the weight of his decision pressing down on him. His armor lay before him, gleaming in the dim light, a stark reminder of the battles he had fought and the burdens he carried. As he strapped on each piece, his thoughts turned to Aeliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had told himself that distancing her was for her own protection, that keeping her confined and away from the dangers of his world was the only way to keep her safe. But now, with her life in the hands of his greatest enemy, he saw the futility of his actions. His attempts to shield her had only made her a greater target, and his coldness had driven a wedge between them that now felt insurmountable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s mind replayed their last conversation, her words cutting through his defenses like a blade. &#34;You care more about your pride than about me.&#34; He had tried to dismiss her accusations, to convince himself that his decisions were rooted in logic, not fear. But as he prepared to risk everything to save her, he couldn&#39;t ignore the truth any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She mattered to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than he had wanted to admit, more than he had allowed himself to feel. And that realization, sharp and undeniable, left him feeling both resolute and exposed. Aeliana had become more than just a responsibility, more than a captive thrust into his world by circumstance. She was a part of him now, a part he could not afford to lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fortress buzzed with activity as Tharx&#39;s personal guard assembled, their armor gleaming and weapons ready. The soldiers moved with quiet efficiency, their loyalty to the king evident in every motion. They knew the stakes of this mission, and none dared question Tharx&#39;s decision to lead them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Tharx approached the courtyard, General Veylan stepped forward to meet him. &#34;The troops are ready, my king. We have a clear route to Draxis&#39;s stronghold, but the terrain will be difficult, and his forces are well-positioned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am aware,&#34; Tharx replied, his voice steady. &#34;But Draxis has underestimated me. He believes he holds the advantage, but his arrogance will be his undoing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Veylan hesitated for a moment before speaking again. &#34;With respect, my king, this mission is a risk we cannot afford to fail. The council already questions your actions. If anything happens to you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it will be their task to hold this empire together,&#34; Tharx said, his tone final. &#34;But I do not intend to fail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s face lingered in his mind as he mounted his war beast, the reins tight in his hands as the creature shifted beneath him. He could still see her expression the last time they had spoken-her anger, her pain, and the faint flicker of hope that he had extinguished with his cold words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had tried to protect her by keeping her at a distance, but now he saw the cost of that choice. He had failed her. And now, as the storm of war gathered on the horizon, he knew he had only one chance to make it right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the gates of the fortress opened, Tharx raised his hand, signaling his troops to move forward. The mission ahead was fraught with danger, but his resolve was unshakable. Draxis had made a mistake-a fatal one-and Tharx intended to make him pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this time, he would not stop until Aeliana was safe. No matter the cost.</p>
