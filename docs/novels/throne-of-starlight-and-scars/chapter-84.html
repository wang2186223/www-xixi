                <p>The war chamber was alive with voices, deep and sharp, cutting through the thick air like blades. The generals stood around the massive obsidian table, their armor gleaming under the dim candlelight, their eyes fixed on the intricate maps and battle plans laid out before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx sat at the head of it all, his presence commanding, unshaken as he listened to reports from his highest-ranking officers. The empire had never known true peace, and his rule had always been one of dominance, of unrelenting force, but now? Now, the stakes were different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t just securing his reign. They were securing his family&#39;s future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana sat in her usual seat beside him, but today, she felt more like a spectator than an equal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had watched him prepare for war before. She had seen him orchestrate battles, sieges, the crushing of rebellions. But this was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t about conquering new territories or putting down uprisings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was about defending her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx had left nothing to chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Security around the palace had tripled. Guards stationed at every entrance, every corridor. His most trusted warriors watched over her even when she slept. He planned for assassination attempts, poisonings, kidnappings-every possible threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana listened as one of the commanders detailed the new security measures surrounding the city&#39;s borders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The patrols have been increased. No one gets in or out without being thoroughly inspected. The main gates are sealed at nightfall, and all trade routes are under watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not enough,&#34; Tharx said smoothly, his voice like steel. &#34;Expand the perimeter. I want eyes in every outpost, every village near the capital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The general bowed his head, making a note on the parchment before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana exhaled, a slow frustration building in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every conversation was the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every meeting about threats, about security, about how best to ensure that no one could get close enough to harm her or the child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, in all of these discussions, she was a bystander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They spoke about her, around her-but never to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because in Tharx&#39;s mind, this was not her battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fists beneath the table, fighting the urge to stand and leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she forced herself to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could not take part in the planning, then she would at least understand it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the meeting continued, as Tharx laid out his next strategy, something within her tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never been a warrior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was clever. Practical. She had learned how to navigate power, how to survive among those who wanted her dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in this room, surrounded by men who spoke of war as easily as breathing, she felt something she had not expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had fought for her place at Tharx&#39;s side, had carved it out with blood and defiance, with careful words and unwavering resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she was a queen with no sword to wield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting lasted for hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time it ended, Aeliana felt as drained as if she had fought a battle herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The generals left one by one, offering their bows to Tharx before disappearing into the long corridors of the palace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when they were alone did Tharx finally turn to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His golden eyes swept over her carefully, as if assessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re angry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana let out a sharp laugh, shaking her head. &#34;Am I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx studied her for a long moment, then leaned back in his chair. &#34;Say what&#39;s on your mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, finally-&#34;Where do I fit into all of this, Tharx?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows furrowed slightly. &#34;You fit exactly where you are now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed, pushing herself up from her chair. &#34;Sitting silently while you prepare for war?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx sighed, running a hand over his jaw. &#34;You are not-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not a warrior,&#34; she cut in, her voice sharp. &#34;I know that. I do not wield a sword, I do not command armies. But that does not mean I should sit here, waiting for you to decide what happens to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s eyes darkened. &#34;What happens to you is not up for discussion. It is my responsibility to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she snapped, stepping closer. &#34;It is your responsibility to rule. And it is mine, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tensed, but he said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana exhaled slowly, trying to steady herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not sit idle, Tharx.&#34; She lowered her voice, but the fire in it remained. &#34;You may prepare for war, but that is not my way. I will help our people, I will shape this empire in my own way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, he did not speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, finally, his lips curled into something almost amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are relentless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana arched a brow. &#34;And you only realized this now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx let out a low breath, standing to his full height. &#34;Fine. Do what you must.&#34; He stepped closer, his fingers tilting her chin up, forcing her to meet his gaze. &#34;But do not think for a moment that I will stop watching over you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana smirked. &#34;I would never expect otherwise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left him there, in the war chamber, already knowing where she would begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never belonged in war councils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she knew how to rule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her attention to the people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of battle plans, she spent her days meeting with advisors, speaking to merchants, listening to the concerns of the city&#39;s workers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked through the capital-in disguise, as she had done before. She sat among the commoners, heard their worries not as a queen, but as one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with every conversation, she began shaping the empire in her own way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the nobles still saw her as an outsider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their smiles were polite, their words carefully measured. They bowed, but not out of true loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And behind closed doors, they whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should she even be concerning herself with empire affairs in her condition?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A queen should focus on producing heirs, not ruling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She meddles too much. This is not her place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had expected it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But knowing it did not make it easier to swallow the bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One evening, she returned to the palace feeling exhausted, but satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent the day arranging new trade agreements, ensuring that the merchant guilds were strengthened under her rule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not war, but it was power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found Tharx waiting for her in their chambers, arms crossed as he leaned against the balcony railing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned as she entered, his golden eyes sharp, assessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You smell like the city,&#34; he remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana smirked. &#34;I was in the city.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied her. &#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer. &#34;And I&#39;m learning. The people trust me, Tharx.&#34; She tilted her head. &#34;More than they trust your nobles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a low hum. &#34;That does not surprise me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a slow breath, her gaze steady. &#34;You rule through force. Through conquest. And it has made you powerful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx arched a brow. &#34;And you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s lips curled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will rule through loyalty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something flickered in his expression-something like approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed away from the railing, closing the space between them. His fingers traced down her arm, settling against her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are learning how to rule,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled, leaning into his touch. &#34;I am learning how to survive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s golden eyes burned into hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are learning how to win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in weeks, she felt like she belonged.</p>
