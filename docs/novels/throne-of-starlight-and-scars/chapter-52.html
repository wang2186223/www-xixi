                <p>The empire was breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The division had always been there, hiding beneath layers of civility and political maneuvering, but now, it was open, undeniable. The court no longer pretended at unity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana could see it in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who had always backed Tharx-nobles like Lord Verath and the warlords who had built their power alongside his-remained steady, but their numbers were thinning. Kaelrith and Veraxia&#39;s faction had grown bolder, their whispers turning into action, their hidden plans slipping into the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first signs had been subtle. A shift in the balance of trade routes. Military garrisons moving under the guise of routine inspections. A steady but quiet consolidation of power outside the capital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it was no longer subtle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were gathering forces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Preparing for something inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then came his decree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any attack on Aeliana is an attack on the throne.&#34;</p>

                <p>Aeliana had spent enough time in the court to know what it meant. The moment Tharx had spoken those words, he had drawn a line in the sand, forcing every noble, every general, every hidden conspirator to make a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message had been heard far beyond the palace walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was no longer just a concubine. No longer just a political piece to be maneuvered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not yet named his queen, not yet granted a formal title-but this? This was as close as he had ever come to saying it outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was what made her dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grand council chamber was thick with tension, the air humming with the weight of unspoken defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana stood behind Tharx&#39;s chair, her presence deliberate. She was not meant to be here-not officially. But she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And they all saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaelrith sat near the far end of the obsidian table, his expression composed, unreadable. Veraxia, ever poised, sat beside him, her golden rings catching the candlelight as she idly traced the rim of her goblet. They were not the only ones watching. Others, once neutral, now leaned ever so slightly in their direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The divide was visible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lord Verath, ever loyal, broke the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The rumors are confirmed,&#34; he said evenly, his fingers steepled before him. &#34;Troop movements along the eastern borders. Unusual deployments under the banner of routine patrols. They are consolidating power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words should have sparked outrage, but they did not. No one even feigned surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because they all knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only question left was when.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s fingers drummed lightly against the table, the slow, measured sound like the ticking of an unseen clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many?&#34; he asked, his voice calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verath hesitated. &#34;Enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, finally, Kaelrith spoke. &#34;It is only natural for lords to strengthen their defenses,&#34; he said, his tone smooth, unbothered. &#34;The empire is in a delicate state, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delicate,&#34; Aeliana echoed softly, her gaze locking onto him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaelrith&#39;s lips curled into the faintest smile. &#34;Surely you agree, Lady Aeliana.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not look away. &#34;I think,&#34; she said evenly, &#34;that men do not gather armies unless they plan to use them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the air like a blade suspended in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaelrith did not rise to it. He only smiled again, tilting his goblet slightly before taking a slow sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana shifted her attention to Veraxia. Unlike Kaelrith, Veraxia did not play at pretense. She met Aeliana&#39;s gaze directly, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana spoke again, this time not to them, but to the entire room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They don&#39;t fear you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not a question. It was a statement of fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension sharpened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are moving openly because they still believe they can win,&#34; she continued. &#34;They believe your allies are too few. That the weight of tradition is on their side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the words settle, let them sink beneath the polished exterior of political civility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx had ruled with an iron hand for years. He had crushed rebellions, executed traitors, expanded the empire&#39;s reach further than any before him. But power alone was not enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been necessary to the court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were counting the days until they could remove him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s fingers finally stilled against the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it is time,&#34; he said quietly, &#34;to remind them why I wear this crown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting ended soon after. No open threats. No grand proclamations. Just the quiet certainty of war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was still when Aeliana returned to her chambers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still-but not peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had felt it the moment she stepped through the doors. A shift in the air, a presence that had been here and was now gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed the note before she reached it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was left just inside the door, folded with precise, deliberate care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked it up, unfolding it slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave while you still can. He will not be able to save you when the time comes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath slowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not a demand. Not a threat of violence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She read the words again, her fingers tightening around the parchment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind worked through the implications. This was not a message from an assassin, not from someone who wanted her dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No-this was something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps even from someone within Tharx&#39;s own circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse hammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew what this meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coup was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she might not survive it.</p>
