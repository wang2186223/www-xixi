                <p>Pain and exhaustion clung to Aeliana like a second skin. She had always prided herself on her resilience, on her ability to endure. But this-this was unlike anything she had ever faced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The recovery from childbirth was slow, painfully slow, and her body no longer felt like her own. Every movement was an effort, every muscle ached in ways she had never known possible. She had faced war, she had fought battles she never should have won, but now even something as simple as sitting up in bed sent sharp aches through her abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than the exhaustion, more than the soreness, she hated feeling weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, Tharx hovered over her like a watchful sentinel, never straying far, always ensuring that she was comfortable, that she had enough to eat, that the royal physician checked on her at regular intervals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do not have to keep fussing over me,&#34; she murmured one evening, as Tharx gently adjusted the pillows behind her back, his golden eyes scanning her for any sign of discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are still healing,&#34; he replied, his voice calm but unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gave birth, Tharx. I did not fall in battle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stilled, his gaze flicking to hers, unreadable. Then, slowly, he exhaled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is the same to me,&#34; he admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana blinked. She hadn&#39;t expected that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was no teasing in his voice, no jest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen fear in his eyes the night Seraphina was born. Fear that he had never shown before, not in war, not in the face of an enemy, not even when his own life had been in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he had seen her in pain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had been different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me take care of you,&#34; he murmured, his fingers brushing against hers, warm and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never been good at allowing herself to be vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for **this moment, just this once-**she let him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nights were the hardest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seraphina had a voice for a child so small. A voice that filled their chambers at all hours, demanding attention, demanding comfort, demanding things neither of them fully understood yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana refused to let anyone else tend to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The palace was filled with servants and attendants who would gladly take the child into their care, but Aeliana would not allow it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one else will raise my daughter,&#34; she had said sharply when one of the nurses had timidly suggested it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx had not argued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything, he had looked proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that did not change the fact that Aeliana was exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seraphina slept in short intervals, waking every hour, crying until Aeliana rocked her back to sleep, until she was fed, until she was soothed by the familiar warmth of her mother&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some nights, Aeliana barely slept at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, she refused to give in to the fatigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aeliana, sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will. When she does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She will wake again soon. You need to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am fine, Tharx.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she would not admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had survived battles, she had survived being taken from her home, thrown into a world she did not understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could survive this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx, however, was relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One night, she awoke to the absence of Seraphina&#39;s cries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, panic seized her, her mind snapping to alertness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing near the hearth, Seraphina cradled carefully in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The firelight cast long shadows against the walls, painting his sharp features in soft golds and deep ambers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana watched, stunned, silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did not see her stir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did not know she was watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so, he did not guard his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His golden eyes, so often filled with fire, with command, with the weight of his rule, were something else entirely as he looked down at their daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something softer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are louder than a battle cry, little one,&#34; he murmured, his voice so low, so unguarded, that Aeliana felt something tighten in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seraphina stirred in his arms, a soft whimper escaping her small lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx shifted, adjusting his hold with a carefulness Aeliana had never seen from him before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will not remember these nights,&#34; he continued, voice barely above a whisper. &#34;But I will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana felt something inexplicable knot in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have waged wars,&#34; Tharx murmured, his gaze never leaving Seraphina&#39;s small face. &#34;I have destroyed those who stood in my way. I have conquered, commanded, ruled without question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers brushed against the curve of her tiny cheek, so gentle it made Aeliana&#39;s breath catch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I have never known this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana closed her eyes for a moment, swallowing against the emotion rising within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not the Tharx the world knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not the warlord, the emperor, the conqueror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a man who had been changed in ways he did not yet fully understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana shifted slightly, just enough for the movement to catch his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His golden eyes flicked to her, startled for only a fraction of a second before he masked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had seen it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen all of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, neither of them spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, finally-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be sleeping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana exhaled, a soft, tired smile pulling at her lips. &#34;So should you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx huffed, his grip on Seraphina unchanging, unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is loud,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is yours,&#34; Aeliana teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something flickered in his gaze. Something unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana felt the truth of it settle deep within her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seraphina was theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just a ruler&#39;s child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just an heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a piece of both of them, a part of something neither of them had ever dreamed of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana pushed herself up, wincing slightly as the soreness in her body protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx frowned immediately. &#34;Aeliana-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am fine,&#34; she said, reaching out, holding her arms open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, carefully, he placed their daughter into her waiting arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana inhaled softly, pressing a gentle kiss to Seraphina&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx watched them, his gaze soft, unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not what I expected,&#34; Aeliana murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx arched a brow. &#34;No?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; She looked up, meeting his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the warmth in his golden eyes was answer enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as Seraphina settled against her chest, safe and warm, Aeliana knew one thing for certain-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not just a new life for their daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a new life for all of them.</p>
