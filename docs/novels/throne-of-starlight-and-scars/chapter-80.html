                <p>The world shifted in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One moment, Aeliana was tangled with him in the sheets, her breath still unsteady, her skin flushed with warmth from their shared fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next-she was collapsing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx barely had time to catch her before she hit the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aeliana.&#34; His voice was sharp, the kind of command that could stop armies in their tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart slammed against his ribs, a brutal, unfamiliar panic clawing its way up his throat. He laid her down carefully on the bed, pressing his fingers against her wrist, feeling for a pulse that was too fast, too erratic. Her skin was warm-too warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t exhaustion. This wasn&#39;t something simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers moved to her cheek, tilting her face toward him. &#34;Aeliana,&#34; he murmured again, softer now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His vision narrowed, his blood roaring in his ears. No. No, this was not happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx moved before he could think. Yanking the door open with such force that the wood splintered in his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards outside the chamber snapped to attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get the physician,&#34; Tharx ordered, his voice a growl, dangerous and unshaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nearest guard hesitated. &#34;My lord-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx turned his gaze to him, and the man paled instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx slammed the door shut behind him, his breath ragged, his hands clenching into fists at his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still on the bed, her chest rising and falling too shallowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crossed the room, sitting beside her, his hand pressing against her stomach, her ribs-searching for wounds, for something he might have missed. But there was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No cuts. No bruises. No blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then she hadn&#39;t been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s jaw clenched so tightly it ached. He reached for her hand, lifting it between his own, pressing his lips against her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are stronger than this,&#34; he muttered, his voice rough, his thumb brushing along her skin. &#34;You will not leave me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t stir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door burst open behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The royal physician rushed in, his apprentice at his heels, both men looking half-afraid to be in the same room as the Emperor in this state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fix her.&#34; His voice was sharp, cold, lethal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The physician trembled as he approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, my lord.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The examination was agonizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx watched every movement, tracking the physician&#39;s hands as he checked her pulse, felt along her jaw, lifted her eyelids. The apprentice muttered something about checking for poisons, for traces of magic, for anything unnatural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx remained perfectly still. But the room itself felt like it was vibrating with the force of his rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, after long, torturous minutes, the physician swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is nothing, my lord.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s hands flexed, his breathing measured, forced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No poison,&#34; the physician continued quickly. &#34;No injury, no curse that I can detect. Her body is simply weakened. But I do not know why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx exhaled slowly, his fingers digging into his thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana was not weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was fire and fury and steel, a woman who had never yielded, never faltered, never broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, she lay there-motionless, vulnerable, slipping further away from him with every second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t accept that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The physician hesitated before speaking again. &#34;She needs rest, my lord. I will continue to monitor her condition-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx stood so suddenly the chair beneath him scraped against the stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The physician flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rest?&#34; Tharx&#39;s voice was dangerously soft. &#34;That is your answer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The physician&#39;s face went ashen. &#34;It is the only answer I have, my Emperor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx moved before he could stop himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The goblet on the bedside table flew across the chamber, smashing into the wall, metal and glass exploding upon impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The physician&#39;s apprentice yelped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The physician himself simply shut his eyes and waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx exhaled through his nose, slow and controlled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She does not wake,&#34; he said, voice like steel. &#34;And you tell me to be patient?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The physician bowed deeply, nearly folding himself in half. &#34;My Emperor, please. There is nothing more I can do at this moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after what felt like an eternity, Tharx turned away from him, his focus shifting back to Aeliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat down on the edge of the bed once more, taking her hand again, running his thumb over her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She stays in this room,&#34; he said. &#34;No one else comes near her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The physician nodded quickly. &#34;Yes, my lord.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Return when you have real answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men didn&#39;t waste a second. They were gone within moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door shut, and Tharx was left alone with his queen, still and silent in their bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, he did not go to court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did not eat. He did not sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendants came and went, but no one dared to speak unless spoken to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched into the afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vaelkor arrived just before sundown, standing stiffly at the doorway, his usual mask of calm betrayed by the tension in his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx barely glanced at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The court is restless,&#34; Vaelkor said carefully. &#34;The nobles will notice your absence soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can rot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vaelkor sighed. &#34;Tharx-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx finally looked at him, his golden eyes burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vaelkor fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Tharx turned back to Aeliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, brushing his fingers through her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She does not wake,&#34; he murmured. &#34;I will not leave her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vaelkor studied him for a long moment. Then, finally, he gave a slow nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will handle the court.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just watched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just waited.</p>
