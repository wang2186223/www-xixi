                <p>The candlelight flickered against the stone walls of their chambers, casting golden hues across the sprawling bed where Aeliana rested. The exhaustion of childbirth still weighed on her, a dull ache settled deep in her bones, but her mind was sharp, focused on the tiny bundle in her arms. The small, sleeping form of their daughter, swaddled in the softest silks the empire had to offer, her delicate breaths steady against Aeliana&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx sat beside them, his golden eyes unwavering as they rested on the infant&#39;s face. He had been watching her like this since the moment she was born, as if he still couldn&#39;t fully grasp that she was real, that she was theirs. His fingers twitched slightly, resting on the bed beside them, as though he was resisting the urge to reach for his daughter again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana lifted a tired gaze toward him. &#34;You can hold her, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s brows furrowed slightly, his expression unreadable. &#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smirk touched her lips. &#34;And yet, you stare at her like she&#39;s made of something more fragile than glass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His golden eyes flickered to hers, but there was no amusement in them. Instead, there was something deeper. Something Aeliana couldn&#39;t name. &#34;I have destroyed empires with my hands,&#34; he murmured, his voice rough, quiet. &#34;But this I do not know how to hold this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana exhaled softly, shifting the baby slightly so she could extend her free hand toward him. &#34;Come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx hesitated for only a moment before leaning in. Aeliana guided his hand carefully, placing his palm against their daughter&#39;s small chest. The warmth of his skin enveloped the child, and for the first time, he did not pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared down at her, his jaw tightening as his fingers curled slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana watched him. &#34;She needs a name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx didn&#39;t move, didn&#39;t take his gaze away from their child. &#34;She does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana swallowed, her voice softer now. &#34;Have you thought of one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx exhaled slowly. &#34;I have considered many.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head slightly. &#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally looked at her. &#34;None of them fit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana felt something warm settle in her chest. &#34;Then let&#39;s find one together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx nodded, his fingers still resting against the baby&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They spoke late into the night, murmuring names back and forth, testing each syllable as if it were the blade of a sword-measuring its weight, its strength. Tharx, ever the ruler, leaned toward names of power, of history, of command. Aeliana, ever the balance, sought something with meaning, something that would reflect not just their empire, but who their daughter would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then-they found it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A name that settled between them like something that had always belonged there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx whispered it first, his voice reverent, like it was a secret meant only for them. Aeliana repeated it, tasting the shape of it, feeling the way it fit perfectly against her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their daughter&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one else&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, the royal advisors and council members gathered, as expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did not take long for them to begin voicing their opinions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The name of the heir must reflect tradition,&#34; one of the elder nobles insisted, his voice firm, his hands clasped tightly together in what he no doubt believed to be a stance of wisdom and authority. &#34;A name tied to the great rulers before her. A name that will command respect the moment it is spoken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The empire has never had a ruler of mixed blood,&#34; another added, his tone carefully neutral, but Aeliana could hear the implication beneath it. &#34;This child&#39;s name must erase any doubts of her legitimacy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx sat at the head of the chamber, silent, unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana knew this stillness well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the kind of silence that preceded war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel it radiating from him, the tension coiling tighter and tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then-he finally spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The single word cut through the chamber like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nobles hesitated, their posturing faltering slightly. &#34;My Emperor-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every movement was deliberate, calculated. His golden eyes burned, but his voice was calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do not decide the name of my heir,&#34; he said simply. &#34;No one does-except us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana let her gaze sweep over them, watching the way some of the nobles stiffened, the way others carefully lowered their gazes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had never questioned Tharx before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not openly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she knew what they were thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They could not stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they could resent him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx stepped forward slowly, his presence suffocating in its intensity. &#34;If any of you believe otherwise, I welcome you to speak now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, the discussion was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grand hall was filled to its very edges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobles, warriors, high-ranking officials, and emissaries from every corner of the empire gathered beneath the towering pillars, all waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not just a naming ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment that would shape the empire&#39;s future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana stood beside Tharx, clothed in dark silks lined with gold. She felt the weight of the moment pressing against her, the silent expectation of the people, of the empire itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she looked to Tharx, she saw only certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warlord who had once ruled with nothing but fire and blood now held something far greater in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he did not hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted the child before the gathered court, his golden eyes shining beneath the torches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell over the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The empire held its breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, his voice rang out clear, unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the future of our empire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words settled into the stone, into the very air itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, finally-he spoke her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seraphina Velka Tharxian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A name that carried the weight of two worlds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A name that belonged to no one but her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A name that would be written in the stars of history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then-one by one, the nobles bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some did so without hesitation. Others with carefully hidden reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they all bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana let out a slow breath, her fingers brushing against Tharx&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that moment, she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter the whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter the shadows that still lurked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter the ones who would try to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their daughter was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was named.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the empire would never be the same again.</p>
