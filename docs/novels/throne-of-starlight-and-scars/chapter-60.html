                <p>The council chamber was quieter than it had ever been. The heavy stone walls, usually echoing with debate and argument, now held only silence. Thick, waiting silence. A silence that carried a weight beyond words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx sat at the head of the obsidian table, his presence commanding, his golden eyes cold as he surveyed the gathered nobles. Aeliana sat beside him, her own posture composed but alert, scanning the room for the smallest sign of unease, of hesitation, of guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The summons had been sent in the dead of night. No couriers, no formal calls-just Tharx&#39;s own enforcers delivering a simple message: Attend. Immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana had barely seen him sleep since the night she was nearly poisoned. His rage had been quiet, sharp-edged-so controlled it was almost calm, which made it all the more dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew what he was doing now. Smoke out the traitor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Lord Kaelrith sat stiffly, his fingers drumming against the wood. Lady Veraxia, always calculating, shifted her gaze between the gathered figures, watching, waiting. Other nobles sat in various states of unease. Some loyal, some terrified, some-perhaps-guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s voice, when he finally spoke, was ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know why you are here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze swept over them, slow, deliberate. No one dared speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The events of the past days have made one thing clear,&#34; he continued. &#34;The rebellion is not just at our gates. It is here, within these walls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana watched closely as some nobles flinched at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx leaned forward slightly, his tone almost conversational. &#34;There are those among you who have already chosen a side. Who believe I do not see their cowardice. Their betrayal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doors to the council chamber slammed open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s hand went to her dagger as armed soldiers flooded inside, their weapons drawn. The nobles gasped, pushing back from the table in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lord Varen stepped forward, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had hoped,&#34; he said, his voice steady, &#34;that you would see reason before it came to this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx did not move. He did not flinch. He simply stared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s fingers curled around the hilt of her blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Varen came closer, his soldiers flanking him on either side. &#34;The empire is crumbling, Tharx. The people suffer under your rule, and yet you refuse to listen. We tried to warn you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, humorless smile touched Tharx&#39;s lips. &#34;Warn me? Is that what you call assassinating my men? Poisoning my consort? You insult us both, Varen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Varen&#39;s expression remained impassive. &#34;You&#39;ve lost control. You hold this empire in an iron grip, but even iron can shatter. If you do not yield, it will break beneath you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s heart pounded, but she remained still, waiting, watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the nobles had begun to shift in their seats. Others had gone pale, realizing that this was no longer a political dispute. This was a coup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Varen&#39;s voice did not waver. &#34;Draxis is coming. And when he arrives, this war will end.&#34; He exhaled, as if choosing his next words carefully. &#34;I offer you this once-step down, Tharx. Leave the capital. Surrender Aeliana to Draxis, and your life will be spared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana felt her breath catch in her throat. Step down. Surrender her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, her gaze flicked toward Tharx.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression had not changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was frozen, waiting, the tension sharp as a drawn blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, dangerous sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled, shaking his head slightly, as if he had expected nothing less. And then, in a movement so fluid it was almost effortless, he stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t speak immediately. Instead, he tilted his head slightly, as if considering the weight of the offer Varen had just laid before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then-he unsheathed his sword.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The obsidian blade gleamed in the firelight, its edges honed to lethal perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will say this once, Varen,&#34; Tharx said, his voice smooth, unwavering. &#34;You and those who stand with you have already made your choice. There is no surrender. There is no peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana reached for her own dagger just as chaos erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the nobles cried out as a blade was drawn. Varen took a step back, but it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council chamber became a battleground in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soldiers lunged for Tharx, but he was faster-his blade slicing through the first attacker before they could react. Blood sprayed across the stone floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana barely had time to register the movement before she was fighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soldier lunged for her, but she twisted, driving her dagger into his ribs before he could strike. Another grabbed for her arm-she slammed her knee into his stomach, sending him sprawling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobles screamed, shoving away from the chaos. Some ran for the doors, others ducked beneath the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaelrith drew his own weapon, but hesitated-his loyalty wavering in real time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Varen was losing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx moved through the fight with brutal precision, cutting down anyone who came for him. Blood pooled at his feet. The clash of steel rang through the chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana barely dodged a strike aimed for her head. She pivoted, slicing her dagger across the attacker&#39;s throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana turned in time to see Varen stumble back, clutching a wound to his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx advanced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Varen&#39;s soldiers were either dead or retreating, their attempt at an ambush already falling apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Varen gritted his teeth, backing away toward the doors. &#34;This is not over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx took another step forward, blade poised to end him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could strike, Varen turned and ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last of his men followed, their footsteps echoing as they fled into the corridors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, only the sound of ragged breathing filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nobles who had remained stared in shock at the bloodshed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana wiped a splatter of blood from her cheek, chest rising and falling with adrenaline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx was still for a long moment, his blade dripping onto the stone floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned, meeting Aeliana&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was only the beginning,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Aeliana knew-the war for the empire had truly begun.</p>
