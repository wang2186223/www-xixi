                <p>The alien ship&#39;s descent onto the planet was eerily smooth, a silent transition through the atmosphere that left Aeliana feeling disoriented. There were no shuddering engines, no turbulence-just an overwhelming sense of dread as the alien landscape came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the small viewport of her cell, Aeliana could see Tharx&#39;s homeworld stretching out before her. The planet&#39;s surface was unlike anything she had ever imagined. Vast cities sprawled across the landscape, but they weren&#39;t like the cities of Earth. These cities were strange and otherworldly, made of organic materials that seemed to pulse with life. Buildings rose in jagged, asymmetrical towers, twisting and branching like giant, blackened trees made of stone and metal. Web-like structures connected them, and the ground below seemed to ripple with strange, dark veins that pulsed like blood vessels. It was as if the very planet itself was alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Above it all, the sky glowed a sickly green, thick with clouds that crackled with faint electrical storms. The sun-or whatever passed for one on this planet-hung low in the sky, casting everything in a harsh, unnatural light. The air, even inside the ship, felt heavier, denser, as if it pressed down on her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s throat tightened as she stared at the alien world. It was hostile and cold, and even without stepping foot on the surface, she could feel that this was not a place for humans. Whatever hope she had clung to of finding a way to survive here began to slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ship touched down without so much as a jolt, and Aeliana&#39;s stomach lurched as she realized she was about to leave the relative safety of the ship. She wasn&#39;t ready-how could anyone be ready for this? But the cold reality of her situation slammed into her like a wave. There was no going back. She was in their world now, and she belonged to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the door to her cell opened, she stiffened, half expecting Tharx himself to appear. But it was the same two soldiers who had been tasked with her since the beginning. Their glowing eyes regarded her with the same impassive expression as they motioned for her to follow. Aeliana stood slowly, her legs weak, her breath shallow. Her heart raced as she stepped out of the cell, the cold, metallic floor beneath her bare feet a stark reminder of her vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they led her through the ship, the walls seemed to pulse with a faint hum, as if the vessel itself was alive. Every inch of the ship felt foreign, but as they reached the landing ramp, Aeliana&#39;s attention was drawn to the sounds outside-the low hum of machinery, the crackle of strange energy, and the distant, unfamiliar noises of the alien world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ramp lowered, and the first thing that hit her was the air. It was thick and humid, heavier than she had anticipated, and with every breath she took, it felt like the atmosphere was trying to weigh her down. The world beyond was vast, stretching out into a horizon of jagged architecture and alien forms. She could barely see the sky through the massive buildings, their towering spires disappearing into the oppressive clouds above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soldiers didn&#39;t slow as they led her down the ramp and onto the alien soil. Aeliana hesitated for only a moment before following, her heart pounding. Her bare feet touched the ground-warm and rough beneath her-and she resisted the urge to recoil. It was almost like stepping on flesh, or something that shifted slightly beneath her toes, though it remained solid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they moved into the alien city, Aeliana&#39;s eyes darted around, trying to take in everything at once. The streets were wide, lined with what she assumed were some kind of market stalls or gathering places, though they looked nothing like the stalls back in Willow Glen. The structures around her pulsed with light, shifting colors between deep greens and purples, their surfaces covered in strange, organic textures that undulated in a way that made her stomach turn. The air was filled with the faint scent of something metallic and sharp, mingled with a scent she couldn&#39;t place-almost like something burning, but not quite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aliens filled the streets, their forms as varied as the structures around them. Some were tall and sleek like Tharx, while others were smaller, hunched, and strange, with limbs that twisted in unnatural ways. Their eyes followed her as she passed, unblinking and cold. Aeliana felt their gazes crawling over her skin, and she realized with a sickening feeling that she was not seen as a person here. She was something less-something insignificant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They brought her to Tharx&#39;s palace, if it could be called that. The structure loomed above the rest of the city, a massive, dark fortress of jagged stone and metal. The walls seemed to twist and pulse as if they were alive, and veins of glowing green energy ran through the surface like blood through skin. The entrance was grand, but cold-wide steps leading up to towering doors that opened without a sound as they approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the air was even heavier, and the temperature dropped sharply. Aeliana shivered as she followed the soldiers through the narrow corridors, the walls pressing in on her like the ribs of a great beast. The lights here were dim, casting long, eerie shadows that made her feel as though she were walking through a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, they brought her to a vast chamber at the heart of the fortress. It was dark, lit only by the faint glow of the walls themselves, and at the far end sat King Tharx.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was seated on his throne, high above the rest of the chamber, his eyes cold and distant as he watched her approach. His armor gleamed under the faint light, his form massive and imposing. Even without moving, he commanded the entire space with his presence, as though the very walls bent to his will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s stomach churned with fear as she was brought before him. The soldiers stepped back, leaving her standing alone in the middle of the chamber, the silence pressing down on her like a physical weight. She wanted to look away, to hide from his gaze, but she forced herself to stand tall, even though her legs felt weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome,&#34; Tharx said, his voice deep and resonant. It echoed through the chamber, sending a chill down her spine. &#34;You have arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana said nothing, unsure if she was even supposed to speak. She felt small and insignificant under his gaze, a mere insect in his world. He studied her for a long moment, his expression unreadable, before turning his attention to one of the soldiers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Prepare her quarters,&#34; Tharx commanded, his voice cold and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soldiers nodded and motioned for Aeliana to follow them, but before she could take a step, Tharx spoke again, his voice lower this time. &#34;You are mine now,&#34; he said, his eyes locking with hers. &#34;You will serve me, and in return, I will protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words made her stomach drop, but there was something about his tone-something strange. He wasn&#39;t cruel. Distant, yes. But not cruel. It was as though he were merely stating facts, laying out the terms of an arrangement she had no say in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s throat tightened. She wanted to fight, to protest, to scream that she didn&#39;t belong to anyone. But the words stuck in her throat, trapped beneath the fear and the knowledge that resistance would be futile. She had already been claimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soldiers led her away once again, this time to her new quarters. The room was small, but not uncomfortable-at least, not in the way she had expected. There was a bed, an alien thing made of strange, organic material that looked like it might pulse if she touched it, but it was soft. A low table sat in the corner, and a window gave her a view of the alien city below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But despite the relative comfort, the reality of her situation settled over her like a shroud. She wasn&#39;t free. She wasn&#39;t safe. She was a possession-nothing more than a thing for Tharx to own and use as he saw fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, as she sat on the edge of the bed, staring out at the city, she couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that there was something more to him. He was distant, cold, but not as brutal as she had imagined. There was something deeper in him-something she didn&#39;t understand yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But understanding wouldn&#39;t change the fact that she was trapped here, a world away from home, with no way back.</p>
