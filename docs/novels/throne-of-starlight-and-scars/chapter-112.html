                <p>The moment the assassin slipped from the banquet hall, Aeliana knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t see his face, but she saw his movement-the deliberate, precise way he disappeared into the shadows, a ghost among the palace staff. Her heart lurched in her chest. Her breath caught. Something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already moving before the realization had fully formed. Her goblet crashed to the table, wine spilling across the pristine white tablecloth, a scarlet stain spreading like blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seraphina,&#34; she breathed, and then she was running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx was at her side in an instant. He didn&#39;t ask questions, didn&#39;t demand explanations. He saw the fear in her eyes, the way her hands curled into fists, and he understood. Without hesitation, he followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The palace halls were endless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their boots pounded against the marble, the sound echoing in the cavernous corridors. Flickering torches lined the walls, their golden glow barely cutting through the heavy shadows. Servants pressed themselves against the stone, wide-eyed, as Aeliana and Tharx tore past them at an inhuman speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will make it,&#34; Tharx growled, his voice like thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s chest burned, her lungs straining, but she didn&#39;t slow. &#34;You don&#39;t know that,&#34; she snapped. Panic curled around her ribs like a vice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do.&#34; Tharx&#39;s voice was absolute. His golden eyes burned. &#34;Because if we don&#39;t-&#34; His jaw clenched, the muscles in his arms coiled like steel. &#34;Then the world will burn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana swallowed hard. He meant it. If Seraphina was harmed-if their child was gone-there would be no survivors. Tharx would tear the empire apart, leaving nothing but ashes in his wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vision blurred with rage and terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They turned a corner, and for a fleeting moment, she thought-we&#39;re too far. The halls were too long, the distance too great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>High-pitched. Terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nursemaid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s stomach dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assassin was already inside the nursery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved with the unshakable precision of a man who had done this before-many times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seraphina lay in her crib, tiny and unaware, swaddled in silken blankets. The faint glow of a lantern cast soft light over the room, illuminating the assassin&#39;s gleaming dagger, the wicked curve of its blade, the dark sheen of poison glistening along the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nursemaid, Lirena, turned too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened. Her breath hitched. But she didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved on instinct, throwing herself in front of the crib, arms outstretched, a living shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assassin struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blade whistled through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana hit him like a force of nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The impact sent them crashing into a nearby table, glass and porcelain shattering around them. The assassin grunted, his dagger flying from his grip, skidding across the marble floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana didn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drove her elbow into his ribs, reaching for her own blade, but he was faster. He rolled away, moving with a fluidity that only years of training could forge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, they stared at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you&#39;ve won?&#34; His voice was low, taunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s blood ran cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lunged-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could strike, before the assassin could speak another word-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he did not hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room shook as he hit the assassin with terrifying force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man barely had time to react before Tharx&#39;s blade plunged deep into his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, wet gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assassin&#39;s body jerked. His lips parted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile never faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as his life drained away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as Tharx ripped his dagger free and let his body fall to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s breath came ragged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only sound in the room was the soft whimpering of Seraphina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana staggered forward. Her hands were shaking as she reached for her daughter, lifting her from the crib, pressing her close to her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart slammed against her ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s breathing was heavy, his hands stained with blood. He didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still staring at the assassin&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana exhaled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s over,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as the words left her lips, she knew she was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s fingers curled into fists. His jaw clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not over,&#34; he said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Tharx-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he wasn&#39;t looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was looking at the body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, he crouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana held her breath as he reached out, gripping the assassin&#39;s tunic, pulling it slightly aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Branded into his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana had never seen it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Tharx had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because the moment his gaze landed on the mark-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His golden eyes darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana felt the weight of it settle over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is he?&#34; she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx didn&#39;t answer immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers tightened around the fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, finally-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He murmured something that made Aeliana&#39;s blood turn to ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was not acting alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung heavy in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And suddenly, Aeliana understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not just an attempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not just an assassin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And whoever had sent him-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were still watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana did not sleep that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat beside Seraphina&#39;s crib, her daughter&#39;s breath slow and even, her tiny fingers curled into delicate fists. The sight of her-so peaceful, so unaware of the horror that had unfolded mere hours ago- made something inside Aeliana snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could not let this happen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Tharx stood near the fireplace, his hands braced against the mantle, his entire body tense. The glow of the fire cast long shadows over his face, making him look almost inhuman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had not spoken since they left the nursery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His rage was too deep. Too silent. Too controlled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that terrified her more than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana rose, crossing the room until she stood beside him. She didn&#39;t touch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew she was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cannot kill a ghost,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s jaw tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana swallowed. &#34;You don&#39;t know who they are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tharx-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will burn them to the ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shivered. He meant it. Every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to face him, her voice quiet, but unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We cannot rule like this.&#34;</p>

                <p>Aeliana met his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We always have a choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time since Seraphina&#39;s birth, Tharx looked afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because for the first time-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had almost lost everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he was prepared to burn the world to the ground.</p>
