                <p>The palace was quiet in a way it hadn&#39;t been in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For so long, the walls had echoed with the sounds of war-battle cries, whispered conspiracies, the clang of steel, and the weight of threats both spoken and unspoken. The empire had been a battlefield, its rulers forever on guard, forever fighting, forever watching their backs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now there was only silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the kind that signaled something lurking in the shadows. Not the kind that warned of another betrayal waiting to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, this silence was different. This silence was peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana stood at the entrance of Seraphina&#39;s nursery, her hand resting lightly on the carved wooden doorframe. The room was dimly lit, the only glow coming from the soft amber lanterns flickering along the walls. The air smelled of lavender and the faintest traces of sandalwood-a soothing combination meant to ease restlessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in the center of the room, in the oversized chair draped with furs, Tharx held their daughter in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana didn&#39;t move. She hardly breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen Tharx in battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen him covered in blood, victorious, unyielding, merciless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen him break men with a single glance, conquer entire civilizations without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had never seen him like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His golden eyes, always sharp, always glowing with the quiet promise of power, were softer now. His expression, so often locked in grim determination, had eased into something unreadable but undeniably tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seraphina, their tiny, fragile daughter-the child so many had tried to kill before she could even walk-was curled against his chest, her small fingers clutching at the fabric of his tunic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana had spent weeks with Seraphina, waking for every feeding, soothing every cry, holding her through restless nights. And yet, even she had not managed to coax the kind of stillness from their daughter that Tharx had now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seraphina was completely at ease in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tiny chest rose and fell in steady breaths, her face relaxed, her grip on her father&#39;s tunic loose but sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Tharx Tharx did not move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not out of hesitation, not out of fear, but out of a reverence so uncharacteristic it left Aeliana breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For months, he had spoken of protecting their daughter. He had killed for her. He had gone to war for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, for the first time, Aeliana saw that he wasn&#39;t just protecting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was loving her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lump formed in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should leave them be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should turn back and let him have this moment without knowing he was being watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could step away, Tharx spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been standing there for five minutes,&#34; he murmured, not looking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana huffed softly, a small smile tugging at her lips. &#34;Have I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers, large and strong, ran lightly down Seraphina&#39;s back, soothing her in unconscious patterns. &#34;You think I don&#39;t know when you&#39;re near?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana crossed the room, her bare feet silent against the stone floor. &#34;You seemed preoccupied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx finally looked up at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And gods help her, she had to force herself to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had looked at her with possession before. With need. With hunger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he looked at her like she was something more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like she was his world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana lowered herself onto the footstool beside his chair, watching the way his arms tightened ever so slightly around Seraphina, as if to shield her from even the air itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s getting bigger,&#34; Aeliana murmured. &#34;Stronger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx nodded once. &#34;She has your stubbornness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana smirked. &#34;And your glare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx huffed. &#34;A necessary weapon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sat in comfortable silence, watching their daughter sleep soundly between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long moment, Tharx spoke again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never thought I would have one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana turned to him, watching the way his jaw tensed slightly, the way his fingers traced idle patterns against Seraphina&#39;s blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A child?&#34; she asked softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did not say it with regret. He did not say it with sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said it as a simple truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx had lived his life with the expectation of dying on a battlefield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of ruling until someone stronger came to take his throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never thought beyond survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, here he was, holding their child, speaking of the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana felt something shift inside her. Something she hadn&#39;t realized she had been waiting for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now?&#34; she asked, keeping her voice soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s golden eyes met hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, I cannot imagine an empire without you in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For all his sharp edges, for all his dominance, Tharx did not offer words lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never been the kind to give meaningless reassurances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not just a reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana reached up, brushing her fingers lightly against Seraphina&#39;s soft, wispy hair, feeling the weight of their daughter&#39;s presence between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is different, isn&#39;t it?&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx watched her carefully. &#34;What is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana let out a slow breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before, it was about survival.&#34; She met his gaze fully, her expression unguarded. &#34;Now, it&#39;s about something more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx was silent for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with deliberate care, he shifted Seraphina so she rested more securely against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he said finally. &#34;It is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Aeliana knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had built an empire together, forged in blood and fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they were forging a family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there was nothing-nothing-that could take that away from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for him, lacing her fingers with his, feeling the solid warmth of his hand wrap around hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx squeezed gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana did not smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not need to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because in this moment, for the first time in a very, very long time-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were not just rulers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were home.</p>
