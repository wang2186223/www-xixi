                <p>Aeliana watched as Tharx entered the council chamber, his tall frame cutting a commanding figure even in the dim light. The air in the room seemed to shift whenever he walked in, the low murmurs of the alien advisors quieting immediately as all attention turned to him. He gave her a curt nod, his face an impenetrable mask, as he took his seat at the head of the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the past several weeks, he had asked her to observe these meetings. At first, it had been unnerving to sit among the alien elite-warriors, diplomats, and advisors-none of whom had much regard for a human in their midst. But Tharx had insisted, though he had not explained his reasons. He&#39;d made it clear that while she was permitted to observe, her opinions were not welcome. Yet, something had changed in recent days. More than once, she had caught his gaze flickering toward her when a particularly contentious topic was brought up. It was almost as though he was gauging her reaction, searching for some unspoken counsel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, the council was debating a crucial matter: whether to deploy troops to the border territories where unrest had begun to brew once more. Several advisors argued passionately for immediate action, while others insisted on a more cautious approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx listened to the arguments in silence, his eyes fixed on the map projected before them, outlining the areas where the trouble had started. The room buzzed with the intensity of the discussion, and Aeliana&#39;s gaze wandered to him, her brow furrowing as she noticed the way his jaw tightened ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the meeting concluded, Tharx dismissed the council and motioned for Aeliana to follow him into the adjoining chamber. His tone was matter-of-fact as he spoke, though there was an unusual softness in his voice. &#34;You&#39;ve attended several of these meetings now,&#34; he said, not turning to face her. &#34;What would you do if you were me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question startled her. Aeliana blinked, her mind racing. It was the first time he had asked her opinion outright. &#34;I I would try diplomacy first,&#34; she replied carefully. &#34;Rushing in with force might provoke more resistance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to her, one eyebrow slightly raised. &#34;Diplomacy has its limits, especially with those who only respect power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That may be true,&#34; Aeliana admitted, &#34;but even the show of considering a peaceful approach could earn you support among those who are undecided. It might buy you time to prepare for a conflict if it becomes inevitable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s gaze lingered on her for a moment, as if weighing her words. &#34;You speak as though you have ruled an empire yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not an empire,&#34; she said quietly, &#34;but I have seen what happens when leaders use force without considering the consequences. It only strengthens their enemies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a flicker of something in Tharx&#39;s eyes-respect, perhaps, or the slightest hint of curiosity. &#34;You see much, Aeliana,&#34; he murmured. &#34;More than most of my advisors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words unsettled her. This was the same man who had taken her from her world, who had kept her captive and at a distance. Yet now, there were small cracks in his cold exterior, moments where the rigid façade slipped just enough for her to glimpse a person behind the title of alien king. These conversations, however brief, left her feeling disoriented and conflicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped closer, the air between them thickening. &#34;You still fear me,&#34; he observed, his voice a low rumble. &#34;Even now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d be a fool not to,&#34; Aeliana replied, her tone steady but edged with defiance. &#34;You&#39;re still the one who brought me here against my will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And yet, here you stand, speaking your mind to me.&#34; Tharx&#39;s eyes softened, and he turned away abruptly, the moment of intimacy passing as quickly as it had come. &#34;Return to your chambers. I have other matters to attend to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked back through the long, winding corridors, Aeliana couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that there was more to Tharx than he allowed anyone to see. His behavior toward her had shifted recently, becoming more complex, even contradictory. At times, he was as distant and unyielding as ever, but there were other moments, like this one, where he sought out her company, even asked for her opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, a guard arrived at her quarters, instructing her to follow him. Aeliana was taken to a secluded part of the fortress-a room she had never seen before. It was dimly lit, with large windows that overlooked the sprawling city below. Tharx stood at the far end of the room, his gaze fixed on the horizon, as if contemplating something far beyond the reach of the empire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You brought me here to talk about diplomacy?&#34; she asked, trying to keep her tone neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he replied without turning. &#34;I brought you here to understand something.&#34; He finally turned to face her, and there was a rare, almost vulnerable look in his eyes. &#34;Tell me, how do humans choose their leaders?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question seemed oddly personal, and Aeliana hesitated before answering. &#34;In many places, it&#39;s through elections. People vote for the candidate they believe will represent their interests best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Candidates,&#34; Tharx repeated, the word foreign on his tongue. &#34;And what makes one candidate better than another?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It depends on what people value,&#34; Aeliana explained. &#34;Strength, intelligence, empathy, the ability to connect with people The qualities vary, but the common thread is that people want someone they can believe in, someone who will protect them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was contemplative. &#34;And do you believe that I am such a leader?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana felt the weight of his question. &#34;You are strong,&#34; she said carefully. &#34;And your people fear you. But I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the same as believing in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flickered with a shadow of something she couldn&#39;t quite place-anger, perhaps, or hurt. &#34;Belief is earned, you think?&#34; He turned back toward the window. &#34;Then I have much work to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a step closer, her voice softening. &#34;There&#39;s more to ruling than being feared, Tharx. Sometimes, strength is shown by understanding when not to use it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long silence before Tharx spoke again, his voice low and rough. &#34;My father once told me that power is best wielded when it is never questioned.&#34; His tone shifted, taking on an edge. &#34;He was wrong, of course. Power is always questioned. Always challenged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s breath caught. This was the first time Tharx had ever spoken about his past, even briefly. She could sense the bitterness in his words, the weight of old wounds. She wondered what kind of ruler his father had been, and how that had shaped the man before her. &#34;It&#39;s not a weakness to let people see you,&#34; she said quietly. &#34;Not entirely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed then, a dark and humorless sound. &#34;And what would you know of such things, little human?&#34; But there was no real malice in his words-only a guardedness, a reluctance to allow himself to be understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx dismissed her shortly after, returning to the cold distance that had characterized much of their time together. But as Aeliana walked back to her quarters, she couldn&#39;t help but feel that a small shift had occurred. Their conversations were not yet trust, but they were something. A fragile bond, perhaps, one that could grow stronger-or shatter completely-depending on what came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cracks in Tharx&#39;s cold demeanor were there, faint but undeniable, and Aeliana found herself drawn to them, even if it meant facing the uncertainty of what lay beneath.</p>
