                <p>The first sign of the attack came as a tremor beneath the fortress walls, faint but unmistakable. Aeliana sat in her chambers, staring at the flickering light of a lone lamp, when the ground beneath her feet seemed to shift, the vibration rattling the glass on her table. She stood, her heart pounding as the muffled sounds of shouting reached her ears. The calm that had settled over the fortress in recent days was shattered in an instant, replaced by a rising tide of chaos that seemed to creep through the very walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside her room, the sounds of clashing metal grew louder, punctuated by the sharp cries of soldiers barking orders. Something was wrong-terribly wrong. Aeliana pressed her ear to the door, her pulse quickening as she tried to make sense of the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the door burst open, and one of her guards stumbled inside, blood staining his armor. &#34;Stay here,&#34; he commanded, his voice tight with urgency. &#34;Do not leave this room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; Aeliana demanded, her voice shaking. &#34;Is it Draxis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard didn&#39;t answer, his focus already on the corridor as he drew his weapon and disappeared back into the fray, leaving Aeliana alone once again. She hesitated for only a moment before grabbing the nearest object she could find-a small, jagged piece of alien decor that she hoped could serve as a makeshift weapon. She wasn&#39;t about to wait idly while chaos unfolded around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the war room, Tharx stood at the center of the storm, his commanders rushing to relay information as reports of the breach poured in. Draxis&#39;s forces had struck swiftly, breaching the outer defenses with a precision that spoke to months of careful planning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enemy troops have infiltrated the west wing!&#34; one of his generals shouted, slamming a fist on the table. &#34;They&#39;re pushing toward the inner halls. It&#39;s clear they know the fortress layout.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s expression darkened, his jaw tightening as he surveyed the battle map. Draxis had timed his attack perfectly, exploiting the political tensions within the fortress to sow confusion and disarray. Tharx had prepared for an attack, but not one executed with this level of precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rally the troops in the central courtyard,&#34; Tharx commanded, his voice sharp and unyielding. &#34;We cannot allow them to split our forces.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, my king,&#34; another advisor interjected, his voice laced with unease, &#34;their strategy suggests they are after more than just a show of strength. This could be a diversion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;What are you suggesting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The advisor hesitated, his gaze darting toward the door. &#34;We should consider the possibility that Draxis has a specific target in mind-one that would cripple morale if taken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned on Tharx like a hammer blow. His thoughts immediately went to Aeliana, confined in her chambers, vulnerable despite the guards stationed outside. He turned to a nearby soldier. &#34;Double the guards in the east wing. Ensure-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, a messenger burst into the room, his face pale. &#34;My king, the east wing has fallen. Lady Aeliana... she has been taken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana fought with everything she had, her makeshift weapon clutched tightly in her hands as she faced the soldiers who had stormed her quarters. The guards assigned to her had been overwhelmed in moments, their bodies lying crumpled on the floor as Draxis&#39;s soldiers closed in around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; she screamed, slashing at the nearest attacker with her jagged weapon. She managed to graze his arm, drawing blood, but it wasn&#39;t enough. Another soldier grabbed her from behind, his grip like iron as he wrenched the weapon from her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kicked and struggled, her fury giving her strength, but it was no use. The soldiers subdued her quickly, binding her wrists and hauling her out into the corridor. The fortress halls, once a place of cold but familiar security, now teemed with Draxis&#39;s forces. Bodies littered the ground, the air heavy with the smell of blood and smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aeliana&#39;s mind raced as she was dragged through the chaos. She had known Draxis was a threat, but she hadn&#39;t realized just how far he would go-or how much of a target she had become. Her life was no longer just her own; it had become a bargaining chip in Draxis&#39;s game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the war room, Tharx&#39;s fury erupted as the news of Aeliana&#39;s capture spread through the council. He slammed his fist on the table, the force of the blow reverberating through the room. &#34;How did this happen?&#34; he demanded, his voice a roar of anger that left no room for excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kadrin, one of his more vocal advisors, stepped forward, his expression grim. &#34;Draxis has outmaneuvered us, my king. His forces knew exactly where to strike. It&#39;s clear he has spies within the fortress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now he has Aeliana,&#34; Tharx growled, his glowing eyes flashing with barely restrained rage. &#34;He&#39;ll use her as leverage-he&#39;ll demand concessions, challenge my authority.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another advisor nodded solemnly. &#34;The message is clear, my king. Draxis wants to force you to choose-her life or your empire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of those words settled over the room like a shroud. Tharx&#39;s mind raced, his emotions a tumult of anger, guilt, and desperation. He had known that Aeliana&#39;s presence made her a target, but he had underestimated the lengths Draxis would go to exploit her. And now, she was in enemy hands, her fate uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx turned to his commanders, his voice cold and resolute. &#34;We will not negotiate. Mobilize every available soldier and prepare for a counterstrike. I will not allow Draxis to hold this fortress-or this empire-hostage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the council chambers, the fallout from Aeliana&#39;s capture was immediate. The nobles were divided, some blaming Tharx for allowing her to remain in the fortress, others seeing her abduction as proof of Draxis&#39;s cunning. The council&#39;s unity, already fragile, was now teetering on the edge of collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a disaster,&#34; one advisor muttered, pacing the room. &#34;Draxis has made his move, and we are left scrambling. The people will see this as weakness-proof that Tharx cannot protect even those closest to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another council member glared at Tharx. &#34;And what will you do now, my king? Sacrifice your empire for one human? Or will you let her die to preserve your rule?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharx&#39;s gaze darkened, his voice sharp as he replied. &#34;This council will not dictate my actions. Draxis&#39;s coup ends here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council fell silent, but the unease lingered, the fractures within their ranks growing wider. Tharx&#39;s authority was under siege not just from Draxis, but from the very people who were meant to support him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the aftermath of the battle, Tharx retreated to his chambers, his mind a storm of conflicting emotions. He had failed to protect Aeliana, failed to anticipate the full extent of Draxis&#39;s ambitions. And now, she was gone, her life in the hands of a man who would stop at nothing to see Tharx&#39;s empire fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Tharx allowed himself to feel the full weight of his anger and regret. His mind replayed the moments leading up to her capture, the choices he had made that had allowed this to happen. He had tried to protect her by keeping her at a distance, but in doing so, he had left her vulnerable to his enemies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Aeliana in Draxis&#39;s hands filled him with a rage he could barely contain. She had become more than just a responsibility, more than a pawn in the political games of his empire. She was a part of him now, whether he was ready to admit it or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he would stop at nothing to bring her back.</p>
