                <p>Layla was sleeping soundly and peacefully when someone walked into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes squinted on seeing her on his bed, sleeping. What was she doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Striding to where she laid, he tapped her roughly and Layla jerked up from the bed in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; His voice thundered in her ears as Layla wore a confused look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Nolan doing here and why was he disturbing her sleep?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had she done this time that made him angry again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh..si&#34; she paused as she recollected that he had warned her not to address him as sir again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Adlen..&#34; she uttered, rubbing her sleepy eyes. As she wondered what sort of a devil he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t care to ask about her health, even when he said he would take responsibility for her, now he was disturbing her sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; He asked again with a stoic expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#34; Layla repeated in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop acting dumb and answer me!&#34; He yelled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keisha brought me here, she said I would be staying in this room..&#34; Layla replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keisha told her to stay here, then why was he creating a ruckus out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keisha..&#34; he gritted his teeth. She always acted cunning, she must have brought Layla to his room on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ge..&#34; he was about to drive her out when the door sprang open and Keisha walked in with a maid driving a trolley with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you know how to knock!&#34; Nolan snapped at the both of them and the maid instantly flinched in fear but Keisha maintained her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry..&#34; she apologized. Though she could be naughty at times, she knew better not to annoy Nolan. Everyone knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla had not eaten since she came, so I brought some food for her, I had no idea you were here, sorry&#34; she apologized sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you bring her here?&#34; He questioned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where was I supposed to bring her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell me that you&#39;re thinking of letting her stay in the guest room, huh?&#34; Keisha gasped in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serve the Luna her meal before it gets cold..&#34; Keisha instructed but the maid didn&#39;t move as she waited for Nolan&#39;s approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Serve her meal..&#34; he uttered and the maid moved into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See you later, Layla..&#34; Keisha waved leaving the room with the maid after she was done serving Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can leave if you want..&#34; Layla spoke. She had no idea it was his room. She was so tired that she didn&#39;t have the strength to ask or look around, she just slumped on the bed and slept off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can stay..&#34; he waved her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would be weird If we stay in different rooms..&#34; he added, taking a seat in the cushion as Layla shook her head slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sweet aroma of the food hitting her nostrils made her salivate more. She was starving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tray was placed before her on the bed and she contemplated if she should leave his bed and eat elsewhere. She didn&#39;t want another round of scolding from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should..&#34; she made her way to leave but Nolan stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead and eat, the maids will change the sheets once you&#39;re done..&#34; he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla looked away from him, fixing her attention on the different variety of dishes served in front of her. She was fucking hungry and did not care if Nolan was in the same room with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was somewhat thankful that he was calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately descended on her food, not caring about any other thing in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing Layla didn&#39;t joke with was her meals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan fixed his eyes throughout the whole time that she ate, she kept stuffing food into her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was unlike the other ladies who ate slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Layla was done, she gulped down the glass of juice in front of her and she exhaled sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she felt satiated. If she could go back to bed and sleep off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to stand up from the bed when she heard him speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ummreturning the plates..&#34; she spluttered, swallowing nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a Luna Layla, act like one..&#34; he blurted out as Layla wondered what she had done wrong this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only wanted to return the plates. Was there a problem with that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone will take care of that, a maid will be here any minute&#34; he informed as Layla had no choice but to sit back and wait for the maid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to his words about a minute later, a maid came in to clear the plates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now only the two of them were left in the room and Layla found it uncomfortable. But then she remembered she wanted to ask him for a favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it necessary we live together in New York?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes..&#34; came his short reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla bit her lips in frustration when she heard his reply. She wanted to visit the hospital and she couldn&#39;t do that when she was living with him. It could expose her secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to ask if I can stay with Aurora for two days before I come live with you..&#34; she proposed, picking her nails as she hoped he would accept her request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No..&#34; he bluntly refused and Layla felt her heart squeeze. This was going to be a lot harder than sfe thought. She even wanted to ask if she could tell Aurora about Lycans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Mr Alden, I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Nolan..&#34; he corrected nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Nol..an&#34; she stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to give a reasonable excuse for leaving and I haven&#39;t even packed my things yet, so please..&#34; she begged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to pack your things, I&#39;m not going to allow you to wear rags under my roof..&#34; he spat deadpanning on the words &#34;rags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get you a new set of clothes..&#34; he informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please sir, I ask for just this favor..&#34; she begged still. She was very pissed that he called her clothed rags. Her clothes were not rags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go..&#34; he finally accepted and Layla muttered a thanks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan glanced at her repeatedly as he wondered what exactly she was doing in New York.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They met in Seattle and she had mentioned that her sister cheated on her with her boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She talked about maltreatment and betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that the actual reason why she left Seattle to come to New York?</p>
