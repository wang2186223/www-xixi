                <p>&#34;Oh, swear I&#39;m going to kill you once I lay my hands on you. Where the hell have you been?&#34; Aurora yelled over the phone, and Layla had to take the phone away from her ear, or she might lose her hearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine; my battery died, that&#39;s why I&#39;ve not been able to call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But where are you? It&#39;s pouring heavily, and it&#39;s late.&#34; Layla chuckled at her overprotectiveness. Aurora tended to be overprotective of her ever since the day she got bullied in high school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m at my boss&#39;s place,&#34; Layla informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your boss!!! What if he does something to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; Layla sighed, typical Aurora, always being the overprotective one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had something important to deal with, but the rain caught up with me, so I had to spend a night. Stop being a mama bear; I&#39;m fine,&#34; Layla tried assuring her, or she might never calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, take care of yourself, and don&#39;t forget to call me if anything comes up. Love you, Layla,&#34; she blew a kiss at her, and the call got disconnected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla inhaled sharply, throwing herself on the bed tiredly. After a few minutes, she went to the bathroom to have a hot shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, they fit quite well,&#34; she said, taking a look at Nolan&#39;s clothes. Though they were ten times bigger than her, they fit her, and she looked cute in them. Layla quickly rushed to the kitchen to make food for herself. She decided to make spaghetti and meatballs for her and Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never wanted to cook for him but decided to do so out of humanity. He let her stay at his place and gave her clothes to wear. It was the little she could do to say thank you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she was done preparing the meal, she served Nolan&#39;s portion first and went straight to the room he had entered earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir Nolan,&#34; she called softly, knocking at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir,&#34; she knocked again after about two minutes as she didn&#39;t get an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Si...&#34; she was about to knock for the third time when the door sprang open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want!?&#34; He snapped coldly the moment she opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, I thought that I could...&#34; Layla never got to finish her statement as Maddox came out of nowhere running towards her as he barked. She was so frightened that she jerked off, and the tray she was holding slipped from her hands, shattering to pieces immediately it fell on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you gone mad?&#34; He screamed at her in fury. He never asked her for anything, but yet she came and created a huge mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry, sir,&#34; Layla apologized, bending down quickly to pick up the spilled spaghetti and the broken pieces of glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oww,&#34; she winced in pain. A broken piece of glass had torn through her flesh, not only that the spaghetti was still hot, and it burned her feet. Yet still, she resolved to clean the mess she had created.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must have definitely gone mad; how are you going to do this with your bare hands? Stand up now and stop acting dumb!&#34; He stated, yanking her up from the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry, sir,&#34; Layla apologized and attempted to move away but she only ended up stepping on a broken piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oww,&#34; she winced as blood soon began to flow from there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop moving for fuck&#39;s sake; there are broken glasses everywhere, are you this dumb or just trying to be!&#34; He glared menacingly at her as he carried her off the ground. She was not even wearing slippers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried her into his room, slamming the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit there and don&#39;t move,&#34; he instructed, dropping her on a sofa. Layla sat down obediently, the stupid dog Maddox, the reason for the mess, was long gone; he was never coming at her in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around his room, which was alarmingly very huge and nice too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over to his bedside, and he picked up a telephone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clean the mess in front of my room,&#34; he instructed before placing the telephone back in its place. Layla sat quietly, wondering if anyone else lived in this house. He mentioned that he lived alone. Then she recalled that they were in a penthouse; he probably had workers in the main building and had decided to live alone for his reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t get hurt while you&#39;re under my care,&#34; he said, bringing out a first aid kit from a drawer before going back to where she sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can do that elsewhere,&#34; he said scornfully, holding up her injured hand, and he tended to get wounds. Layla sat unmoving as she watched him tend to her wound; he was gentle, which didn&#39;t sound right at all. A person like him could not be described as gentle. From her perspective, he was rude and didn&#39;t know how to talk to women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to your room,&#34; he stated after he was done wrapping her finger with a bandage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful from now and don&#39;t get hurt under my roof,&#34; he warned as Layla muttered a thank you before walking out. She saw that the place had already been cleaned up; it was as if nothing ever happened there in the first place. She quietly went to the kitchen to have her portion of food. No matter what, there was something Layla could never afford to miss, that was her meal. Nolan can scold her till the end of the world, but that will not stop her from eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To hell with him,&#34; Layla thought, relishing the sweet taste of the food she made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m surely a good cook,&#34; she praised herself. After wrapping everything up, she washed the plates she used in eating before heading for her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night, jackass,&#34; she glared at his room before going into her room to retire for the night.</p>
