                <p>&#34;I&#39;m at a club&#34; came Xander&#39;s reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of there immediately!&#34; Nolan instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, on it&#34; Xander responded, he could hear the urgency in Nolan&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m out, do you need anything?&#34; Xander asked after coming out of the club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that? And how&#39;s your trip going?&#34; Xander queried walking over to his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is Layla doing? Do you still plan on rejecting her? It&#39;s almost midnight&#34; Xander blabbed non-stop as Nolan growled in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop asking baseless questions and listen!&#34; He yelled as Layla glanced sharply at him wondering why he was always in a bad mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened? Why did you sound tense, wait&#34; Xander gasped as if he just realized something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did anything happen between you and Layla?&#34; He asked with a sly grin on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come over to Seattle immediately &#34; Nolan instructed, ignoring Xander&#39;s questions. Knowing the kind of friend he had and how sly he tended to be. He would never stop trying to get on his nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is there anything you want me to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I want you to help me catch a certain someone&#34; Nolan began. Hayes would never go scot free. He only let him go, because he had to get Layla to safety, but that didn&#39;t mean Hayes was safe. He would suffer forever thinking that he could take him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s it?&#34; Xander asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hayes Keith&#34; replied Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The one you&#39;re supposed to have a business meeting with right?&#34; Xander asked in confusion as he wondered why Nolan wanted him to fly over to Seattle to catch a person. When he&#39;s right there in Seattle. He should just catch Hayes himself unless something was up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it happened that he had ulterior motives, he tried to kill me&#34; Nolan informed as he scoffed inwardly at the thought of the fact that Hayes actually thought of killing him. What a fool!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swore to break Hayes Keith bones once he laid his hands on him, his story will be a lesson for others who are planning to rebel against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?? Is Layla alright?&#34; Xander squealed, getting into his car in a hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she&#39;s fine&#34; Nolan replied, sparing a glance at Layla who sat quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good&#34; Xander breathed out in relief. He was worried about Layla, not Nolan. Nolan could take care of himself but not Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you guys now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m driving, I&#39;m going over to my lake house&#34; Nolan replied, he was sure Hayes and his men had lost track of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he couldn&#39;t return back to the hotel. Hayes must have an idea about the hotel he lodged at and might try something stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll get back at you once I get a hold of Hayes, ok already working on his current location&#34; Xander uttered typing on his laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me a phone call when you get a hold of him..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will, please keep Layla safe&#34; Xander pleaded but Nolan ignored him as usual and just disconnected the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After disconnecting the call, he went ahead to call his Beta, Darren.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Alpha&#34; Darren said on picking the call up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the serious minded one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s everything going on in the pack?&#34; Nolan questioned, if Hayes tried harming him he can also try harming his pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good and peaceful&#34; came Darren&#39;s reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is anything the problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really, tighten the security around the pack and watch out for Hayes Keith, imprison everyone in his pack&#34; Nolan instructed. Hayes happened to be the brother of a werewolf Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, everyone including the Alpha, everyone&#34; Nolan deadpanned. Hayes just committed a grave sin and his family will pay for his sins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I may ask, what&#39;s the reason for this arrest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Treason, he attempted murder on the life of the supreme Alpha&#34; he informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright I&#39;m on it, I&#39;ll get my men ready &#34; Darren assured as Nolan disconnected the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla just sat in confusion and bewilderment, just tonight her eyes had seen a lot of things that she couldn&#39;t even talk about or even knew existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan growing fangs, werewolves, packs and all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that they really existed? She thought it was just all a fairy tale but she has witnessed a lot of things today that she had no choice but to believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had been shot, twice. But he looked just fine and was driving. If it was a normal human, that person would have dropped dead a long time ago but he looked just fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered how he had been managing with a gunshot and what the hell a pack was?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Si..&#34; she began as she wanted to ask about his health, though he looked like he has been managing just fine. She still needed to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at her, telling her to shut up with his eyes, Layla immediately held back, she should have just minded her business. Nolan was a huge force to reckon with.</p>
