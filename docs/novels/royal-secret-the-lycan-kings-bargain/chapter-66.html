                <p>Layla sucked in a deep breath as she turned to face Xander. There was no point in denying it anymore, the truth was already out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34; she confirmed and Xander&#39;s face suddenly wore a look of disappointment. So scarlet was right after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s responsible for the pregnancy, Layla?&#34; He asked, trying to keep his cool. Has Layla been lying to them all this while?</p>

                <p>&#34;Nolan?&#34; His eyes narrowed as she looked at her with a questioning gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Nolan is the father of my child and please Xander don&#39;t tell him about this..&#34; she pleaded. Her plan was to beg Xander to keep the truth from Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I shouldn&#39;t tell him about this?&#34; Xander questioned as he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you even saying Layla, how sure am I that you&#39;re telling the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I clearly heard when your sister said you got pregnant way back in Seattle and that was the reason you moved to New York, so how does any of this make sense? &#34; he pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know none of this makes sense Xander but you have to trust me when I say Nolan and I met way back in Seattle&#34; She informed hoping he&#39;d buy that. She was not sure if Nolan had ever mentioned that to Xander or anybody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was on the 28th of March, just about two months ago. I swear on the life of my unborn baby I&#39;m not lying Xander..&#34; She only mentioned the date so that Xander could recollect if Nolan was out of town by that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We met at a bar. I only went there because I caught my sister f*cking my boyfriend. I got drunk, met with Nolan and you know what happens after that..&#34; she concluded trying to sound convincing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not come to New York because Nolan lived here. I only came here Scarlet and my stepmom was a threat to my unborn baby and I had no one else aside from Aurora. Meeting Nolan again and discovering that we were mates was just a pure coincidence. Trust me I was ready to move on without the father..&#34; she added as she waited for his reply but he didn&#39;t say anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know this may sound absurd but I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe you Layla..&#34; he interrupted and Layla breathed out in relief. Now she can reason things out with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes..&#34; he replied. From all the explanation she gave, he knew that she was telling the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Nolan went for a business trip in Seattle on the exact same date Layla had mentioned. He returned moody and angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he confronted Nolan about it. Nolan told him that he met his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered shouting at Nolan for leaving his mate back there in Seattle but Nolan stated that he didn&#39;t want anything to do with her and wished that she never appeared again in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as time went on, Layla appeared in New York as Nolan&#39;s secretary and now they&#39;re mated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re telling the truth Layla, I believe you&#34; he reassured holding her by her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you..&#34; she breathed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what I didn&#39;t understand is this&#34; he began withdrawing backwards from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you keeping this a secret, why haven&#39;t you told Nolan yet?&#34; He grilled curiously. As he wondered why she would keep such big news from everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;m not ready yet..&#34; she says out curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Xander, I didn&#39;t want you to say anything about this. I&#39;ll handle this myself..&#34; She guaranteed. Now another person aside from Aurora knew about her secret. She had to be careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why are you so intent on hiding the news about your pregnancy, I mean this is going to be good news..&#34; Xander emphasized. Not only would Nolan have a Luna, they would also be expecting a baby. This was such good news for the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet Xander..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you know how my relationship with Nolan is. You know he hates me and doesn&#39;t trust me at all. I don&#39;t know what he will do if I tell him about this. His reaction and all. That&#39;s why I want to take things easy..&#34; she stated hoping he would agree with her and keep her secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to be scared Layla, I&#39;m here for you and I can deal with Nolan. Trust me he&#39;s going to believe you. You both are mates and he feels every f*cking emotions inside of you. there&#39;s no way he&#39;s not going to trust you and I know he would never hurt you..&#34; he said out softly trying to convince her to say the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know anything Xander..&#34; Layla voiced out. Easy for him to say that Nolan would never hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan did not give a damn about her, if he had the chance to reject her as his mate. He would have done that a long time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only that, he calls that night a huge mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he ever accept a child that resulted from a mistake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Layla..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xander please..&#34; Layla stopped him from saying anything further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just promise me one thing. Promise me that you&#39;ll tell no one about this, not even Nolan&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just promise this. I&#39;ll handle this myself..&#34; she interrupted holding his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Xander, I&#39;m begging you for just this favor..&#34; she begged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right. I will not say anything about this&#34; he finally obliged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks Xander..&#34; Layla appreciated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But on one condition..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; Layla asked as her brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This will not go on for long. If it takes too long, I&#39;ll have to spill the beans myself..&#34; he said. He had never lied to Nolan but was just doing this for Layla&#39;s sake because he respected her a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay I will..&#34; she accepted his terms before then, she would think of something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can get back to work, I&#39;ll take care of the CCTV footage outside..&#34; he informed. One of the cameras must have captured Scarlet talking about Layla&#39;s pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really appreciate this Xander. I&#39;ll see you later..&#34; she quickly hurried away as she had spent too much time aside and the lunch break was over a long time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just hoped Nolan hadn&#39;t stepped out of his office since then or he&#39;d definitely scold her.</p>
