                <p>Layla stepped out of her room ready for work as she walked to the sitting room, where she saw Nolan sitting there over a cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning..&#34; She greeted him unsure if that was the right thing to do after what happened the previous day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But nonetheless she wanted something from him that was why she greeted because she would rather act like he didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m off to work..&#34; she informed him softly. That was what she wanted from him. She didn&#39;t know if he changed his mind after what happened yesterday and might use that as a means to punish her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m off to work..&#34; she said again seeing that he did not give her a reply.</p>

                <p>&#34;What the f*ck do you want me to do about it?&#34; He snapped coldly at her. So he was still pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well he could be angry to the extent of hitting his head against the wall for all Layla cared.</p>

                <p>&#34;Get lost..&#34; he waved her off and Layla quickly ran out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t change his mind after all, Layla was very happy to hear that. She was finally out after two days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not have her breakfast, so she decided to get one on her way to work as she didn&#39;t want to spend another moment with Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning Bertha..&#34; Layla waved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning Layla..&#34; Bertha waved back at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait Layla!&#34; She called out as if she just remembered something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, can I help you with anything?&#34; Layla asked, stopping in front of Bertha&#39;s desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually yes ... .wait no..&#34; she stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I should get going if you don&#39;t need anything..&#34; Layla was about to walk out when Bertha dragged her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait&#34; she held Layla&#39;s wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to ask you a question..&#34; she began chuckling sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right, be fast with your question. I have something important to do..&#34; Layla chimed in taking a look at her watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, chill Layla, the president has not come yet..&#34; she said smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have work to do..&#34; Layla pointed out. She had been away for two days so there&#39;d definitely be lots of work waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spill Bertha I have to go..&#34; she motioned for Bertha to speak up. She needed to take her drugs as she did not take them at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, okay..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why weren&#39;t you at work for two days?&#34; Bertha asked and Layla felt like walking away immediately. Why did she love boring people&#39;s personal life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was sick..&#34; came Layla curt reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I see. But you don&#39;t look sick to me..&#34; Bertha said sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously Bertha..&#34; Layla narrowed her eyes in a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to upset you. You look stunning Layla, actually. You don&#39;t look sick. One would think you went on a vacation..&#34; she shrugged her shoulders as she secretly admired Layla&#39;s beauty and her expensive dressing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell me you stopped me to tell me this?&#34; Layla raised a brow at Bertha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should have just minded her business a while ago and passed by without greeting anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No that&#39;s not it Layla seriously..&#34; she shook her hands on the hair defensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just that everyone thought that you were fired..&#34; she began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you know, I was not!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They said the reason for the president firing you was because you tried to seduce him and seeing the way he sent you out&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was not trying to seduce anybody Bertha and he only sent me out because I was feeling sick and you know how Nolan is&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan?&#34; Bertha looked at Layla with a questioning gaze as Layla quickly clasped her mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt so annoyed at that very moment, they tended to spread rumors about her and the worst part of it all was that she did not even know the people that spread these rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only people she spoke to in the office were Bertha and Xander and they were the only people she knew that names, the rest were nothing but colleagues who she hardly spoke to as she was always working in her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I meant the president..&#34; She quickly corrected herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You call him by his name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a slip of the tongue Bertha, please..&#34; she begged, obviously tired of all of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan was to walk quietly like a ghost now stupid rumors were flying round about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Layla really. I&#39;m sorry if all these made you angry..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;m only telling you this because I&#39;m a good person and I know you had no idea about these rumors..&#34; she pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Bertha, but seriously I don&#39;t want to hear any of it. Because there&#39;s nothing I can do to stop these rumors from spreading..&#34; she said. They could say whatever they wanted, she didn&#39;t care one bit about it, because it added nothing meaningful to her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I can assure you of this. I was sick that&#39;s why I was not able to come to work and Nolan only sent me out because of the same reason..&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan?&#34; Bertha stared intently at her as if she was a suspect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems as if you&#39;re very comfortable with calling the president by his name seeing the way it just rolls out of your tongue..&#34; she reasoned stating a fact there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it would be really nice if you both have something going on between you. Come to think of it, the president is good looking and you&#39;re also very pretty. What a perfect match..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bertha please, stop this already..&#34; Layla pleaded. This was something Nolan warned her about, people finding out about them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he heard any of the rumors, he could easily assume that she started it purposely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you also began to wear very expensive clothes..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you it was a gift..&#34; Layla interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got a full closet as a gift?&#34; Bertha asked in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what?&#34; Layla began in surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m leaving, see you soon..&#34; she waved, walking away. She just couldn&#39;t fathom why someone would be so interested in a person&#39;s personal life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was it any of Bertha business if she wore expensive clothes, they should learn when to shut up!</p>
