                <p>Layla sighed in exasperation as she quickly wore her clothes, a Jean pant with a tank top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was more than frustrated right at this moment, her problems didn&#39;t seem to be ending, first it was when she broke a very expensive vase, then she had an asthma attack, now Nolan had told her to get dressed that they&#39;ll be visiting a mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to him, he was having a dinner with some clients and she would be like his plus one. That was the main reason he brought her along in the first place, to pose as his date, because since she came here, she had not done anything meaningful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She combed her hair and noticed that it was getting longer. She needed to visit the salon and get her hair done but that will be in New York, not here in Seattle. She can&#39;t afford to come across any one she knows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She packed her hair backwards before coming out of the bathroom to see Nolan waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ready sir&#34; she announced and Nolan stood up from the chair walking straight right out of the door, Layla following suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pick a black dress for her, the one that will suit her perfectly&#34; Nolan instructed the salesgirl on duty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok sir&#34; the sales girl blushed hard. Layla scoffed at the sight of the salesgirl and other breathing female ogling at Nolan. Well she wouldn&#39;t blame them, he was handsome and the clothes he wore made him look more like a high school boy crush not a CEO.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they were busy admiring him, she was busy feeling uneasy as she kept shifting uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This mall is very popular in Seattle, in fact scarlet visited the mall a lot. Layla was scared of meeting her by chance, her step sister tended to blab a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll show you some of our latest designs&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nono..need, I&#39;ll pick something up myself &#34; Layla offered, faking a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she allowed the salesgirl to pick up a dress for her, she would spend the whole eternity waiting, so it was better she picked up the clothes herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla swore on choosing the first dress she came across with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll show you where you can find beautiful dresses &#34; Layla and the salesgirl left to pick up a dress and Nolan stood at the counter waiting for them. He had no plans of following Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a vintage dress, there&#39;s only two available in the country&#34; the salesgirl informed showing Layla , a beautiful black dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a mini gown that would stop above her knees. The dress was adorned with stones which made it look very unique.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla immediately fell in love with this but there was no way she was going to choose it because it would be fucking expensive. It was a limited edition for fuck sake. Many ladies wouldn&#39;t mind getting their hands dirty to get this dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need, I&#39;ll opt for something cheaper&#34; Layla quickly declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something cheaper!! Your boyfriend is very rich, how can this be too expensive for him to get for you&#34; the salesgirl deadpanned and Layla choked on her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she just say boyfriend? Layla scoffed inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not my..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should get this dress, it will suit you perfectly&#34; the salesgirl interrupted, removing the dress from the rank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can try it on, go on,&#34; the salesgirl insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla chuckled dryly collecting the dress from her. She should just try it on and get done with all of this. Besides the price of the dress is just a few bucks to Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly dashed into the dressing room to get changed and came out afterwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow miss you look so pretty, your boyfriend will never be able to take his eyes off you&#34; the salesgirl fawned admiring the dress on Layla&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look so pretty, it fits perfectly, everything is in the right place&#34; she said and Layla admired the dress also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It really fitted her, bringing out her curves and shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get you a shoe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was about to take a step when she heard someone call her name. She immediately wished it was not the person she thought it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla?&#34; The person called again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla wanted to quickly walk away to avoid her but scarlet was faster as she grabbed Layla&#39;s elbow from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you running to?&#34; She asked with mockery laced in her voice as she turned Layla to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes immediately grew wide when she saw the dress Layla was putting on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted this dress but couldn&#39;t get it because it was too expensive, so Mike told her to get something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So how come a loser like Layla is wearing the dress she badly wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here and why are you wearing this?&#34; She asked in anger. A little surprised to see Layla, she thought Layla ran away from home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go scarlet&#34; Layla says politely and softly not wanting to create a scene here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you ran away from home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t tell me you have decided to come back? Don&#39;t even think of it Layla, father wouldn&#39;t even look at you&#34; she drew out tightening her grip on Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father hates you now, you&#39;re the prodigal daughter who ran away from home after getting pregnant out of wedlock&#34; she said mockingly raising her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla instantly knew what she was trying to do, trash her and talk ill of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t come back Layla, no one wants you, it&#39;s been almost a month and father has forgotten about you, so leave..&#34; she spat scornfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t plan on coming back so let me go&#34; Layla uttered looking around the place if Nolan was nearby. He can&#39;t find out about her pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why are you here? To continue your stupid lifestyle of jumping from one man&#39;s bed to another, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you must have terminated your pregnancy so you can continue with your waywardness, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re still seeing men, that must be how you were able to afford this dress, but guess what?&#34; Scarlet paused as Layla began to struggle with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure to shame you and tell everyone about how deceitful you are, everyone will Shame you once they find out that you killed a child in your womb, just because you want to continue seeing men&#34; Scarlet promised as she began to drag Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla looked around in panic and saw that a few people were already gathering around them. Scarlet was creating a sin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please let me go, I promise to leave immediately and I did not abort any pregnancy, so there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll return home&#34; Layla pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t that make everything better, I&#39;ll take you home and make sure dad marries you off to anyone, you can&#39;t be a disgrace to our family by giving birth out if wedlock&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;ll make sure to give you the disgrace of your life before taking you home&#34; And with that scarlet pushed Layla away, wanting to push her to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her aim was to make a fool of Layla, the dress Layla was wearing was short. So if she falls to the ground her thighs and panties will be exposed in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla tried to regain her footing so she would not fall but couldn&#39;t. She stumbled backwards as she closed her eyes shut waiting for a fall which never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her back landed on something hard as a rock, his intoxicating smell hitting her nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke in a menacing tone as his chest vibrated sending chills down her spine along with everyone else in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell do you think you&#39;re doing!!!?&#34;Layla sighed in exasperation as she quickly wore her clothes, a Jean pant with a tank top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was more than frustrated right at this moment, her problems didn&#39;t seem to be ending, first it was when she broke a very expensive vase, then she had an asthma attack, now Nolan had told her to get dressed that they&#39;ll be visiting a mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to him, he was having a dinner with some clients and she would be like his plus one. That was the main reason he brought her along in the first place, to pose as his date, because since she came here, she had not done anything meaningful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She combed her hair and noticed that it was getting longer. She needed to visit the salon and get her hair done but that will be in New York, not here in Seattle. She can&#39;t afford to come across any one she knows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She packed her hair backwards before coming out of the bathroom to see Nolan waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ready sir&#34; she announced and Nolan stood up from the chair walking straight right out of the door, Layla following suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pick a black dress for her, the one that will suit her perfectly&#34; Nolan instructed the salesgirl on duty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok sir&#34; the sales girl blushed hard. Layla scoffed at the sight of the salesgirl and other breathing female ogling at Nolan. Well she wouldn&#39;t blame them, he was handsome and the clothes he wore made him look more like a high school boy crush not a CEO.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they were busy admiring him, she was busy feeling uneasy as she kept shifting uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This mall is very popular in Seattle, in fact scarlet visited the mall a lot. Layla was scared of meeting her by chance, her step sister tended to blab a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll show you some of our latest designs&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;What!!&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not my..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should get this dress, it will suit you perfectly&#34; the salesgirl interrupted, removing the dress from the rank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can try it on, go on,&#34; the salesgirl insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla chuckled dryly collecting the dress from her. She should just try it on and get done with all of this. Besides the price of the dress is just a few bucks to Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly dashed into the dressing room to get changed and came out afterwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow miss you look so pretty, your boyfriend will never be able to take his eyes off you&#34; the salesgirl fawned admiring the dress on Layla&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look so pretty, it fits perfectly, everything is in the right place&#34; she said and Layla admired the dress also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It really fitted her, bringing out her curves and shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get you a shoe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was about to take a step when she heard someone call her name. She immediately wished it was not the person she thought it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla?&#34; The person called again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla wanted to quickly walk away to avoid her but scarlet was faster as she grabbed Layla&#39;s elbow from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you running to?&#34; She asked with mockery laced in her voice as she turned Layla to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes immediately grew wide when she saw the dress Layla was putting on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted this dress but couldn&#39;t get it because it was too expensive, so Mike told her to get something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So how come a loser like Layla is wearing the dress she badly wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here and why are you wearing this?&#34; She asked in anger. A little surprised to see Layla, she thought Layla ran away from home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go scarlet&#34; Layla says politely and softly not wanting to create a scene here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you ran away from home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t tell me you have decided to come back? Don&#39;t even think of it Layla, father wouldn&#39;t even look at you&#34; she drew out tightening her grip on Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father hates you now, you&#39;re the prodigal daughter who ran away from home after getting pregnant out of wedlock&#34; she said mockingly raising her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla instantly knew what she was trying to do, trash her and talk ill of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t come back Layla, no one wants you, it&#39;s been almost a month and father has forgotten about you, so leave..&#34; she spat scornfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t plan on coming back so let me go&#34; Layla uttered looking around the place if Nolan was nearby. He can&#39;t find out about her pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why are you here? To continue your stupid lifestyle of jumping from one man&#39;s bed to another, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you must have terminated your pregnancy so you can continue with your waywardness, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re still seeing men, that must be how you were able to afford this dress, but guess what?&#34; Scarlet paused as Layla began to struggle with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure to shame you and tell everyone about how deceitful you are, everyone will Shame you once they find out that you killed a child in your womb, just because you want to continue seeing men&#34; Scarlet promised as she began to drag Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla looked around in panic and saw that a few people were already gathering around them. Scarlet was creating a sin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please let me go, I promise to leave immediately and I did not abort any pregnancy, so there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll return home&#34; Layla pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t that make everything better, I&#39;ll take you home and make sure dad marries you off to anyone, you can&#39;t be a disgrace to our family by giving birth out if wedlock&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;ll make sure to give you the disgrace of your life before taking you home&#34; And with that scarlet pushed Layla away, wanting to push her to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her aim was to make a fool of Layla, the dress Layla was wearing was short. So if she falls to the ground her thighs and panties will be exposed in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla tried to regain her footing so she would not fall but couldn&#39;t. She stumbled backwards as she closed her eyes shut waiting for a fall which never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her back landed on something hard as a rock, his intoxicating smell hitting her nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke in a menacing tone as his chest vibrated sending chills down her spine along with everyone else in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell do you think you&#39;re doing!!!?&#34;</p>
