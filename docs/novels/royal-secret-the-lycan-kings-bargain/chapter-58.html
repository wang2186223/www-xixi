                <p>Layla laid on her bed as she stared quietly at the ceiling. Nolan&#39;s place was like a hellhole for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not free to do whatever she wanted. The only time she left the house was when she was going out to work as she was scared to go elsewhere in fear that she might not meet the curfew time he had set for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she thought it would be best if she just stayed at home whenever she was free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her driving lessons took place right in Nolan&#39;s compound, as he arranged for someone to teach her how to drive. She started the day before and just finished taking driving lessons. So far she&#39;s good, things were going well in that perspective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for work it seemed as if she had become the talk of the office because of her expensive dressing. Something she couldn&#39;t help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she refuses to wear the clothes Nolan had bought for her then she would be moving around naked. So she had no choice but to wear whatever he bought for her and there were super expensive clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tossed around the bed yawning loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;F*ck..&#34; she mumbled. It was so boring without Aurora around. She was the only one left in this house as her only company was Maddox. Who over the week she has been trying to overcome her fear for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was harmless like Nolan said and hardly spared her a glance. All she did was watch whenever Nolan was feeding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still staring at the ceiling when her phone vibrated on the bed, she quickly got up to see who the caller was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regan..&#34; she mumbled picking up the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Regan&#34; she smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey shortie&#34; he gesticulated at the other side of the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you doing?&#34; Layla asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m good. I went to your place yesterday. Aurora told me you moved..&#34; he informed as Layla mouthed an OH.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I did..&#34; she confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you faring over there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m good..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s meet Layla..&#34; he requested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meet, now?&#34; Layla exclaimed, her eyes wide open like saucers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes now. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re busy because today is Sunday and I know you&#39;re free. So let&#39;s meet..&#34; he requested as Layla gulped loudly thinking hard on what to tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can make it&#34; she drew out, picking her words carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Layla, don&#39;t turn me down..&#34; he really wanted to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them had lived away from each other for years because he had to relocate with his family to New York.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she was in New York it&#39;s only normal that they spent some more time together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Layla, I promised to show you around New York. How would that be possible if you turned me down, so please..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright I&#39;ll come&#34; Layla finally accepted as she checked what the time was and saw that it was just 1pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; It&#39;s not bad if I go out, &#39; she reasoned as she pursed her lips. Nolan never told her that she can&#39;t go out. He only set out a curfew for her. So when she leaves she had to be back before 7pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll meet you at the cafe opposite pole street&#34; he says and with that he disconnected the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla jumped out of the bed as she ran to her closet to change into something better. She picked out a top with pants before dashing to the bathroom to have a quick shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow Regan, this is really nice!&#34; Layla confessed taking the ice cream cone in her mouth again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really had a great time today thanks to Regan&#39;s company. He took her out to see the movies and also showed her some parts of New York.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know right, I told you the ice cream here is the best..&#34; he smiled and Layla shook her head in support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want another?&#34; He asked but she waved him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still have a lot of things to try so I don&#39;t want to get full..&#34; she said, taking the last piece of the ice cream in her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked what the time was and saw that it was just 3:30pm. She had planned to leave by 6pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright come on, let us try the claw machine, I&#39;ll get you a stuffed animal&#34; he announced as held her hand leading her to where the claw machine was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you do this?&#34; She grinned as he reached out forward the controller after dropping a coin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a pro..&#34; he boasted as his lips curved up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve got, pro..&#34; Layla micmicked, slapping his shoulders lightly as they both laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got it, I&#39;ve got one!!&#34; He announced happily as he finally trapped a stuffed animal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gently, gently..&#34; Layla whispered gingerly to his ears as he focused his attention on the trapped stuffed animal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gently..&#34; she whispered again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it, it tickles..&#34; she laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Layla raised a brow at him as she playfully blew a hair in his ear which got him distracted and he accidentally released the stuffed animal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no Layla, look what you&#39;ve done..&#34; he groaned, running his hands through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have I done?&#34; She laughed wholeheartedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cheated!!&#34; He accused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I did not!!&#34; She defended herself, still laughing loudly and Regan just kept looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow Layla..&#34; he shook his head as he smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the first time I&#39;m seeing you smile genuinely since you came to New York..&#34; he voiced out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was always moody and hardly smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had such a bright and radiant smile that made her look much more pretty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should laugh more often..&#34; he advised diverting his attention to the claw machine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get you a toy shortie..&#34; he teased, reaching out for the controller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Did I ruin the mood?&#34; He raised a brow on seeing that she was no longer smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No..&#34; Layla shook her head refuting his claim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, tell me the truth?&#34; He pestered nudging her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you didn&#39;t, but you will if you don&#39;t get me a stuffed animal..&#34; she pouted, crossing her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right then, stuffed animal it is..&#34; Regan clapped his hands together and he tried reaching for a stuffed animal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God, you got it!!&#34; Layla exclaimed, jumping happily as she hugged Regan who was holding a dog toy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes we did it..&#34; they both clapped their hands happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And this is for you..&#34; he handed over the toy to get in curtsey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks..&#34; she appreciated admiring her new found friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like it a lot..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you do..&#34; he patted her head playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come let&#39;s get something else..&#34; he held a happy Layla&#39;s hand as he led her to another section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla followed him gingerly. This was actually the first time she was having such great fun here in New York.</p>
