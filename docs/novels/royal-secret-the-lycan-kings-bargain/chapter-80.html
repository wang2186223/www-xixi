                <p>Layla walked alongside Nolan as they both left for home. On their way to the elevator, he suddenly asked a shocking question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you take birth control pills?&#34; Layla froze in the spot as her heart stopped working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was he sprouting out of his mouth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Birth control what?&#34; She stammered in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pills..&#34; he completed as they stepped into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, I don&#39;t take them, why are you asking?&#34; she grilled curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you can start taking them,&#34; he replied curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a lot of things to settle and being a father was not one of them, at least not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;II..&#34; Layla&#39;s voice trailed as she was completely out of words. If she was hearing right, this was Nolan telling her to start taking birth control pills, for what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she wouldn&#39;t get pregnant? But she already was!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t want to be a father?&#34; She drew out word by word as he abruptly turned to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No..&#34; he responded. &#34;And don&#39;t even think of getting pregnant..&#34; he warned as Layla breathed hitched. She was just planning a while ago to tell him about the baby but here he was warning her not to get pregnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who in the world doesn&#39;t want a child?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the freaking hell was going on in that head of his? She asked herself in horror. Now she was doomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if I&#39;m already pregnant?&#34; She questioned wanting to hear an answer from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you pregnant?&#34; He asked, fixing his eyes on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Layla bluntly denied. What was she even thinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, it should remain that way for now, hmm&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if it just happened, what would you do about it?&#34; She asked and when she sensed him staring at her suspiciously she quickly changed her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just saying, you know accidents do happen sometimes, it takes us unaware..&#34; she uttered, chuckling sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what would you do if that happened?&#34; She asked, waiting anxiously for his reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was quiet for a long time as he thought hard on the right answer to give, what would really be his reaction if she ended up being pregnant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking of pregnancy, there was something suspicious about her recently that he just couldn&#39;t place his hands on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll&#34; he was about to give his reply when the elevator door opened wide and the next thing they heard was his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan!!&#34; Carla exclaimed in surprise, she had been waiting for him by the elevator door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla..&#34; her face suddenly turned sour the moment she saw Layla beside Nolan. What was she doing there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you say no one could come in, these men literally embarrassed me and stopped me from going in..&#34; she began to complain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have stayed put when they asked you to..&#34; he said calmly as he stepped out with Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Xander?&#34; Nolan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s over there&#34; she pointed at a direction and Nolan headed towards the direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was about to leave also when Carla suddenly dragged her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were you doing in there with Nolan?&#34; She asked venomously, tightening her grip on Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Layla&#39;s brows furrowed. &#34;You&#39;re hurting me Carla, let go..&#34; she whimpered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh..&#34; Carla muttered as she slowly let go off Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were you doing inside with Nolan?&#34; She asked again with a softer tone. She held back her anger for Layla and tried to be nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ask him yourself!&#34; Layla uttered as she walked away. She wondered what sort of a stupid question was that? Carla seemed like she wanted to know about everything going on in her life with Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;F*ck&#34; Carla cursed, stomping her feet to where Layla, Xander and Nolan were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened again?&#34; She asked insistently. She wanted to know why Layla was alone with Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is it any of your business Carla?&#34; Nolan asked, turning to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just that I&#39;m very curious to know, I&#39;ve been waiting for hours you know. I should know what happened..&#34; she stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop crossing your limits Carla&#34; Nolan warned. She still hadn&#39;t given him a good explanation for destroying his reports. They&#39;d definitely get to that issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34; she began but was cut short by Xander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s your car key Nolan..&#34; he handed over the key to Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm Nolan..&#34; Carla held his arm to stop him from leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Can I sleep over at your place?&#34; She requested as Xander and Layla instantly fixed their eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What sort of a request was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have an apartment..&#34; Nolan reminded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I do, but my car broke down and I need a place to crash for the night. I promise you it&#39;s just tonight..&#34; she pleaded with Nolan who hesitantly agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks so much Nolan..&#34; She hugged him happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you too Layla. Please don&#39;t feel uncomfortable with me. It&#39;s just tonight &#34; she forced out a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing..&#34; Layla said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay bye..&#34; she waved, running after Nolan who was already going to his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to follow Nolan?&#34; Xander asked, seeing that Layla was not following Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No..&#34; Layla replied as Xander walked her outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; He queried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well..&#34; she began taking a deep breath. Since Xander already knew her secret there was nothing more to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We come to work separately and live separately..&#34; she replied, forcing out a face smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s late. How can Nolan let you go home all by yourself and in your condition&#34; he protested, that was an irrational thing to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry I&#39;m fine, I&#39;ll use a taxi..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan come on let&#39;s go it&#39;s late!&#34; Carla called out, she was seated at the front seat of Nolan&#39;s car. While Nolan just stood at the door staring in a particular direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was watching Layla, she was obviously sticking to the rule of going to work and returning separately. It was already late and it felt ridiculous to leave her all by herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla..&#34; he called for her as Layla tilted her head towards his direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need anything?&#34; She inquired about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get into the car&#34;</p>
