                <p>Regan pulled up in front of a tall and big company. According to what Aurora had told Layla, Raleigh company was located in different parts of the world, but the headquarters were right here in New York.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here we are, shortie,&#34; Regan said as Layla stared at the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for everything,&#34; Layla appreciated, alighting from the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome. Enjoy your first day at work,&#34; he waved as Layla closed the door shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will. Bye,&#34; she waved as she watched him drive away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regan had told her everything she needed to know when they were driving here. She had been appointed as a secretary. According to him, she was very lucky she got the job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right,&#34; Layla took in a deep breath, taking a look at herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here I come,&#34; she whispered to herself, walking towards the entrance of the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Entering the company, she met a woman with blonde straight hair at the reception area. Beside her was another lady who was on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; Layla muttered nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, how can I help you?&#34; The lady asked politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Layla Marko&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla Markos, right?&#34; She interrupted with a question as Layla shook her head slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Layla mouthed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be the new secretary?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me, please,&#34; she instructed with a smile, walking out from behind the reception table. Layla followed her closely towards the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re late,&#34; she voiced out as they both walked into the elevator while the lady pressed the button with twenty-nine written on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;II&#34; Layla stammered, looking for a reasonable excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay. Don&#39;t sweat yourself,&#34; she chimed in sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just make sure to be punctual from now on, and I&#39;m sure Mr. Alden might take it lenient with you since it&#39;s your first day,&#34; she said, and all Layla could do was nod her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Xander will see you through all that you need to know, so you&#39;re in good hands,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And also, there are basic rules you need to follow. I won&#39;t have the time to tell you everything, but I&#39;ll give you the basics,&#34; she stated, and Layla indicated that she was listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll be working as the president&#39;s secretary. There are only two things I can tell you. One, don&#39;t look into his eyes, ever,&#34; she warned in a cold voice, which made Layla flinch. Well, she didn&#39;t come here to look into people&#39;s eyes; she came here to work. She can do just fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And lastly, maintain a good distance. In conclusion, don&#39;t get on his bad side, if you want to last long here,&#34; the elevator made a ding sound, indicating they had reached their destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out of the elevator, Layla walked behind the woman as she led her through the hallways. From Layla&#39;s conclusion, whoever the president was, she needed to avoid him. From the way the lady spoke, it seemed as if he was highly feared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me,&#34; Layla began, curious to ask a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, any question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, what did you mean by &#39;if I want to last long here&#39;? It&#39;s kind of confusing,&#34; Layla chuckled sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lady stopped in her tracks, Layla doing the same immediately. She turned to face Layla with a grim expression on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s simple. It&#39;s because none of the secretaries who have worked under the president have ever lasted a month. The highest is a month and a week,&#34; she explained, and Layla found herself gulping loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why?&#34; She stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because they made mistakes,&#34; she responded, turning away from Layla as she continued working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of mistakes, I might as well know them so I can avoid it in the future,&#34; Layla requested. The last thing she wants is to lose this job; the pay is really nice, and she doesn&#39;t want Regan to go through the trouble of finding her another job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First of all, he hates lateness. Second, the president is easily paranoid, so any slight mistake, you&#39;re out,&#34; she replied, and Layla found herself chuckling in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And my name is Bertha,&#34; she introduced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here,&#34; Bertha announced as they stopped right in front of a door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your office,&#34; she informed, opening the door as they both stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the president&#39;s office is on the right,&#34; she informed as Layla carefully noted everything down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Xander will be here any minute to guide you because you&#39;re starting work immediately. Seeing the last secretary just got fired, trust me, a lot of work is waiting for you,&#34; she said as Layla smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can handle that,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems like you fear the president a lot,&#34; Layla reasoned. From the way she spoke, one could easily tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone fears him,&#34; Bertha replied. Almost immediately, the door sprang open, and two men walked in. Bertha immediately bowed her head slightly when she saw them, but Layla found herself staring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two incredibly good-looking men. The man in the brown suit, brown hair, brown eyes, was exceptionally cute and looked nice, but the man beside him screamed dominance and had this dangerous aura emanating from him. He looked  like a bad boy, the one most parents would warn their children to stay away from. She unconsciously looked at his eyes and froze when she saw his icy blue eyes staring directly and dangerously at her. Bertha kept tugging Layla&#39;s shirt, trying to tell her to look away, but Layla couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His icy blue eyes looked so familiar, very much familiar. And if her memories were not failing her, his face was familiar. Then she realized who he was; he was the man from that night, the one she&#39;s pregnant for. Layla wanted to scream, but no words came out from her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt his hard gaze on her as he clenched his fist; he looked as if he was going to pounce on her. Then he growled in anger, the type of growl that made both Layla and Bertha flinch in fear. Then his loud voice thundered in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you doing here!?&#34;</p>
