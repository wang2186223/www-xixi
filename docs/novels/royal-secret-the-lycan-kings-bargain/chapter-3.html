                <p>Layla strode into the open-air bar, filled with so many people that it was easy to get lost in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla walked to the bar counter and ordered drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bar attendant served her, and as soon as she gulped down a glass, she scrunched her face in response to the taste hitting her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time she had tasted alcohol, but Layla hesitated as memories of Mike and Scarlett kept surfacing in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around the bar and found ladies dressed in perfumed clothes and revealing attire, chatting gingerly as they all enjoyed themselves and looked like they were having fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, none of this excitement mattered to Layla; she felt as good as dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gulped down another shot, gasping heavily. Why was life so cruel to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey there,&#34; a husky, intimidating voice rang in her ears as she swayed her eyes towards the direction the voice came from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; she waved in a melancholic voice. Anyone seeing her in her current state would have thought that she was going to be executed anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Care for a drink?&#34; the stranger offered as Layla gazed at him for a long time, taking her time to study his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like a very tall man with an imposing demeanor, his features were unique and attractive, with a beautiful pair of blue eyes. Layla fell for his beautiful eyes the moment she saw them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thank you,&#34; Layla replied bluntly, averting her gaze from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must tell you, you look sad. You don&#39;t mind sharing, do you?&#34; he spoke elegantly, twirling the glass of beer as he took slow sips from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None of your business,&#34; Layla spat, cursing herself inwardly. Was she looking so worthless now that even a stranger would recognize it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you really look like you could use a friend,&#34; he reasoned as Layla stared blankly at him, grunting in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, a stranger can even tell how pathetic I look now. If you must know, I&#39;m just the by-product of an affair that was never meant to happen. I&#39;m nothing but a mistake,&#34; Layla uttered, gulping down another glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not useless,&#34; he told her, staring deep into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, that&#39;s if you don&#39;t want to be,&#34; he stated, looking away from her as Layla scoffed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you&#39;re only saying that because you know nothing about me. So, if you should know, I&#39;m the by-product as a result of my father cheating on my stepmom with my mother, who&#39;s a mistress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, that&#39;s your father&#39;s cross to bear. You were not even born or conceived when they committed the act,&#34; the stranger reasoned as Layla sighed heavily. If only Rosalie could see things like that, it was never her fault that she was born.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If only they could see things like that. Do you know what?&#34; Layla asked, turning to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I caught my sister, who has been so kind to me all these years, sleeping with my boyfriend, who also cared very much about me. I&#39;m not sure you know how that hurts. My stepmother&#39;s maltreatment is even better than this. Do you know how it feels to be betrayed by the people you love?&#34; Layla concluded by throwing a question at him, who just remained quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Of course, he has never been betrayed,&#39; Layla thought, returning to her drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I have. Everyone has their own ugly past; we all do,&#34; he said with a sly smile on his face, watching the girl getting drunk in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re drinking too much already?&#34; he asked as she shot daggers at him, her cheeks already slightly flushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why I came here to get drunk and have fun,&#34; Layla answered as she gazed at him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something struck her the moment she mentioned fun; she studied the stranger beside her, the man she had been engaging in a conversation with. He was very good-looking, even more than her so-called boyfriend Mike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among all the handsome men Layla has met in her life, this one stood out. And he&#39;s going to be the best candidate she&#39;ll need; she needed to get back at Mike and Scarlett for the terrible thing they did to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man&#39;s blue eyes said it all; she didn&#39;t even know his name or where he came from because she&#39;s never seen this person in Seattle before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, what&#39;s your name and where are you from?&#34; Layla grilled, trying to know more about the mysterious man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not based here; I came over for a business trip,&#34; came his curt reply as he stared at Layla, sending chills down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t have to know my name, do you?&#34; he questioned indistinctly, moving closer to Layla, making her gulp in discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll call you Mr. Blue Eyes, then, hmm?&#34; proposed Layla as the strange man nodded in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, introductions are over; now let&#39;s go straight to the point. Do you want to hook up?&#34; Layla inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; the man answered without delay, a hint of mischief flashing past his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla gulped loudly; she never expected him to agree so soon, but she had already ventured down this path, and there was no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Mr. Blue Eyes was not from Seattle, it made things a lot easier; after tonight, they&#39;ll go their separate ways and forget if anything ever happened between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, we&#39;ll book a room, but mind you, this is my first time, and I have no experience,&#34; Layla informed beforehand since she heard the first time was usually painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s pupils shrunk as a stream of heat hit him, washing over him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here,&#34; he ordered, his voice already slightly hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla&#39;s heart was in panic, but she had to be bold and get done with it. She walked up to him, putting on an exciting expression; she lifted his chin up, lifting it gently as she placed a light kiss on his lips, amusing the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What a brave girl,&#39; he thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your lips are very soft, and I love your eyes,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla took in heavy breaths as the man carried her tenderly to the bed, he gently placed her on the bed and laid beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel his breath on her and it reeked of alcohol, they were both drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both locked eyes with each other and Layla was enthralled by his gaze and it felt as if she was melting in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dim light of the moonlight allowed her to slightly see his face and it reeked of hunger, sexual hunger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ran his thick hands through her body, eliciting soft and sensual moans from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes bored into hers and she could see that he clearly desired her, the desire to dominate her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla didn&#39;t want to surrender to him, she shouldn&#39;t be doing this, he was a total stranger and he also held this dangerous Aura around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to give her virginity to someone that she didn&#39;t even know his name but the more she tried to resist, the more she fell for his charms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Electricity seemed to pass through her body sending a jolt right to already wet folds as he ran his hands through her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stream of intense pleasure washed through her and soon they began to kiss each other savagely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled off her gown with speed and she gasped in anticipation of what was to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla gasped sharply as pains and pleasure balled together and pierced her soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was such an incredible feeling that she got lost in the myriad of emotions that swirled through her, with each passing second the pain subdued and the pleasure so intense that she thought she would pass out.</p>
