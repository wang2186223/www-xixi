                <p>Layla sat on the couch staring at the ceiling of the quiet hotel room. Nolan was not around. He left, saying he had something to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left five hours ago and that has been the best moments for Layla, she did not feel insecure with him around and there was no Nolan to yell at her or even scold her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to his words the hotel room was very big and spacious that they could live inside like none of the other even existed.</p>

                <p>After that, she had a quick shower before Nolan would arrive then she had lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered where he must have gone that made him spend such a long time there but she did not care, he can spend eternity if he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla took a look at her phone and saw that it was almost evening, she would have loved to sleep but she did not want him to walk in and see her sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still staring lifelessly at the ceiling when the door sprang open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir!!&#34; She bolted up from the chair the moment she saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked right in ignoring as he went straight into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh gosh, why is he back so soon?&#34; Layla breathed out in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit, he&#39;s so cold and intimidating&#34; she said again pacing around the room as she found it hard to calm down with him around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s no way she&#39;s going to sleep tonight, no fucking way!! Not with Nolan here, she would just melt out of nervousness and intimidation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was still pacing around the room restlessly when she unconsciously stumbled upon the table at the center of the room, in a bid to save herself from falling, she accidentally pushed a vase and it fell to the ground shattering to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no!!&#34; Layla gasped in panic seeing the shredded glass pieces on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was in a very big trouble, not only in the hands of Nolan but the hotel as a whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she lived in Seattle, she heard a lot of stories about this hotel, it was a five star hotel and the people who mostly lodged here were business men who came on business trips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To book a room here was hella expensive, not to talk of a golden suite now she has destroyed a valuable here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her salary for a year would not be able to pay for this, where will she start from?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was still panting in fear when Nolan stepped out of the bathroom. He had already freshened up and was dressed in casual clothes, a sweater and joggers, all blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a towel on his hand which he used in drying his wet hair, all in all, he looked breathtaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan saw the panic In Layla&#39;s eyes and his eyes darted to the ground where he saw the mess she had created.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir I&#39;m so sorry, it was an..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut your mouth up!!&#34; He snarled and Layla flinched backwards in fright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you know the gravity of what you&#39;ve just done?&#34; He questioned abd Layla shook her head slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how much this is worth right?&#34; He asked again and Layla shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was an accident sir, I&#39;ll pay for it&#34; she stammered, cursing at herself inwardly. She had no freaking money to pay for a hotel vase which is very expensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll pay for it?&#34; Nolan chuckled dryly and the chuckle that ghosted his face was immediately replaced by a grim expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your networth would not even be able to book a room here not to talk of paying for this, you know right?&#34; Layla swallowed deep as he said those words to her. His words hurt her so much, but she just had to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not a fucking child Layla, you&#39;re a damn grownup, fuck!!&#34; He deadpanned throwing the towel he was holding on the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you can keep on making stupid mistakes that can never be fixed, right?&#34; He spat scornfully and all Layla could do was fixed her eyes in the ground fighting the tears that were threatening to fall out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just as useless as I thought &#34; he stated and a tear dropped from Layla&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time a person called her useless was about three weeks ago, when she was still here in Seattle. When she lived with her stepmother Rosalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosalie always referred to her as useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not useless&#34; she whispered softly but Nolan heard her as he scoffed and said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then prove that fact and stop acting like a mistake&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of my sight &#34; he added as he did not want to spend another second with her. Her clumsiness irritated him a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla wiped a tear ball from her eyes and she rushed into the bathroom trying so hard not to burst into tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn you!&#34; Nolan cursed reaching out for a telephone wanting to reach out for a waiter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come to room 410&#34; he requested dropping the telephone nosily afterwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About a few minutes later, a knock came through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on&#34; a waiter walked in and Nolan pointed at the broken glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clean this mess and give me the bill for a replacement&#34; he ordered sitting on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla is his responsibility as long as he was the one that brought her here and he knew that she would never be able to pay for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay sir, I&#39;ll be back&#34; the waiter bowed before walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan sat patiently waiting for the waiter to come back when Layla crossed his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was exceptionally quiet same with the bathroom, it was like a soul was not even in the room except from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He has heightened senses and would definitely be able to here someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly became alerted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if she had done something to harm herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla&#34; he called walking over to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door slowly to see if anything was wrong with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pupils dilated immediately he saw her as he was encompassed with horror.</p>
