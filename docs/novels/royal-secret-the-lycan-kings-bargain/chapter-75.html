                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s it, hold on, I&#39;m coming!&#34; Aurora yelled as she ran out of her room. It was just 9pm so she wondered who was knocking at her door, knowing there was no way it could be Layla as Layla was at work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morn.oh Fuck!&#34; Her countenance fell the moment she saw the person standing on her porch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; She asked coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came here to see you, why else would I be here?&#34; Xander responded pointing out the obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you&#39;ve seen me, leave..&#34; She made her way to shut the door but was stopped by Xander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I also came to talk to you about something, so I&#39;m coming in..&#34; he smirked as he walked straight into her apartment as he sat on the couch comfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never invited you in!&#34; Aurora snapped at him as he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chill Aurora, stop getting worked up already..&#34; Xander said as if he was bored of her attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you being here is getting me so worked up that I feel like strangling you, so leave!&#34; She ordered pointing at her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came here because of Layla, not you so chill..&#34; he intoned as Aurora eyed him suspiciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Layla?&#34; She questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know she&#39;s pregnant right?&#34; Xander asked as Aurora stilled. She thought Layla wanted to keep it a secret, then how did this scumbag know about it. Aurora reasoned to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ask her yourself..&#34; she spat at him distastefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m only here because you&#39;re best friends and you might have the answer to what I want&#34; he informed. Layla was so lucky that Nolan had asked him instead to run a background check on Layla because if it was someone else, no doubt Nolan would have found out about her pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was told to run a background check on her and I&#39;m doing so..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you ask Layla yourself or rather go run your background check somewhere else. Leave my house..&#34; she said venomously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the only friend Layla has&#34; he pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regan and Aurora were the only friends Layla had, he would have gone to Regan to ask for an answer instead of coming here but he felt it would be better if he asked Aurora instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha ha ha, I&#39;m so lucky. Leave!&#34; She voiced out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you must know, Layla told me about her secret herself and begged me not to tell Nolan which is a very hard thing for me to do&#34; he confessed. He was Nolan&#39;s Gamma and had never lied or hidden something from him, especially something as crucial as this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was out doing Layla a favor by hiding her secret and because he also respected her a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla told you?&#34; Aurora asked with squinted eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why would Layla do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It just happened, now you&#39;re going to tell me everything that happened to her in Seattle and why she moved to New York&#34; he requested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want to know Xander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That Layla is suffering and still keeps quiet about it, if you&#39;re so eager to know then let me tell you..&#34; she said, taking her seat as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla lost her mom when she was still very little, after that her dad took her in. It happened that Layla&#39;s father Markos already had a wife at home, which is Rosalie and Rosalie has a daughter, who is scarlet..&#34; she began. She was only doing this as a means to help Layla. It was best for everyone that Nolan knew the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scarlet&#34; He muttered, that was the lady that showed up in the company and was hellbent on humiliating Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right from the moment Layla stepped her foot into that house Rosalie had never been kind to her. She always treated her badly, starved her, made her do all manner of hard work while her daughter lived like a princess. Back then we were still in high school. I was the only friend Layla had and I knew how hurt she was then&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As time went on, we graduated from college. After graduation Layla&#39;s father was diagnosed with a kidney stone and needed a transplant. Layla worked so hard to find the perfect match for her dad. And when she finally did Rosalie locked her up and took her daughter to the hospital instead so she could frame scarlet as the perfect daughter&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To cut the long story short, Layla caught her boyfriend banging Mike, then she went to a bar and got drunk, you know what happened next. Weeks later she discovered that she was pregnant, in fear of Rosalie hurting her daughter, she left home and came to New York to start a new life..&#34; she paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you helped her to get a job, she resumes work and sees that the father of her child is her boss who&#39;s very cruel to her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what, Layla fears that man a lot that she can&#39;t even bring herself to tell him about her pregnancy. I&#39;ve tried convincing her several times to tell him but she&#39;s just too scared and then he keeps bombarding her with lots of work. Now the doctor has warned Layla to stay away from too much work because there&#39;s a risk of her having a miscarriage..&#34; Aurora concluded. &#34;You&#39;ve heard what you wanted to hear, now leave..&#34; she waved him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A miscarriage?&#34; Xander asked with narrowed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the life of her child is In danger and Layla is just so stubborn. I&#39;ve told her before it&#39;s either she quits or says the truth but she wants none. I really can&#39;t understand her sometimes..&#34; Aurora said, shaking her head. Layla kept making things difficult for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can&#39;t quit..&#34; Xander mumbled. Layla and Nolan were mates; there&#39;s no way she could quit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what, Layla is such a kind lady and she honestly deserves someone who would care for her. That lady has been through a lot, so please help me beg your boss to take it easy with her, thank you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for telling me this Aurora..&#34; he thanked her sincerely as he stood up from the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome, leave!&#34; She uttered In sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bye sunshine, see you some other time &#34; he winked at her as he made his way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he knew about everything that was going on, he needed to do something about it or things could get messy.</p>
