                <p>Carla walked majestically into Nolan&#39;s company as she made way for his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to get into the elevator when two bodyguards placed there stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; She asked in anger as she took off the shades she was wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not allowed to go in, miss..&#34; the first bodyguard named James said in a stern voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were given strict orders not to allow anyone In.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me..&#34; Carla chuckled as she slowly placed her shades into her purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know who I am?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Carla and once Nolan finds out about this. I&#39;ll make sure he fires you both. So get out of my way to avoid that!&#34; She howerled moving close to the elevator but James pushed her backwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re only obeying strict orders..&#34; she says curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost it? Do you seriously know who you&#39;re talking to? Get out of my way now!&#34; She gritted her teeth in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came here in hopes of seeing Nolan and spending some time with him after what she did to the reports she was sure Nolan would be very pissed at Layla, that&#39;s why she came here with a plan and now these men were telling her rubbish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me in.&#34; She requested trying to contain their anger but from the look in the men&#39;s faces, they would not allow her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were werewolves so there was no way she would be able to fight them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you know how important I am to the pack and to Nolan? Just you wait I&#39;ll make sure you pay for this&#39; &#39; she promised them bringing out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to call Nolan now..&#34; she dialed Nolan&#39;s number but got no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;s Nolan not answering his call..&#34; she muttered calling him for the second time, then the third time and the fourth but got no response either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on inside that I can&#39;t go in?&#34; She asked feeling anger bubble up within her, Nolan just ignored her calls and she was being humiliated here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one is allowed to go in..&#34; James said with a note of finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been warned squarely not to allow anyone in and Xander specially warned him about that. Even if it was someone very important, they were not allowed to go in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;F*ck you!!!&#34; She cursed at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of my way!!&#34; She yelled struggling with them but they only held her back preventing her from going in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is Nolan doing inside?&#34; She asked no one in particular as she arranged her hair that has been ruffled due to struggling with James.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was evening already and time for him to get off work and that&#39;s why she came here to follow him home but here they were preventing her from going in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir..&#34; she heard James speak through an air pod that was placed in his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A woman is trying to get in despite your others , she&#39;s creating a scene..&#34; he informed as Carla became intrigued to know about the person he called. What was Nolan&#39;s reason for saying no one should come in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;you&#39;ll definitely pay for this&#34; she swore with a menacing look on her face. Now she was so very angry. Why would Nolan issue a lock down when almost all the staff were already gone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me in!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Must you always create a ruckus out of everything Carla?&#34; Xander asked disdainfully as he approached them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xander, tell this man to get out of my way right now?&#34; She requested pointing at James and the other man beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you&#39;re not allowed to go in&#34; Xander affirmed in a cold tone as Carla scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you are you to say that huh?&#34; She yelled at the top of her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As the person in charge..&#34; he responded. He always knew Carla had a thing for Nolan and was trying to get his attention though Nolan never looked at her in that perspective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was against them ever getting together as Carla would never be the right person for Nolan. Layla was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As a gamma who runs around Nolan as a puppet, get a life Xander..&#34; she mocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you seriously hear yourself Carla?&#34; He raised a brow at her. She has always been stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Puppet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a role Carla, I&#39;m the Alpha&#39;s gamma and the person who can stand for him whenever he&#39;s busy, just like now. What about you ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just a shameless she wolf Omega who goes about fangirling over a man that will never notice her&#34; he fired at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was what she was an Omega, the lowest ranks of Lycans and werewolves. She was only where she was today because of the deed her father had done for Nolan during the war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say?&#34; She asked fuming in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure that you&#39;re not deaf and can hear perfectly well&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s either you wait till Nolan comes out or you get out!&#34; He stated. Xander was very friendly to everyone. But Carla was someone he just couldn&#39;t vibe with. He didn&#39;t like her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going in, you can say whatever you want..&#34; Carla said making way to go in but was stopped by James once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t try anything stupid Carla and if she insists on going in, throw her out of this place..&#34; he instructed before walking out on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xander you can&#39;t do this!!&#34; Carla screamed after him as he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xander, come back here!&#34; She yelled in anger but he ignored her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xander!!&#34; She called at the top of her voice but not once did he answer her as he disappeared from sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to face the bodyguards in frustration but they held a passive look on their face. She would never get in no matter how hard she tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just you wait for Nolan, I&#39;ll make sure you lose your job&#34; she threatened as she went to sit at a nearby chair. She was going to wait till Nolan came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He he he (⁠•⁠‿⁠•⁠). Finally done with this chapter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope you&#39;re enjoying the book so far my lovely readers and what do you think about Xander putting Carla in her place?</p>
