                <p>Belching sounds were heard as Layla released all the contents in her stomach into the toilet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt like disgorging her lungs out as she felt so irritated and disgusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;F**k&#34; she mumbled feeling satiated. She now felt better. The toilet made a flushing sound as she pressed a button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up from the ground, she walked over to the sink and turned the faucet on. Water began to flow out, which she used in rinsing her face and her mouth.</p>

                <p>&#34;Layla are you okay?&#34; Keisha asked worriedly immediately as she stepped out of the bathroom.</p>

                <p>Truth be told, she was feeling very funny. She guessed it was the normal early morning pregnancy sickness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened, you look sick?&#34; Keisha reasoned, she had noticed Layla&#39;s foul mood, since the first time she stepped foot into the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine&#34; Layla stressed, holding her forehead. Now she was feeling dizzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t look fine to me..&#34; Keisha pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, I&#39;m okay..&#34; Layla forced out a smile to make it look convincing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just that I felt irritated at what happened back there, you know the blood and all, it made me cringe, you know..&#34; she explained as Keisha shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or.&#34; She drew out playfully tugging Layla&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re pregnant..&#34; Keisha winked mischievously and Layla choked on her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What pregnant?&#34; Layla exclaimed in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It just couldn&#39;t be that they knew about her pregnancy. She&#39;s definitely done for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Pregnant right? I&#39;m right, isn&#39;t it?&#34; Keisha smiled and Layla reasoned that maybe she didn&#39;t have any idea about her pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m not pregnant&#34; she denied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can I get pregnant, who will get me pregnant, there&#39;s no way I can get pregnant right?&#34; She laughed sheepishly as she kept on asking countless questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan can get you pregnant..&#34; Keisha voiced out and Layla frowned. It seemed as if the world was against her today. They&#39;re definitely trying to test her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please it&#39;s not that we&#39;re that close, so&#34; she chuckled. Now she really needed to leave this place called a pack and she needed to visit a hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything can happen..&#34; Keisha shrugged her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Nolan would know right away that you&#39;re carrying his baby&#34; Keisha began and Layla felt her heart seized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that a special ability of theirs?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He ca..n?&#34; She stammered and Keisha nodded affirmatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he can know that she&#39;s pregnant, does that mean that he was aware all these while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, when you&#39;re about three or four months gone, he can smell his pup in you..&#34; Keisha explained and Layla found herself breathing in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was only about two months gone, so she was safe now, until she thought of something to do about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you telling me this?&#34; Layla asked Keisha suspiciously, she just brought up the topic of pregnancy and that scared the living hell out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I suspected that you were pregnant for a split second..&#34; she confessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on let&#39;s go meet Nolan, I&#39;ll tell him that you&#39;re feeling sick..&#34; Keisha informed dragging a nervous Layla away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla could tell that Keisha was a very experienced woman. She realized that she couldn&#39;t hide this forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner or later, another month would pass by within the blink of an eye and she would be three months pregnant. Then Nolan would be able to smell his pup according to Keisha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She contemplated on if she should just tell him the truth, but then something within her felt that Nolan wouldn&#39;t believe her and would even hate her more than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He considers their first night a mistake, su anything that results from that night will be a mistake as well, according to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to do something fast, it was either she told him the truth or she just waited till she was three months gone, then he would find out about the truth himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was confused as hell, she needed Aurora, she needed her best friend. She was the best person she could go to for advice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Keisha, can a non human know about this?&#34; She asked out of the blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was referring to Aurora, her best friend was human and she wanted to tell her everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, humans are not supposed to know about us..&#34; she replied and Layla bit her lips in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I know about you and I&#39;m your you know&#34; she muttered. If humans weren&#39;t supposed to know about werewolves, then what was she doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your case is different Layla..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the alpha&#39;s mate, the moon goddess specially chose him for you, so that&#39;s acceptable..&#34; she explained as they walked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, actually I have a best friend and I just thought if I could&#34; she drew out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand your plight Layla, I&#39;d advise you talk to Nolan yourself, he might agree, I can&#39;t give you an answer&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks Keisha, I&#39;ll do that..&#34; Layla appreciated it. Keisha has been nothing but nice to get and she deeply appreciates her kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Nolan?&#34; Keisha asked Carla who was standing in front of a door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s having a meeting with the elders&#34; Carla replied as her countenance fell the moment she saw Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was definitely a mood spoiler. She always ruined her mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has decided not to show her hatred in front of everyone, especially Nolan. But she would definitely get Layla and throw her out of the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s having some rest, he said he needed some quiet time, he is in his study..&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Krishna asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was about to leave, you can leave also, he doesn&#39;t want to see anyone&#34; Carla snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla is not just anyone, she is his mate..&#34; Keisha stressed out and Carla felt her blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And so what?&#34; Carla asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s just a normal mate, so he shouldn&#39;t have some rest because she exists right? He&#39;s busy, leave!&#34; She spat distastefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t want to see anyone..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not Layla, he should know that she&#39;s sick..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who cares, Layla&#39;s not a baby, but an adult, you can take care of yourself right?&#34; She asked, turning to Layla who agreed with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her Keisha, I&#39;m not a baby..&#34; she said. She didn&#39;t want to see Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes you&#39;re a baby, you&#39;re the alpha&#39;s baby, and he&#39;ll take care of you when you&#39;re sick&#34; Keisha said holding Layla&#39;s hand as she made way to knock on the door but was stopped by Carla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m letting you disturb the Alpha..&#34; she defended, spreading her hands wide as if she was protecting the door. To stop them from passing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay Keisha, we can leave..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard her, leave! Go to your mate instead and stop poking your nose in others business..&#34; she chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just go..&#34; Layla was about to leave with Keisha when the door sprang open.</p>
