                <p>Layla typed noisily on her computer as she had a lot of work that had been piled up for her; Nolan had instructed that she finish up before he returned back from his meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still engrossed in her work when she heard some footsteps walking towards her. She lifted her head to see a woman nicely dressed standing before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good day, how can I help you?&#34; Layla asked politely, wondering who the woman might be. As far as she was concerned, she was not an employee here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to see Nolan,&#34; the lady requested, staring intently at Layla, who found her gaze uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The President is currently having a meeting, please wait for him,&#34; she said, returning to her work. Curious to know about the strange lady, from the way she called Nolan, one would think that they were a thing. She never knew that Nolan had a girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; the lady flashed a smile at Layla before going to sit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments later, a male figure walked in, and the lady immediately stood up, rushing to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan,&#34; she called in excitement, and she wrapped her hands around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carla, what are you doing here?&#34; He questioned, pulling Carla away from him as he looked irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to see you, why else will I be here?&#34; She giggled as Nolan began to walk into his office, Carla walking behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla watched them walk into Nolan&#39;s office until the door was shut closed. She snorted in sarcasm, returning to her work. &#39;So he has a girlfriend?&#39; she thought to herself. She felt an unexplainable feeling when she thought about that but decided to brush it off as it was none of her business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>IN NOLAN&#39;S OFFICE</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; Nolan questioned, pulling off his coat as he took his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to see you,&#34; Carla replied, taking her seat as well opposite him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell me you came all the way from the pack to see me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I came to see you, I&#39;ve missed you,&#34; Carla said, and Nolan glanced sideways at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t even call, Nolan. You&#39;ve not been to the pack for three months, and you never called to ask about me, that&#39;s not fair,&#34; she pouted, and she folded her arms across her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was busy,&#34; came his curt reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And it&#39;s not as if I&#39;m obligated to call you,&#34; he added in a cold voice, and Carla&#39;s face fell in disappointment. When was he ever going to look at her? It&#39;s been five years now, and he still fails to notice her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have at least still called,&#34; she mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she braced herself up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The second reason I&#39;m here is to pass some information to you about the pack,&#34; she began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wolfsbane was found in our pipelines, the ones supplying water straight to the pack,&#34; she informed, and Nolan abruptly stopped what he was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is that possible?&#34; He questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know; someone obviously planted it there, but thankfully it was spotted by Darren before it could cause any damage.&#34; Darren was Nolan&#39;s beta and oversaw everything that went on in the pack whenever Nolan was not around, while Xander was his gamma, the one who usually went around with the Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is Darren dealing with it now?&#34; He asked; if there was one thing Nolan cared the most about in his life right now, it was his people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pretty well, we&#39;ve increased the security, and he&#39;s trying to catch the perpetrators,&#34; she responded, fixing her gaze on Nolan, who had a worried look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to worry about anything; we&#39;re dealing quite fine, everyone is safe,&#34; she assured warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go now,&#34; he dismissed her, and Carla&#39;s face wore a state of shock. She&#39;s not even spent up to thirty minutes, and he was dismissing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I just arrived; you should at least treat me to a meal, take me out on a tour and&#34; she listed on, but a glare from Nolan was enough to shut her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been in New York long enough to know around this place; you can get some food on your way back to the pack if you&#39;re hungry,&#34; he said, and Carla bit her lips in anger, trying hard to control her rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I will,&#34; she managed to say through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can inform Darren that I&#39;ll be at the pack tonight to check things out for myself,&#34; he stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really??&#34; Carla exclaimed, as her joy knew no bounds. Nolan is coming to the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need for me to leave now; we can leave together at night,&#34; she suggested, wanting to spend some more time with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can leave; I have something to deal with. I&#39;ll be there at midnight,&#34; he declined, waving her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Nolan; I can wait,&#34; she voiced out, her face beaming with smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave Carla,&#34; he growled at her, and her smile instantly fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave, bye,&#34; she waved sullenly, as she dragged her feet to the door. He didn&#39;t even bother to wave back at her. She would just have to persevere a little more; Nolan will definitely be here; with time, he&#39;ll forget his dead mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped out to see Layla working on some files. Something just didn&#39;t sit well with her about the new secretary, and she didn&#39;t like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, what&#39;s your name?&#34; She asked Layla coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Layla,&#34; Layla responded startled at the way Carla approached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla, Layla,&#34; Carla repeatedly said as she observed Layla. Dark brown straight hair that stopped above her shoulders, brown eyes and overall, cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t think of trying anything with Nolan, or I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to break your bones,&#34; she threatened as Layla stared at her perplexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t get you,&#34; Layla uttered, she can&#39;t just work up to her and begin to threaten her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, you won&#39;t; you will when I catch you trying to seduce Nolan, till then have a good day,&#34; she smiled walking away from Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a delusional woman, I wonder where he picked her from,&#34; Layla shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you feel insecure about your boyfriend, you can as well hold him tight; he probably doesn&#39;t find you attractive,&#34; she mumbled to herself as she tried hard to control her anger; that bitch just made her very angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll break your bones next time instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Break whose bones?&#34; Someone asked from behind her as she turned to see Nolan standing there.</p>
