                <p>A call came through, as Nolan&#39;s phone vibrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He groaned sitting up from the bed, picking up the phone as he took a look at the caller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xander was written at the phone screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talk to me&#34; he voiced out in a low voice as he picked the call up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh thank goodness..&#34; Xander&#39;s relieved voice peered out from the phone speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been trying to reach you a through the night, but you were not picking up, how&#39;s everything over there?&#34; Xander asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good..&#34; came Nolan&#39;s Short reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Layla?&#34; Xander raised his brow waiting for Nolan&#39;s reply. He actually called for two reasons. To ask after them and know if Nolan s rejected Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s fine.&#34; Nolan replied softly and his eyes traveled to Layla who was sleeping soundly beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raked his hands through his hair, as he blew out air from his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday definitely did not go as he had planned..he had planned to reject her but ended up marking her as his instead. Now that were both one, like inseparables. Something he tried so hard to avoid from happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright that&#39;s good to hear&#34; Xander grimned at the other side of the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Hayes?&#34; Nolan asked climbing off the bed as he walked over to his closet to grab some clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He collected a shirt and a shirt which he wore, before leaving the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s been caught, my men caught him when he was trying to flee Seattle&#34; Xander explained as Nolan shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is he right now?&#34; He asked. Now he would show Hayes who the real boss was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re currently at the pack..&#34; replied Xander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll be there soon..&#34; Nolan informed disconnecting the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed deeply looking around the sitting room which was in a huge mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla&#39;s dress was lying helplessly on the floor, her panties also. His clothes too, they were at different sections of the sitting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began to walk around the room, picking up the clog one after the other and he tossed them in a nearby trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God damnit..&#34; he cursed sitting I&#39;m the dining room as she resolved to wait for Layla till she woke up, then they would have a proper conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla rolled in the bed, groaning loudly as she stretched her hands out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her eyes slowly as she looked around the room. She realized she was alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck&#34; she cursed sitting up from the bed as she rested against the headboard and she used the duvet to cover herself up as she was naked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found herself breathing in relief that Nolan was not in the room, because she wasn&#39;t sure that she would ever be able to face him again. Not after what happened last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished that it was all a dream. That it never happened in reality. Now the aphrodisiac hated used on him had worn off. She wondered what would happen next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both had sex with each other because she voluntarily offered herself to him and in the act of doing so, he had marked her. When he clearly stated that he would reject her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla bit her lips in frustration. Things would never remain the same again from now on with him around her, not after what transpired between them last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of last night, Layla&#39;s face burned red as she recollected everything that happened, Nolan was completely different from the Nolan she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Nolan she knew was cold, heartless and didn&#39;t care about anyone&#39;s feelings. The Nolan of last night was surprisingly gentle and sultry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering how hard he went on her, he drove her so hard that she became scared at a point. She was pregnant and didn&#39;t want anything to endanger the life of her baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed Aurora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighting her purse which was lying on the floor, Layla squirmed out of the bed with the duvet wrapping her body as she went over to grab her purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her purse as she brought out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked what time it was and discovered that it was past ten in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night was so tiring and it left her exhausted. She was still sore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over to Nolan&#39;s closet and grabbed some clothes. Thank goodness he had clothes here because she didn&#39;t have any, not even underwear. They&#39;ve been shredded to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After grabbing the clothes, she walked into the bathroom to freshen up, but before that she had to call Aurora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Layla, how are you doing?&#34; Aurora&#39;s cheerful voice rang in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m good&#34; Layla replied in a low voice as she didn&#39;t want Nolan to hear her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how&#39;s your trip going, I hope you haven&#39;t stumbled upon scarlet and her scary mother?&#34; Aurora asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I did. I met scarlet&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!!&#34; Aurora screamed that Layla had to shift her phone a few meters away from her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hope she did not try to do something stupid?&#34; Aurora grilled curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell you about that once I get home, now I have a very important question for you&#34; Layla began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay what question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ummisum..is it safe to have sex during pregnancy?&#34; Layla questioned whispers as she was embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you planning on having sex?&#34; Aurora gasped in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, did you get back with Mike?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!! Eww&#34; Layla frowned in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why are you asking or did you have sex with&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Aurora..&#34;Layla cut her short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop making stupid assumptions, I was just curious that&#39;s all, so I decided to ask..&#34; she lied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to talk to Aurora about Nolan now and all the mysteries surrounding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just give me an answer already?&#34; Layla grilled anxiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay alright, Yes it&#39;s safe..&#34; Aurora finally responded and Layla breathed out in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank God..&#34; she mouthed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla, if you&#39;re planning on having se&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Byeee, see you soon&#34; Layla quickly said as she disconnected the call. She had already gotten her answers, that was one issue solved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she needed to go to the next. Face Nolan.</p>
