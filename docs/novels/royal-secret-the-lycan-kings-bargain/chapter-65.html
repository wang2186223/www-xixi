                <p>Layla stood unmoving as Scarlet ratted out mean things about her. She could do nothing but sob quietly. There was nothing she could do now, her secret was out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xander was Nolan&#39;s Gamma and there was no way he was going to keep this a secret from his Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also had a look of doubt in his eyes because from the way Scarlet spoke, it sounded as if Layla was a loose woman way before she came to New York.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look Miss, that&#39;s enough..&#34; Xander finally butted in as he stood in front of Layla, he had finally had enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Mr. It&#39;s not enough. You don&#39;t know Layla more than I do..&#34; Scarlet scoffed, the fact Xander was supporting Layla despite everything she had said pissed her off the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She expected him to shame Layla also and leave her here but he was doing the complete opposite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look I&#39;m her stepsister, I know her more than anyone&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla got pregnant in Seattle and ran away from home because she couldn&#39;t stand the shame..&#34; she accused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you know what, she has no idea about the father because she got pregnant out of wedlock and why is that. She sleeps around. Trust me Mr, you don&#39;t want to be with a woman who has slept with almost all the men in the world..&#34; Scarlet concluded breathlessly as she fanned herself for breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she has said this, there was no way Xander was going to support Layla, he would definitely shun her. But to Scarlet dismay Xander did none of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be ashamed of yourself..&#34; he fired at Scarlet who stood in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me?&#34; She gave him a questioning gaze as she pointed at herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes you. You should be ashamed of yourself..&#34; he uttered in disbelief. He actually never wanted to say anything in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after hearing what Scarlet had said to Layla and the state Layla was in, he could only say one thing. Scarlet meant no good for Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re such a despicable woman. Why are you so hellbent on shaming your sister&#34; he stormed angrily at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Correction. Step sister..&#34; Scarlet corrected with a sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can not be blood sisters because you can never be as genuine as Layla. Layla Is such a sweet soul and is ten times better than..&#34; he defended Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s she better than me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me!&#34; Scarlet yelled. &#34;She&#39;s only a whore. A whore can never be better than me..&#34; she uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what?&#34; Xander began in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out..&#34; he said out bluntly. At this point, Xander had had enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to stop talking to Layla like that,&#34; he said, his voice stern. &#34;You have no right to judge her or say those things about her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she&#39;s lying. Ask her if she got pregnant out of wedlock!!&#34; Scarlet protested, her voice shrill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just trying to tell the truth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The truth is that you&#39;re being incredibly rude and disrespectful,&#34; Xander said, his patience wearing thin. &#34;I think it&#39;s time for you to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Scarlet spat, crossing her arms defiantly. &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere until I&#39;m done with her,&#34; she insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xander&#39;s eyes narrowed, and he took a step towards Scarlet. &#34;I&#39;m warning you, miss,&#34; he said, his voice low and dangerous. &#34;You need to leave, now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t make me leave!&#34; Scarlet shot back, but there was a note of uncertainty in her voice. She could see that Xander was serious, and she wasn&#39;t sure if she wanted to push him any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m giving you one last chance,&#34; he stated, his tone leaving no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t leave, I&#39;m going to call security.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will do no such thing!&#34; She fired at him. How could he think of calling security on her. The last time at the mall she was utterly embarrassed as she was thrown out like a common thief. Today she would not allow that to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not in a position to tell me what to do&#34; Xander retorted, his voice calm and collected. &#34;You&#39;re clearly not welcome here, and you&#39;re causing a scene. You need to leave before I have to make you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, Layla had had enough. She stepped between them, facing Scarlet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just go, okay?&#34; she muttered, her voice pleading. &#34;Please, just leave and we can forget this ever happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, it looked like Scarlet was going to argue, but then she seemed to deflate. &#34;Fine,&#34; she said, her voice resigned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go, but I promise you, Layla. I&#39;ll get back to you&#34; She swore in a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave but I&#39;ll be back and you..&#34; she snapped, pointing at Xander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be wary of her..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As it turned out, Scarlet didn&#39;t want to be embarrassed again, at least not in a big company, so she began to walk away not after promising Layla that she&#39;d come back for revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla and Xander watched as she left the company premises and then they were left alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry about all that,&#34; Layla apologized, looking down at the floor. He had really helped her to stand up to Scarlet. Because she knew Scarlet tauntings could have gone on till she gathered a crowd around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not your fault,&#34; Xander assured, placing a hand on her shoulder. He only did what was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was the one who caused all the trouble.&#34; Layla looked up at him and she could see the concern in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; he asked, his voice gentle and Layla shook her head slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have this..&#34; he handed his handkerchief over to Layla which she used in drying her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks Xander..&#34; Layla appreciated it. Now Scarlet was fine but not after putting her in hot soup. She knew fully well that she had a lot of explanations to give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come let&#39;s go in..&#34; he led her inside the company and the both began to walk inside when Xander suddenly asked a shocking question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla, are you really pregnant?&#34;</p>
