                <p>Layla and Nolan both engaged In a heart shattering kiss, it was as if they didn&#39;t care about anything that went on in the world at that moment, as they only cared to fulfill each other&#39;s sexual desires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their kiss deepened. Both were kissing each other with savage hunger that their own fears couldn&#39;t seem to extinguish. It was rough and luscious and ruthless. She didn&#39;t know Nolan could be this savage.As he was always cold and unapproachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she liked it. She loved it. The unrestrained and raging Nolan was so irresistibly seductive. And she wanted him even more. Every side of him, gentle or ferocious, she wanted it all. She wanted all of him right at the moment and didn&#39;t care about anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing Layla was certain of, was that she wanted him so badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Nolan, she moaned against his lips. She immediately clasped her mouth shut when she called him that, she just called him by his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so..&#34; she began to apologize as she pulled away from the kiss, but Nolan stopped her as she nudged her closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can say my name baby..&#34; his deep seductive voice rang in her ears and he kissed her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh goddid he just call her baby?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And why did it sound so satisfying in her ears? Like she wanted him to keep calling her that over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she wanted him more than ever</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands settled at the back of his neck, her body arching against him. Inviting him to touch her, and he did. Without breaking their wild and deep kiss, Nolan&#39;s hands moved downwards and he placed them at both sides of her hips. He held her tight as he sat up from the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla&#39;s hand also went to his chest and then traveled downwards in a sensual slowness until she encountered his torso running her hands through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan groaned in her mouth as she touched him. The fire had long spread and they were once again swallowed in the middle of it. Escape was no longer a choice because they were already on fire. And at that moment, they were holding each other as if all they could do now was let the fire consume them and kill them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved over to the sitting room, with Layla still in his hands and he made way for the couch, sitting on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he grabbed her again and Kissed her like a starved beast. His kiss devoured her mouth like a blazing fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he pulled her against him, molding her body to his. She felt her heart shiver in utter need and relief at the feel of him matching her hunger for him. No, whatever she gives, he gave it back two-fold and it was already driving her insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all driving her insane, never had she kissed a man this intensely before. Nolan was just too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything seemed to feel hotter, wilder and more delicious than when they started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this because the both of them had finally given in and allowed themselves to get drowned by pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel it. This man wanted her as well, there was no mistaking it. He desired her too, she was at least certain of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moan was torn from her lips when his wicked mouth descended on her neck. He lavished her skin with his kisses and all she could do was feel the dancing of the drugging sensations all over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted more. This was not nearly enough to sate her hunger. She wanted him to damn her now. She wanted him to bury himself inside her and release her from all these maddening desires that had been whirling within her since the moment he had kissed her. She was searching for that blissful release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nipped at her skin, and she tossed her head back as she shivered. Was that his response to her thoughts?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moaned in pleasure. Right. He could feel everything and probably know exactly what she was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;More... touch me... please give me more...&#39; she moaned within herself and once again, he obliged without speaking as if he read her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand finally made his way to her soft molds and he grabbed them, squeezing them softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;not there, Nolan.. not there please... I don&#39;t want to be touched there... touch me down there instead... please...&#39; she begged him wordlessly. She wanted him to tend to her aching part that needed immediate attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped and prayed that he would end this torturous back and forth foreplay that they had been engaging in for god knows how long!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arrhh.&#34; She fidgeted from the way he squeezed her breasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally removed his mischievous hands from her breasts and Layla found herself sighing in relief, he was finally going to pay attention to her aching part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to her dismay, his hands slipped past where she wanted him to touch her badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead he carried her off his body, and placed her carefully on the couch, with him on top of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered what he was going to do next, when he suddenly ripped her dress off her body, tossing the ripped dress aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla gulped down nervously, as his eyes came in contact with her breasts as he stared hungrily at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re beautiful Layla..&#34; she heard him say and Layla instantly turned crimson red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never would she have believed that he would tell her those words, that she was pretty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what she wasn&#39;t sure about, was if he was referring to her directly or her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s Adams apple popped out, as he stared at her deliciously looking breasts. Her pink nipples which were standing out, calling him to come and devour her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla began to feel shy at the way he was just staring at her and attempted to cover herself up when he held her hands back.</p>
