                <p>&#34;Stop it&#34; she giggled. She really had a great time thanks to him the lasagna she had was top notch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how are you enjoying your stay with Nolan huh?&#39; he asked, raising a brow at her.</p>

                <p>&#34;It&#39;s great so far&#34; she finally said. Though it was the opposite of it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know Nolan will treat you well. He&#39;s a nice guy..&#34; Xander said and Layla chuckled inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nice her foot! Maybe he was nice to other people but he was certainly not nice to her. At all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla is that you? woah!&#34; A voice filled with amusement rang in her ears and Layla immediately recognized the voice to be scarlet&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scarlet..&#34; she mumbled with a frown as scarlet appeared in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was scarlet doing here? How did she find her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do it is you..&#34; scarlet laughed as she raked her eyes on Xander who was standing beside Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger suddenly built up in her, why were the good looking guys always around Layla? She thought in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well today, she&#39;d make sure to shame her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Layla asked, alarmed by her presence. Scarlet shouldn&#39;t be here, she would do nothing but create a sin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you know that Layla right here has been sleeping around with all sorts of men,&#34; Scarlet accused, her voice full of false concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; Layla exclaimed, completely taken aback by the accusation. &#34;That&#39;s not true!&#34; She yelled. Scarlet would definitely embarrass her if something was not done. She only brought trouble whenever she was around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not true scarlet..&#34; Layla defended herself. She had to look for a way to stop Scarlet by a means possible. Or Scarlet would jeopardize everything without thinking twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shut up!&#34; Scarlet snapped at Layla. Seeing Layla&#39;s scared state, she knew right away that Layla didn&#39;t want her secret to be out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know he&#39;s your next target &#34; she pointed at Xander who had a confused look on his face about everything that was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look Mr, stay away from her. She&#39;s like a leech and would only suck your pocket dry..&#34; scarlet stated as Layla stood in utter disbelief. Why was scarlet out to destroy her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about, Scarlet,&#34; Layla said, her voice starting to shake with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t go around trying to steal people&#39;s boyfriends, unlike some people I know, you stole my boyfriend away from me..&#34; Layla spelled out pointing at scarlet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the slut here, not me. You slept with your sister&#39;s boyfriend, so between you and I, who&#39;s more pathetic?&#34; Layla asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you listen here, Layla,&#34; Scarlet fired, stepping closer to Layla and pointing a finger at her. &#34;I don&#39;t appreciate you talking about me like that. And I definitely don&#39;t appreciate you accusing me of being a homewrecker.&#34; She says plainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not accusing you of anything,&#34; Layla replied, trying to stay calm. &#34;I&#39;m just telling the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you&#39;re not,&#34; Scarlet said, her face turning red with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just trying to make me look bad in front of him. I didn&#39;t steal her boyfriend. She stole Mike from me instead what I simply did was taking back what was rightfully mine&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not true!&#34; Layla exclaimed, feeling her own temper starting to flare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just trying to deflect attention away from your own behavior, you&#39;re the one who sleeps around with me not me..&#34; Layla fired at scarlet. Scarlet was the terrible one here, who in the world sleeps with their sister&#39;s boyfriend and feel no remorse about it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I&#39;m not Layla. He chose me. He only left you after discovering that you were a slut..&#34; Scarlet blamed Layla glaring at her with all the hatred sfe could muster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what scarlet, you&#39;re just a two-faced, backstabbing bitch!&#34; Layla ratted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just shut up scarlet, that&#39;s enough!&#34; She hollered in frustration. She had enough already. Scarlet was taking it too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why tell me to shut up, when I&#39;m saying nothing but the truth. &#34;All you do is sleep around with men and get pregnant at the end of the day&#34; Scarlet charged at Layla and Xander who&#39;s been quiet all this while holding a puzzled look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a terrible thing to say!&#34; Layla exclaimed, her face flushing with anger and humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would never do anything like that, and you know it.&#34; Layla argued. Scarlet just kept emphasizing on the fact that she slept around with men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re such a hypocrite, Layla,&#34; Scarlet said, her voice dripping with scorn. &#34;You act like you&#39;re so perfect, but we all know the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not true!&#34; Layla said, feeling tears welling up in her eyes. &#34;You&#39;re just twisting the truth to fit your own narrative.&#34;Layla cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you&#39;re pregnant right and you don&#39;t know who the father is..&#34; Scarlet said softly as Layla&#39;s shoulders instantly fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was it, she&#39;s been ratted out. Her secret was out. Xander now knew about it and there was no way he was going to keep this a secret. Scarlet had literally done the worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please leave?&#34; Layla requested softly. Right now scarlet had to leave. She would deal with Xander later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m not leaving. Just answer my question. Are you not pregnant? Yes or No?&#34; Scarlet grilled with a note of finality in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had such a hard time finding Layla&#39;s place of work and now she did. She would make sure to humiliate Layla to the point that she would be sacked from work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of the good looking men who were always hovering around her would stop once they discovered that she was pregnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please just go..&#34; Layla cried as she couldn&#39;t hold back her tears anymore. It was becoming too much for her to bear. She was already becoming suffocated by all of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just go..&#34; she whispered, breaking down as Scarlet smiled satisfactorily. Her plan was working.</p>
