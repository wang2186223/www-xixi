                <p>&#34;Good morning ma&#34; Layla greeted the woman at the counter of the grocery store. Holding onto Maddox leash tightly. She didn&#39;t like the attention she was getting one bit and wanted to leave the grocery store as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddox was one rare and a very expensive dog. He was getting attention from people because of it&#39;s rareness. And that was something Layla hated the most. Attention!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What can I get you?&#34; The girl at the counter asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five packets of Dog chow with kibbles and bits..&#34; she requested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And also three packets of a beast and bird..&#34; these were the exact foods that Maddox ate. So she was going to get them for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That would cost you a thousand dollars..&#34; the lady informed as she placed Layla&#39;s orders in a plastic bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s my card..&#34; Layla handed over the black card to the lady. The lady stared at her for a very long time curiously before collecting the card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have wondered what a person like Layla would be doing with a black card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s your receipt..&#34; She handed over the card, receipt and plastic bag to Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go Maddox&#34; Layla led Maddox out of the store on their way out, Layla accidentally bumped into someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry..&#34; Layla apologized while picking up her stuff that fell on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry really..&#34; She apologized again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla..&#34; the person called with uncertainty in his voice as Layla immediately recognized the voice. It was Regan&#39;s but what was he doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never knew he shopped at this store, if not she would never have come here. Now he was going to ask her a lot of questions about Maddox especially.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regan!&#34; She called in surprise as she wondered what he was doing at the grocery store. This was really bad timing for her. How would she start explaining herself to him about Maddox? Regan knows she doesn&#39;t own a dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; She asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to get some cat food for kie..&#34; he responded as Layla shook her head. Kie was Regan&#39;s cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I see..&#34; she shook her head momentarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who owns that dog?&#34; He asked, pointing at Maddox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umit&#39;s&#34; Layla stammered looking for the best excuse. She can lie by saying she owned Maddox. Regan knew that she would never be able to afford a dog like Maddox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um..it&#39;s for a friend of mine..&#34; she blurted out, tucking her hair behind her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A friend?&#34; Regan drew out raising a brow at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What friend? Aurora is your only friend and Aurora Hates pets..&#34; he pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah true but it&#39;s not for Aurora. It&#39;s for a friend of my other friend. We work together. Yes we work together..&#34; she concluded breathlessly hoping Regan wouldn&#39;t catch her lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A friend at work. I see..&#34; he smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That friend of yours must be really rich.&#34; He commented as Layla grinned sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes she is. She&#39;s filthy rich..&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s actually a good thing I met you here..&#34; he began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go on a date this weekend. What did you say?&#34; He proposed and Layla suddenly began to cough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A date!&#34; She exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, a date. I really enjoyed myself the last time we went out together. So what do you say?&#34; He asked and Layla began to pick her nails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still hadn&#39;t forgotten what she went through the last time she went out with Regan. She arrived late and Nolan took it out on her for breaking his rules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddox even reportedly destroyed the stuffed animal Regan had gotten for her. Si she was not sure if she was ready for another round of torture in the hands of Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure..&#34; she began stressing her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see, I&#39;m kind of busy. But don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll let you know when I&#39;m free..&#34; she smiled warmly at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay if you say so. I&#39;ll be expecting your call shortie..&#34; Regan smiled back at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you wait up. I&#39;ll get kie&#39;s food and drop you off..&#34; he suggested but Layla quickly waved that thought off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No no no&#34; she protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need for that. I&#39;m okay..&#34; she says trying to sound convincing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I insist Layla, the last time you refused but not today. At least I should know where you live now. So come on..&#34; he persuaded as he held her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he held her hand, Maddox began to bark at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddox what is it?&#34; Layla asked but he kept on barking at Regan and people began to divert their attention at them wondering why Maddox was barking so loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on boy, shh..&#34; she tried to soothe him by rubbing his head but he kept on barking at Regan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think Maddox likes me a lot..&#34; Regan chuckled, stepping back away from Maddox and Layla. Maddox looked like he would pounce on Regan anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla immediately recollected what Nolan said about Maddox. Maddox was only calm to get because he liked her, he could be very feral to a person he hates and it seemed as if he hated Regan. A lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing in his eyes was furiousness which was directed at Regan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down, it&#39;s okay..&#34; she coaxed, rubbing its fur. Surprisingly she and Maddox had become best of friends these past two days and he listened to her a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you..&#34; she breathed out when Maddox finally calmed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will get going now, Regan..&#34; she announced standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay Layla, see you some other time..&#34; he waved as Layla made her way out of the door with Maddox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bye..&#34; she waved back at him as she walked away dragging Maddox along.</p>
