                <p>The man holding Layla was fucking goodlooking and looked rich. He had this scary Aura which would make any woman submissive to him. She wanted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anger for Layla was suddenly replaced by the inquisition to know who he was.</p>

                <p>&#34;He must be a&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!!&#34; Nolan growled at her and she cowered in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of store is this?&#34; Nolan queried at the top of his voice as he spoke again utterly angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You workers stand by like the losers that you are and watch someone being bullied without doing anything&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see to it that you all lose your jobs today, where&#39;s Paul?&#34; He requested and all the workers suddenly froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Paul, they knew he was not bluffing. Paul was the manager here and this man knew him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla stiffened in shock. Nolan&#39;s huge hands were holding her small ones firmly. She needed to stop him. Regan mentioned he had different businesses all around the world. He must own this mall also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he literally had the power to relieve everyone of their job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She can&#39;t let him do that, it was all her fault, they can&#39;t be rendered unemployed because of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you think you are?&#34; Scarlet stepped out as she eyed Nolan who shit her a sharp glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blah blah blah, all of you willblah blah blah, call paul, blahhh.&#34; She mimicked laughing out loud sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re as cheap as Layla, deceiving people with your good looks..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more word from you and I&#39;ll charge you to court for physical abuse&#34; Nolan threatened, she was one of the reasons he hated women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, I think it&#39;s best for you to shut up!!&#34; A man walked in as he stood in front of Nolan and Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, please I&#39;m very sorry for the inconveniences this woman might have caused for your girlfriend&#34; he apologized bowing his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relieve them off their jobs, I think they&#39;re tired of working, find new workers..&#34; he instructed and Layla frowned. How can he be so cruel, these people have nothing to do with this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright sir I will&#34; Paul says with his head still facing the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wouldn&#39;t dare argue with Nolan, or he would lose his job as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I apologize again and I promise to train my workers with the right ethics as for the woman she will never be welcomed here at Leigh&#39;s Mall again&#34; Paul said with a note of finality as scarlet fumbled with her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll throw her out immediately &#34; Paul signaled the security men on standby and they quickly went to grab scarlet, who struggled endlessly with them as they dragged her out like a thief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was about to walk away when Layla held him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; He questioned his tone not softening for a bit, he was still very angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S..ir.. I don&#39;t think you should fire them, they have nothing to do with this&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man in front of her could be hard to reckon with but she still has to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan pursed his lips as he stared at Layla for the longest of time before speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to fire them, deduct ten percent from their salaries&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay sir, thank you sir, thank you ma&#39;am&#34; Paul appreciated the both of them respectively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you sir&#34; Layla muttered in appreciation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan took a look at the dress she was wearing, honestly it fitted her perfectly as it brought out her curves. This was the right choice for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wrap the dress up and get her the perfect pair of shoes&#34; he ordered and the salesgirl on standby immediately went to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be in my car&#34; he said to her pushing his card into her hand as he walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry miss&#34; the salesgirl apologized to Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing&#34; Layla waved her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re very lucky miss, you have a rich boyfriend who listens to only you,&#34; the salesgirl smiled, leading Layla to the dressing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; boyfriend my foot &#39; she scoffed inwardly. He was a terror to her , she wondered what must have happened to him to make him act the way he did usually he would scold her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you also, because of you we still have our jobs&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; Layla smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Change into your clothes, I&#39;ll get you a collection of shoes to choose from&#34; the salesgirl said walking out of the dressing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look so stunning miss&#34; Keisha the stylist who had dolled Layla up admired as Layla stood in front of the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks Keisha&#34; Layla smiled brightly, truly she looked stunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had taken her to a stylist after they left the mall and she had a great time here. Keisha was very nice along with her workers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can say that again,&#34; Keisha giggled. &#34; It&#39;s all thanks to my talents&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The AlpI mean Nolan will not be able to take his eyes off you&#34; Keisha said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and the president must be close to each other?&#34; Layla reasoned seeing Keisha called Nolan by his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well we&#39;re close acquaintances, so..&#34; Keisha shrugged her shoulders. Her and Nolan knew each other way back even before he became an Alpha, they were like close buddies. And she happened to be mated to his Beta Darren.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks again,&#34; Layla appreciated. Keisha really did a good job , from styling her hair perfectly, down to the make up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no need to trim her hair again when she went back to New York. It has already been done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Nolan&#39;s waiting,&#34; Keisha said, giving Layla a purse to match her clothes as she led her outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These heels are really a hassle&#34; Layla commented, she was not a fan of heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll get used to it&#34; Keisha assured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked outside the huge salon to see Nolan standing outside in front of his car waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dressed in a three piece black suit, his dark red hair styled making him look more handsome and matured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my Nolan! Don&#39;t blind me with your looks&#34; Keisha teased as they stopped in front of Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say that to your mate not me&#34; Nolan said and Layla was surprised that he could speak with a soft tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I offer you your bride,&#34; Keisha said playfully, placing Layla&#39;s hand on his as she made them hold hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not my bride&#34; Nolan drew out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop being a bore and tell her she looks pretty&#34; Keisha motioned and Nolan traveled his gaze to Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really looked prettier tonight, almost like a goddess under the moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s pretty right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re running late, get into the car Layla..&#34; he gestured, removing his hand from hers as he made way to open the car but Keisha stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so unromantic, you have to open the car door for her to go in&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do that yourself &#34; Nolan uttered and got into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mind him, Layla, &#34; Keisha smiled at Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s just how Nolan is but trust me he&#39;s a great guy, you guys will really make a good couple &#34; Keisha informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s only a business meeting, not a date,&#34; Layla mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter Layla, you never can tell anything can happen, I&#39;ll walk you over instead &#34; Keisha offered as she walked Layla to the other side of the car, opening the door for her to go in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That wasn&#39;t really necessary, &#34; Layla uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have fun,&#34; Keisha waved at both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Abd treat her well Nolan, she&#39;s your date!&#34; She says playfully but Nolan accelerated the car ignoring her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keisha watched as Nolan&#39;s car drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mate Darren had told her everything. How Layla is Nolan&#39;s second chance mate and how he plans on rejecting her because he doesn&#39;t like one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan could be so impossible to deal with at times, who in the world would reject a lady as pretty as Layla?</p>
