                <p>Layla sucked in a deep breath as she stood on the porch of Nolan&#39;s apartment. She was about to go to work. Nolan was long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well he went to work alone in his car while she had to board a taxi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would get a car once she learnt how to drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She began to walk towards the road, so that she could catch a taxi and she wanted to visit the pharmacy also to get some drugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla had still not forgotten what Nolan had done to get, after that day, she made sure never to break any of his rules and stayed away from him as far as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Taxi..&#34; she waved down a taxi which was passing by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily for her, she found one early. Before she had to wait for ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me to Raleigh company and please drop by any nearest pharmacy..&#34; she informed the driver who shook his head in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>

                <p>&#34;Good morning Bertha&#34; She greeted Bertha as she walked away from her as fast as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her little observation, she was becoming the main topic in the company amongst the women as they gossiped about the expensive clothes she recently started to wear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The least she could do was avoid them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Layla..&#34; Bertha waved back cheerfully but Layla was already out of earshot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting into her office, she sat down after settling down ready for the day&#39;s job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my goodness..&#34; Layla groaned looking at the work that was stock piled for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered if Nolan had no conscience for her. He just stock piled work for her, not even thinking of the fact that she&#39;s just one, there&#39;s no one to help her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little wonders that none of his past secretaries lasted for more than a month. They were obviously fed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hissed in annoyance beginning the day&#39;s job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was buried in her work when Xander walked into her office and said to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey there, Layla! Are you ready to take a break from all that hard work and grab a bite to eat with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla looked up with a smile and replied &#34;Haha, you&#39;re such a smooth talker! But I&#39;m pretty busy here, so I&#39;m not sure I can take a break right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She totally forgot that it was lunch time, if not for Xander who had come to inform her, she would have probably had no idea about that as she was so engrossed in work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aw, come on, just a quick lunch break to recharge your batteries. You&#39;ll come back to work feeling refreshed and ready to tackle anything. Besides, my treat!&#34; Xander playfully said as he stood in front of her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for that Xander but I&#39;m pretty much occupied. Maybe another day..&#34; She politely refused his offer, though she was starving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you&#39;re trying to act tough. But I&#39;m not giving up that easily. How about if I bring the food to you, and you can eat it at your desk while you work? Then you can kill two birds with one stone.&#34; He offered but Layla shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re being nice, but I&#39;m good.&#34; she smiled warmly at him. She would just grab something after lunch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, I&#39;m just trying to be a good friend, who&#39;s looking out for his Luna. No ulterior motives here, promise! But I understand if you&#39;re busy. Can I at least bring you a coffee?&#34; He offered. He knew that Nolan must have kept a lot of work for her, that&#39;s why he was being nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I get it, you&#39;re a tough cookie! I&#39;ll back off for now, but know that the offer stands if you ever need a break. I&#39;m always happy to help!&#34; He intoned, raising his hands in surrender. He can&#39;t possibly force her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re a good friend Xander, but Nolan would kill me if I eat at the office&#34; she uttered, dropping her pen on the desk. She was afraid of what Nolan would do if he caught her eating in the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haha, I totally get it. You don&#39;t want to get on Nolan&#39;s bad side! He&#39;s a lucky guy to have such a hardworking and loyal Luna. But trust me. He&#39;ll be okay with this..&#34; he assured as Layla snorted inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; if only they knew how cruel Nolan was &#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright let&#39;s go out to eat&#34; she finally relented not to make him feel bad. And also to think about herself for once. It was lunch break. It was not wrong if she had something to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the spirit! I know a great little Italian place nearby, how does that sound?&#34; He suggested as Layla shook her head in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That would be great!&#34; She exclaimed standing up from her chair, putting some things in order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go..&#34; she said, grabbing her purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After you..&#34; Xander opened the door slightly for her to pass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be silly Xander,&#34; she laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have hands..&#34; they both walked out of the office, on their way out they met with Carla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carla!!&#34; Xander exclaimed in surprise on seeing Carla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Xander, Layla&#34; she forced out a smile waving at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Xander grilled curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to see Nolan, is he in?&#34; She pointed at the direction of Nolan&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah he is..&#34; Layla replied, tugging Xander&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go..&#34; she muttered and they both left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bitch..&#34; Carla cursed under her breath and she headed for Nolan&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Carla entered the office, she passed through Layla&#39;s desk with the files she was working on, then an idea struck her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing around to make sure no one was looking, she quickly grabbed the files and headed to the shredding machine in the corner of the office. With a sly smile on her face, she feeds the files into the shredder, watching them turn into tiny pieces of paper. She then put the shredded remains into the recycling bin and wiped her hands on her pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gotcha..&#34; she grinned wickedly as if she had just won a lottery. Nolan will scold Layla if he realizes what has happened. As Layla will be the one to blame for it.</p>
