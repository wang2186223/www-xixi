                <p>&#34;You guys really don&#39;t learn, do you?&#34; He tsk launching at them. He just hopes Layla would be wise enough to run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla remained rooted to the ground as a man was pointing a gun right at her, was this how she was going to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked towards Nolan&#39;s direction and saw that he was busy fighting off the men who surrounded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was all Alone now. Layla was pretty sure that if she moved an inch, she would be shot and if she didn&#39;t, she would still be shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh god please come to my rescue&#34; she prayed silently placing her hands on her stomach as a bullet came flying right towards her, she closed her eyes shut, waiting for what was to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Few seconds later Layla didn&#39;t feel any pain but instead she felt someone shielding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S..ir&#34; she mumbled, shaking as she opened her eyes slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was right in front of her holding her close to himself. He had saved her from the hands of death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized that the bullet never got to her because Nolan had taken the bullet for her because she was sure she saw the man pull the trigger, she also heard gunshots and then she saw the Bullet flying towards her before she closed her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S..ir are you alright?&#34; She stammered in horror as she tried looking for the spot where he was shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did he collect a bullet for her? She didn&#39;t want to be the cause of a person&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s leave here immediately&#34; Nolan said, shielding her with his body as he went for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was so lucky that he got to her in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One bullet would do him no harm but she&#39;ll die if she gets shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir are you alright?&#34; Layla&#39;l asked again in fear as she wondered how he was looking fine when he had been shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up and move!!&#34; He growled which made her flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about yourself and let&#39;s get out of this place, damn you&#34; he dragged her out of the room as they managed to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get into the car&#34; he instructed, throwing his car key to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla caught the hey right in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just go in there and wait for me,&#34; he ordered, facing Hayes&#39;s men. His car was bulletproof and Layla would be safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure to feed your flesh to the vultures, after this&#34; he swore, punching one of them right through the face. And he aimed for another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really are stronger than I imagined Alpha&#34; Hayes began as he walked towards Nolan who just finished killing another of his men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were you expecting?&#34; Nolan smirked, his face and hands stained with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not his first time shedding blood, so this was not new to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had dealt with enemies who were worse than Hayes. Hayes was just a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know you won&#39;t last for long, the poison in you will start having its effects and will weaken you&#34; Hayes smiled triumphantly as Nolan scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think one bullet can hold me down ?&#34; He questioned with a sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure you all rot well in hell&#34; he swore in anger. He just couldn&#39;t fathom why some people could be so stupid. Even after losing half of his men, Hayes still thought he could defeat him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get him and get her also, even if it means you have to tear that car apart!&#34; Hayes growled pointing at Nolan&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla burped loudly when she saw Hayes pointing at her. She wondered what business Nolan must have had with him that made him want to kill him so badly, that now she has been dragged into their feud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really like playing with fire don&#39;t you?&#34; Nolan cracked his neck, launching at them as he either ripped off their head or heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayes&#39; men were no match for him, Layla marveled at his strength and how cool he looked but she couldn&#39;t help but cringe at the way he spilled blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon Nolan was standing right in front of Hayes, who stood in shock. All his men were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t ever underestimate an Alpha &#34; he grunted, punching Hayes right on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced sideways and saw some of Hayes&#39;s men approaching, he needed to leave immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll hear from me&#34; he promised, throwing Hayes to the ground as he kicked his groin with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly walked to his car as Hayes men were fast approaching, he was about to go into the car, when one of them shot at him as the bullet hit his abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck..&#34; Nolan cursed getting into the car, which Layla had already started and he drove off with speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they were already a few meters away, Layla asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir are you alright? You&#39;ve been shot!!&#34; She squealed, she would have offered to drive the car but sadly she never learnt how to drive a car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!!&#34; He snarled at her, focusing his eyes on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to hear a word from you!&#34; He warned and Layla decided to mind her business. She was just trying to be caring as she couldn&#39;t help but worry for his life.</p>
