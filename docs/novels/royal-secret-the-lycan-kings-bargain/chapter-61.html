                <p>Layla walked slowly to her room as helpless tears flowed down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Nolan had done was just the height of it all. He purposely left her in cold water for more than thirty minutes and when he finally let her out. He didn&#39;t show any remorse for it. But instead treated her like a nobody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got into her room and closed the door behind her. Dragging her feet to her bed, she slumped on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?..&#34; A sob slipped her lips as she clenched her fist on the bed sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was soaking wet and was cold. It felt as if her whole strength had left her. She felt disgusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only did he toss her out like trash, he sent her out completely naked not caring about her feelings or whatsoever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone which was lying a few meters away from her chimed and she weakly reached out for it to check it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Written on the screen was a text from Regan asking her if she reached home safely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; Hey shortie, did you reach home safely? &#39; the text read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla sniffled, wiping a tear off from her eyes as she typed back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; yeah I did. What about you? &#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Same here. It was really fun to have you around today ( grinning emoji) &#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; me too &#39; Layla typed back. He actually made her very happy today only for Nolan to end up ruining it for her because of a very pointless reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; Do you want to call?&#39; he asked and Layla quickly declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;can&#39;t talk now. I&#39;ll call tomorrow.&#39; she informed. Right now her voice was hoarse and broken. Regan would know at once that something was wrong with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; if you say so. Good night.. &#39;he wished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; You too&#39; Layla dropped the phone on her bed as he buried her head on her pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she wouldn&#39;t even think of freshening up, as Nolan has done her that favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging herself out of the bed she walked over to her closet to grab some clothes which she slowly wore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teeth shattered as she was getting down with a cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she this unfortunate, even in her pregnant state, she was being made to suffer. Even when the doctor told her to worry about the health of her child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After putting on the clothes, she went to her bedside and took out some pills from the drawer which she swallowed before sitting on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing her hand on her flat tummy, she caressed it softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey there..&#34; she muttered in a very low voice as she rubbed her tummy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you doing down there? &#34; She asked, looking down at her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess you&#39;re doing great!&#34; She chuckled dryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;m not doing great today, not in any way..&#34; a sob came out from her lips as tears flowed down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Mommy is not doing great and feels life is being taken away from her&#34; she cried softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel suffocated..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I promise to be strong for no one but you and you have to be strong for me also, hmm..&#34; she smiled. This baby was truly the only hope she had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not Nolan who claimed to be her mate but treated her like trash and she did not want to burden Aurora with her problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you..&#34; she stammered in tears as she fell weakly on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling cold chills round her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed something to warm herself up or she might catch a cold, then she would be down with a fever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the last thing she wanted was to fall sick and then Nolan would have to take her to the hospital, that&#39;s if he cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he eventually did that, there would be a chance of him finding out about her pregnancy, so falling sick was a big no for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting up from the bed, she headed to the kitchen to make herself hot tea and soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Maddox who was allegedly playing with her stuffed animal as she had to time for the dog or his owner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made the hot tea first which she slowly drank. After feeling a little more relieved, she proceeded to make the hot soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A recipe she made herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was patiently waiting for her soup to get done when she heard footsteps. Knowing who it might probably be, she simply ignored him and acted as if no one was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; She heard him ash but pretended as if she didn&#39;t hear a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked forward, staring into outer space when Nolan suddenly grabbed her jaw, tilting her head to look him in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m talking you you!!&#34; He heard and Layla flinched in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m making soup..&#34; she stammered in fear of getting another punishment of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not in for another round of torture from Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; So you&#39;ve finally got your tongue..&#34; he smirked, removing his hand from her jaw as he stepped away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not hear you speak..&#34;she defended herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would you? When you&#39;re as dumb as you seem. I didn&#39;t expect anything more from you..&#34; he shook his head, proceeding to make his own cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole kitchen was utterly quiet afterwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your toy is destroying my stuff..&#34; Layla cried out. As he slowly turned to look at Maddox who was tearing her stuffed animal to pieces with his claws and teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get another one &#34; he said as Layla scoffed in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was a gift..&#34; she protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it was, good thing Maddox is destroying it&#34; Nolan said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I can&#39;t believe this..&#34; she muttered angrily. First was him torturing her, now his dog was destroying her gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to..&#34; he dropped his cup of tea loudly on the table and he continued moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t think of trying anything stupid or you know the outcome..&#34; he threatened and Layla stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And also if you ever defile my orders you&#39;ll get a punishment much worse than this..&#34; he warned sternly before walking away from a furious Layla.</p>
