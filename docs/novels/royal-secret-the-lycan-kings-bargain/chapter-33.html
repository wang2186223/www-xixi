                <p>After driving to a point, Nolan stepped out of the car as he spoke to Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come out&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla immediately came out of the car, her bare feet hitting the cold ground, she lost her shoes when trying to run away from their attackers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going sir? Layla couldn&#39;t help but ask him, because he didn&#39;t expect her to walk barefooted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To my lake house, you&#39;ll be safe there&#34; he replied as they continued walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we walking there?&#34; She questioned because she was not expected to walk barefoot there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; No, I had someone arrange a car for me, we will get there soon&#34; he responded as they continued walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had discarded his car there Incase Hayes was tracking him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About a few minutes later, they both came face to face to a black car, which was lying at the side of the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla looked around her surroundings, they were literally in the middle of nowhere, it was already dark and not a single soul was seen around this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in&#34; he instructed getting into the car also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla noticed that a car key was already placed there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you have a backup car?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; Nolan responded, Xander knew exactly what to do and had placed a car on standby. He texted him the location earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how did you..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xander took care of it&#34; he replied driving off as Layla shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan surely has a lot of influence, he gets everybody done with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s car pulled up in front of a lake house which looked deserted. They finally arrived after driving for quite a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla couldn&#39;t help but sneer as they walked into the house, so he had a place like this and he went ahead to lodge a hotel, why did he then bother to do that and make them share a room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan and Layla got into the house and all the lights immediately lit up the moment they walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, it&#39;s quite cozy&#34; Layla mumbled to herself, she needed a thorough shower, a pedicure and a foot massage, because her feet hurt as hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should go in&#34; she informed as she needed maximum rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t forget the fact that she was pregnant, which means that she needed rest, which is something she has not gotten since she arrived in Seattle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It started with her asthma attack, then scarlet, whom she miraculously escaped, if not her secret could have been exposed, now that attack and all the strange things that have been happening alongside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to take a step when she heard a loud thud. She quickly turned in fear thinking maybe their attackers caught up with them again, but to her dismay she found Nolan sitting on the ground, resting against the wall. He was the one who fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir!!&#34; She exclaimed, rushing to him , as she squatted in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Has the bullet inside of him started having its effects? She thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Sir are you alright?&#34; She asked, though she knew the answer. It was right in front of her, he was not alright. A sheen of sweat gathered on his forehead and he looked vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing that he was shot, she began to unbutton his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his shirt came off, Layla gasped in shock, as she fumbled backwards, sitting on the ground In bewilderment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only was he smoking hot, with ink lining his skin, she never knew he had a tattoo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His skin was turning pale blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows furrowed, though she was not a medical expert, she was sure a person&#39;s skin wouldn&#39;t turn blue when shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gosh..&#34; she rushed back to him, placing her hands on his shoulders. She needed to do something. He looked weak, whatever that was, was weakening him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How has he been managing since? This man is no doubt very strong. He showed no signs of pain throughout the whole ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I do?&#34; She mumbled shakily. He was not in a good condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly placed her hands over the wound to at least stop the bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would have thought he was bleeding also? The clothes he wore were black, that&#39;s why she never noticed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla realized that placing her hands over the wound was not helping, he was still breathing profusely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up his shirt, placing it over on his wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla felt very scared, he didn&#39;t want him to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I do now?&#34; She mumbled, biting her lips in frustration. Layla was already on the verge of crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The father of her baby is about to die and there&#39;s nothing she can do about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get a lighter..&#34; she heard a low voice and she quickly looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir..&#34; she called in relief, placing her hands on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening to you? I&#39;m very scared, I think we should call a doctor..&#34; she quivered. Thank God he was still awake. He was the only one that could tell what was going on with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get a lighter, I&#39;ve been poisoned..&#34; Nolan said in a raspy voice. The bullets were laced with wolfbane, not only that, Hayes has shot him with a silver bullet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to get it out of him quickly because the poison was spreading fast or today would be his last day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poisoned!!&#34; Layla shrieked in horror. That was the reason his skin color was Changing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get the damn lighter!&#34; He gritted his teeth in annoyance and Layla quickly stood up on her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get it immediately, please don&#39;t die&#34; she rushed out to find the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea what he wanted to use a lighter for, but since he requested one, she should get that, if it can save his life.</p>
