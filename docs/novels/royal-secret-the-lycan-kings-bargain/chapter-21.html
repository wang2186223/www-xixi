                <p>&#34;I guess my timing was perfect, hop in&#34; he invited her pointing at the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But where are we going?&#34; Layla asked in confusion.</p>

                <p>She was not in the mood as Nolan and Carla completely spoiled her mood, so she was not in for any dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can go Regan&#34; she refused as she spoke in a polite manner, not wanting to upset him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I may ask, why?&#34; He raised a brow, staring curiously at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it&#39;s because I&#39;m tired,&#34; Layla blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was honestly tired and needed a good head rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why I want to treat you to a meal, you should cool off Layla, I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re working so hard here&#34; he tried to persuade her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His handsome face was bright as always, one flaw about Regan was that he did not know how to get angry, he was always smiling and knew how to mask his feelings very well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why today Regan&#34; Layla groaned, she really doesn&#39;t want to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Work today was hectic, I need some rest&#34; she yawned trying to convince him that she was really tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla..&#34; Regan drawled holding her hands as she had this exhausted look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I&#39;m not going to buy that right, so come with me please?&#34; He pouted, making a funny face as Layla burst into a loud laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He surely knows how to lighten up her mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No..&#34; she bluntly refused with a sly smile on her face as she wanted to pull his legs a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shortiecome on&#34; Regan said, dragging her hands that he was holding playfully. Anyone who would see them right now, would think that they were couples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I thought I told you not to call me shortie,&#34; Layla pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a lady..&#34; she frowned but Regan kept on smiling at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright lady, let&#39;s go out for a meal&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But mind you, you&#39;ll always remain my shortie,&#34; he quickly added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34; A cold steel voice asked as Layla instantly froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognizes that voice, the coldness, whenever the person speaks, he speaks without emotions, how can she not recognize his voice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what was he doing here?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir&#34; Layla squinted her eyes on seeing Nolan standing not too far from them together with Xander, it seemed as if he was about to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going on here?&#34; Nolan asked again, trying not to sound angry or curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was that he was very curious to know who the guy with Layla was, they way they spoke to each other, once could easily think they were dating, which left him very curious to know who the man was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That girl over there is his freaking mate who he is planning to reject the next full moon and she&#39;s speaking so freely and openly to another man, which leaves him troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir we are about to leave&#34; Layla stammered blinking her eyes repeatedly as she tried not to look him in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so terrified of him and at the same time wanted to punch his good looking face badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you leave the office?&#34; He questioned her. He approached them only to see the man Layla was with, nothing else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Immediately I was done with work, sir&#34; Layla replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he expecting her to wait till he was done?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Visitors are not allowed here&#34; he began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a company not some romantic spot for couples&#34; he added in sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey man&#34; Xander waved at Regan who stood behind Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey&#34; Regan waved back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; Do you know him? &#39; Nolan asked Xander in a mind link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; Yes, a friend, &#39; Xander replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; When did you start having friends &#39; Nolan grilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; He&#39;s someone I met at the club sometime, I also had something with his sister in the past, he&#39;s the one who referred Layla here &#39; Xander explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; I know what you&#39;re thinking, don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s not dating Layla, no need to be jealous &#39; xander said in mischief as Regan shot a glare at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; shut up &#39; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have a nice day Layla, you too Regan&#34; Xander waved at them as he left with Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s he?&#34; Regan grilled after Nolan was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My boss&#34; Layla muttered in exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Nolan have to show up, honestly he didn&#39;t even say anything reasonable, he probably came to torment her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know him?&#34; Layla sounded surprised, if Regan knew Xander. He should as well know Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Regan shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you meet Xander?&#34; Layla asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We met a few times at the club and he&#39;s Aurora&#39;s Ex&#34; he whispered the last few words as Layla gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aurora dated him!&#34; Layla yelled her mouth ajar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora never told her that she dated a hottie. Like Xander was a freaky hot and rich guy, Aurora never mentioned him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have known that Xander was the friend of Regan that helped her with this job, but why has Aurora never talked about her hot ex since she was a fan of hot guys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, hmm, it was for a short while though&#34; Regan confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hop in, we&#39;re running late&#34; he got into the car, Layla following suit as well, as he drove off.</p>
