                <p>&#34;Layla, Layla,&#34; Nolan called softly as he shook Layla&#39;s body gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla,&#34; Layla&#39;s eyes fluttered open as she blinked them repeatedly. She yelled in fright as she sat up quickly from the ground. She passed out because of the fear of being eaten by a wolf-like dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haa!!!!&#34; She yelled, clutching the person behind her tight; the dog was seated right in front of her, with its tongue sticking out as it panted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slowly looked up to see the person behind her but only screamed in shock when their eyes met. His icy blue eyes pierced through her. She thought he had something important to take care of, what was he doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S..ir,&#34; she stammered, still holding him tight, not wanting to let go in fear of being bitten by the dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why were you lying on the ground?&#34; He snapped at her as he stood up, leaving her on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I fainted,&#34; she replied breathlessly. Was he asking her a pointless question? Did he not meet her unconscious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why did you faint?&#34; He uttered in a cold voice. He came here running like a mad man thinking something bad had happened to her. He was supposed to be at the pack house right now. He collected her contact number from the employee list earlier, so he could ask her if she had successfully delivered the files. But when he called and got no response from her, the wolf inside of him became anxious thinking something might have happened to its mate, that&#39;s the reason he came here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of..&#34; Layla stuttered, pointing her index finger at the dog who barked at her immediately it saw her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haa!!!&#34; She screamed, bolting up from the ground, and she went to hold Nolan tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of Maddox?&#34; He raised a brow at her, and she nodded. It was all because of Maddox, the dog was just as scary as its owner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddox is a harmless dog; it only wants to play,&#34; Nolan spelled out, gritting his teeth. He basically came running here for nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t like to play,&#34; she said softly. If this was the definition of playing, then she didn&#39;t mind being a serious-minded person all the days of her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said no one was home,&#34; she began in accusation. He would have mentioned the dog so she could take extra precautions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one is home,&#34; he deadpanned as his eyes traveled to her hands that were holding his arms tight. He badly wanted to push her away but his body and mind were not working together. His body wanted her but his mind didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But there&#39;s a dog,&#34; she breathed out, still shaken by the fact that she almost got eaten by a dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And it wanted to eat me,&#34; she mouthed, sending deadly glares at Maddox who sat obediently wagging its tail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it wanted to eat you, your bones would have been the only thing left on the ground; he only wants to play,&#34; he informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddox,&#34; he called out, and Maddox immediately sat up quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here,&#34; he called, and Maddox came to meet him obediently. Layla immediately held him tighter when Maddox came close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He means no harm,&#34; Nolan began squatting down as he placed his hands on Maddox&#39;s head, rubbing it softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In fact, I think he likes you, because on a normal day no random person will walk out of that door alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Can you hear yourself!!&#39; Layla wanted to say, but controlled herself. He knows how feral his dog is, but still he sent her here. What if the dog didn&#39;t end up liking her? Then she would have been dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I should get going, it&#39;s getting late,&#34; Layla announced, having a look at her watch; it was a few minutes to nine. For how long was she out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you should,&#34; Nolan uttered, standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, sir,&#34; Layla said, walking away, and she bolted out of the door in a haste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla walked alone along the dark road. She waited for the taxi for a long time, and when it didn&#39;t come, she opted to walk. It was so late at night, and it seemed as if it would rain soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aurora will be so worried,&#34; she muttered to herself. Her phone battery was dead, and there was no way she could get through Aurora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon the rain began to pour heavily, and Layla had no choice but to hide under a tree, which did not help in shielding her from the rain. Her body was already very wet, and on top of it all, she was feeling very cold and hungry. Because of the work piled up for her, she didn&#39;t have lunch, the same thing with breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all because of him,&#34; Layla gritted, squatting under the tree as she was getting drenched in the rain. If not for the baby she was carrying, she would have walked home regardless of the rain. But now she had something to protect; she couldn&#39;t afford to get a cold or even stress herself out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all because of him,&#34; she sniffled, tears dropping from her eyes. The rain didn&#39;t seem as if it was going to stop soon as it got heavier each passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I do now?&#34; She whimpered sadly, placing her hands around her stomach in a protective manner. She would have walked back to his house, but she felt too cold to do that; he was the cause of all this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever happened between them was never her fault; it was because of the alcohol she took, and she never forced herself on him. Then why should he take it out on her and make her suffer from it? If he feels as if he made a mistake, he should take it out on himself, not her. She was never the cause of him cheating on his rude girlfriend who she hated so much at first sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate him,&#34; she shivered, feeling nothing but pure hate for him. She once found him attractive, but not anymore. She hated him. He probably sent her to his house to purposely make her go home at night. Which grown man would leave a lady all by herself at this time of the night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still squatting under the tree when she noticed an approaching vehicle, its light shining brightly on her. She wanted to stand up and wave for the car to stop, but she had no strength left in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up right in front of Layla, and she wondered who it was. Someone stepped out of the car holding an umbrella, and he walked up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla,&#34; the person called, and she slowly looked up to see the dangerously good-looking face of the person she hated more than anything. Nolan Alden.</p>
