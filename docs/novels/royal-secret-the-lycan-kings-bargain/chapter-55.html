                <p>&#34;Thanks for the ride Xander..&#34; Layla thanked Xander as he pulled up in front of Nolan&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anytime..&#34; he smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do take care, hmmm. See you some other time..&#34; he waved as Layla stepped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too bye..&#34; she watched as he drove away. She inhaled sharply walking towards Nolan&#39;s apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered why he decided to live in a penthouse when he was filthy rich.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped at the door hesitating if she should go in. Her last visit here was not so pleasant as she had not forgotten about Maddox, how she passed out and how Nolan lashed out on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddox was one scary dog that she couldn&#39;t help but to be scared of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking in deep breaths, she brought out the key which Xander had given her earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening the door slowly, she placed one of her legs into the house cautiously, in fear that Maddox might sprang up on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to take another step when she heard a loud bark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh god!!&#34; She yelled, slamming the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going in there..&#34; she gasped leaning on the door as she took in heavy breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could still hear Maddox barking loudly as he had perceived her as an intruder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was certain that he was not going to move an inch from the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh god what do I do? She asked no one in particular falling helplessly to the ground as she sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no other option than to wait for the owner of Maddox to come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but wonder if he loved torturing her. He knew fully well that she was scared of Maddox but still sent her to his place alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck!&#34; She cursed in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this how she was going to wait till Nolan came back? Only God knew when he would get back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was seated at his porch like a homeless person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should just leave and come back later&#34; she suggested to herself. She can go back home and come back in the evening, since it was still morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, that won&#39;t work. I don&#39;t have a car..&#34; she bit her lips hard. Nolan&#39;s street was like a secluded place. There was hardly any taxi and it was exceptionally quiet. It would take ages before she found a taxi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn you Nolan..&#34; she cursed resting against the door as she brought out her laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Geez, it&#39;s been so long!&#34; She exclaimed, sucking her teeth. She input her password as she checked a few things in her laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her novels and poems. She had lived writing since she was a child and had actually written a lot of books though they were yet to be published all because of one person. Rosalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never supported her dream of becoming a writer, not even once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Going through her books, Layla&#39;s heart ached. This was definitely not the way she wanted her life to work out. She never wanted to become a single mother not to talk of being mated to a werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she could say was that everything happened for a reason. She should just be patient and see how her life would turn out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla&#39;s brows furrowed as she clasped her eyes tighter, because of the sun that was directly hitting her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yawned, taking a more comfortable position as she looked away from the direction of the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; She mumbled feeling a towering height above her, blocking the rays of the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She muttered, feeling a hard gaze on her. Someone was there. She yelled and she sprang up from the ground as if a bee stung her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nol..an?&#34; She spluttered seeing him stand in front of her with a stern look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was wearing a suit and she guessed he was just returning from the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; He asked in a single breath. He decided to come home early today only to see someone sleeping on his pouch. He was shocked at first and was even more shocked when he saw Layla there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;II&#34; she stammered picking up her laptop from the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you speak!&#34; He snapped in a low and domineering tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you sleeping outside Layla?&#34; He asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;II came here and Iwalkedinto the house..but&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what?&#34; He drilled calmly which bewildered Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddox hehe&#34; Layla stammered picking her nails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddox..&#34; Nolan chuckled dryly. He knew it already. It was because of Maddox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She basically stayed outside because of a harmless dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve told you before, Maddox is harmless..&#34; he drew out word by word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he barked..&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you&#39;re very silly..&#34; he chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He must have barked because he sensed how stupid you are!&#34; He yelled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you went in like a thief&#34; he guessed. She must have probably tried to sneak in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That must be why Maddox barked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just shut up, I don&#39;t want to hear anything from you! &#34; He fired at her reaching out for the door knob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately he opened the door, Maddox came rushing out, ready to pounce on the intruder but calmed down on seeing Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey buddy&#34; A smile ghosted Nolan&#39;s face as he squatted before Maddox rubbing its fur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on..&#34; he stood up, and he walked into his house, Maddox following behind him as he wagged its tail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla stood at the entrance of the door in fear watching as Nolan played with Maddox who didn&#39;t even spare her a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you still doing outside?&#34; He questioned fixing his attention on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you plan on staying outside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you do, I don&#39;t mind leaving you there..&#34; he smirked, giving her a knowing look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m coming. in&#34; Layla stuttered as she forced herself to move. Reassuring herself silently that Maddox was harmless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally got into the house and she locked the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he bite?&#34; Nolan catechized with a sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to learn how to live with Maddox Layla&#34; he drew out and all Layla could do was nod her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you&#39;re here, there&#39;ll be certain rules that you&#39;ll need to follow..&#34; he began as Layla looked up at him puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What freaking rules did he want her to follow again!?</p>
