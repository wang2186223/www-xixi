                <p>Layla typed noisily on her laptop as she occasionally looked up as if she was waiting for someone. Well, Nolan, her boss, was not at work today, and she just wondered why he didn&#39;t show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt maybe he would be coming late; that was why she occasionally looked up to see if he was coming, though it was involuntarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want him to show up, but she just couldn&#39;t stop her head from looking upwards each time she heard a noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard footsteps, and she quickly looked up. &#34;Sir,&#34; the chair made a screech sound as she stood up, but it was Xander&#39;s face that came into view, not Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla, how are you doing?&#34; He waved at her, approaching her table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m good,&#34; she smiled sheepishly as he dropped some files on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan said I should give you these,&#34; he informed as Layla nodded slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should get them ready before tomorrow, and he will not be coming today,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, sir,&#34; she thanked him, feeling kind of glad that Nolan would not be at work today; another free from his hostility, no one would yell at her today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to take her seat when Xander called out to her. &#34;Layla.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything else you would need, sir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, actually, I just wanted to ask a question; I hope you don&#39;t mind?&#34; He asked with a warm smile plastered on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all; I don&#39;t mind,&#34; replied Layla, motioning for him to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you from?&#34; He began, and Layla had this perplexed look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just curious; that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking; it&#39;s stated on your resume that you just moved to New York, that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, that. I&#39;m from Seattle,&#34; she replied, speaking of which, she&#39;s not heard from her family since the day she left; she did not know how to call her father, and he did not call her also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seattle?&#34; He pursed his lips as Layla nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about your family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re all in Seattle; I came here to work,&#34; she replied, curious about why he was suddenly asking her questions about herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; he mouthed, shaking his head. The Alpha&#39;s mate is a human, but it didn&#39;t matter at all. In fact, Xander found Layla likable; the only problem was Nolan, who felt like he didn&#39;t need a mate as he still misses his late mate a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like you, Layla,&#34; he suddenly uttered, and Layla&#39;s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34; She burped loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, not like that,&#34; he chuckled, sensing where her mind was wandering off to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean like a friend; I want to be friends, hope you don&#39;t mind?&#34; He proposed with a wide smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...I...don&#39;t mind,&#34; Layla smiled back at him; she didn&#39;t mind at all; it&#39;s just friendship, and he didn&#39;t seem like one who had ulterior motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great!&#34; He exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then come with me,&#34; he offered warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Co...me wit...h you?&#34; Layla stuttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m going out for lunch; you can tag along if you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind at all,&#34; Layla said, wanting to get away from work; she was already more than tired, she needed to take a break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wrap up; I&#39;ll be waiting outside,&#34; he said, walking out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, sir,&#34; Layla quickly arranged the files together, she arranged her hair, grabbed her purse before dashing out of the office. This would be the first time she will be having lunch together with a person since she started working; before it was either she ate alone and late, or she didn&#39;t even get to eat at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, are you leaving now?&#34; Carla asked the moment Nolan stepped out from his room. It was obvious he was leaving as he was already dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he replied, shutting the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let me come along?&#34; She requested gingerly. She was already dressed, looking all dolled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need; stay back at the pack,&#34; he refused her offer, walking away from her, but Carla was determined. She won&#39;t give up that easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Nolan, you can be so mean sometimes,&#34; she complained walking behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;But that&#39;s what I love the most about you&#39; she added in her thoughts. She loved his savageness, how he did his things perfectly; he was like a savage lord, a good-looking one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me come along, please,&#34; she requested, but he didn&#39;t give her a reply as he continued walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise to be of good behavior; please, it&#39;s just for two weeks, I&#39;m only coming over for sightseeing; I&#39;m going for a tour,&#34; she uttered as Nolan abruptly stopped in his tracks, turning to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been to New York almost a thousand times, Carla, and I&#39;m sure you know the map like the back of your palms, so no, stay back,&#34; he stated, and he continued walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, but I heard from a friend that there are new places in New York, so I want to try it out, there&#39;s a new restaurant, a whole lot of new places,&#34; she tried convincing him as she held his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Nolan,&#34; she pouted like a baby, hoping he would fall for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, you can come with me,&#34; Nolan obliged by removing her hand from his arms. He really hated it when someone acted clingy with him. But Carla was not just anyone, that&#39;s why he usually took things easy with her. He still viewed her as a child, and with time she would get rid of whatever feeling or thing that was in that head of hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks so much, Nolan, you&#39;re one in a million,&#34; she squealed happily. There was no need for her to pack because she had long done that. She was well prepared for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was her plan all this while, to make him agree to go back to New York with him, then use that as a means to get close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phase one of her plan had already worked out; when she gets to phase two, Nolan would be hers.</p>
