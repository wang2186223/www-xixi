                <p>After freshening up, Layla stepped out from the room as she couldn&#39;t lock herself in forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to come out and face Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over to the sitting room and saw him sitting on a couch with a cup of hot coffee In front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning sir..&#34; she greeted in a low tone picking her nails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to do two things, clear this matter up, if possible she didn&#39;t want them to talk about anything and just forget it happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Secondly, she wanted to seek permission to leave. The business trip was over, so she had no business whatsoever here again in Seattle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she still had to leave immediately as she was still at risk as long as Scarlet and Rosalie were in Seattle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan swayed his head to see her standing there, he just nodded slowly before looking away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he is back to his usual self, Layla snorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um..&#34; she began as she wanted to leave immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to ask&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir let&#39;s talk..&#34; he chimed in and Layla&#39;s brows creased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he still want to talk about last night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh god dammit! The last thing she wanted was for him to speak about it. The fact that she was standing in front of him was a hassle because she was utterly embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Iokay sir.&#34; Layla obliged by taking her seat opposite him as there was no need to argue with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About last night..&#34; he began and Layla blurped loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will take responsibility for what happened, it was my fault..&#34; he uttered softly. Her life was about to take a huge turnaround and she needed to be ready for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has mated with an Alpha which technically meant that she would be a Luna. And that was a huge responsibility to carry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apparently you already know about my real identity..&#34; he sighed, picking up the cup of coffee which was in front of him and he took a sip from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know that I&#39;m a Lycan, you know everything now and you know that we&#39;re mates and we&#39;ve mates..&#34; he paused, dropping the cup back in its original position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla listened with rapt attention as he spoke, she was already prepared to tell him that he could go ahead to reject her. She equally didn&#39;t want to be mates with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I planned to reject you but things didn&#39;t turn out as planned, now we&#39;re inseparable..&#34; he chuckled dryly as he smacked his lips loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can still go ahead with the rejection sir..&#34; Layla reasoned. She did not want him either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t even imagine being with a person like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was handsome, yes but his personality was a big no for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think you understand the meaning of inseparable Layla..&#34; he deadpanned, squinting his eyes at her. She really had a lot to learn about Lycans and werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This new responsibility of a Luna was something she couldn&#39;t ignore. She was entitled to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you reject me, you die or I die, but most times the females lose their lives because they&#39;re more fragile &#34; he stated and Layla felt her heart seize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rejection was much worse than losing one&#39;s mate. When he lost Vera, it took him a long time to bounce back to his real self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now if he rejects Layla, it is most likely that she would lose her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla&#39;s hands trembled as she said those words, he never mentioned death. She can&#39;t die. No!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The mate bond is stronger than you think Layla, I can feel your emotions and you can feel mine, now you&#39;re scared..&#34; he blurted out. He could feel her fear. He didn&#39;t know why she was scared but from now on Layla was his responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need to be scared Layla, I&#39;m not going to bite you. You can live your life however you like, you can live like a free bird&#34; he informed as he had no plans of holding her close to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But there&#39;s something you should know, Layla, I&#39;m not just a Lycan but an Alpha, in other words you can say I rule the Lycans and the werewolves..&#34; she lifted her gaze as she looked at him wondering how him being an Alpha affected her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You now have a responsibility to carry Layla, you&#39;re now my Luna, you now have people under you and their priorities come first..&#34; he intoned the last few words staring intently at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla couldn&#39;t utter any word, she was confused, everything was too much for her to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not rushing you into anything, you can take your time Layla..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just know from now onwards, you&#39;re my responsibility and I&#39;ll handle everything..&#34; he assured and Layla scoffed inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Responsibility her foot! Why didn&#39;t take responsibility for the first night they spent together? Why did he treat her like trash when he met her as if what happened was her fault?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you take responsibility for that night?&#34; She was forced to ask him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because whatever happened that night was nothing but a mistake.&#34; He spat out bluntly and Layla felt her heart squeeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her child is not a mistake, this pregnancy is one of the best things that could ever happen to her as she found a new reason to be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was never meant to happen..&#34; he said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that night, he began to live in guilt and hated himself so much. He hated the moon goddess for giving him a second chance mate when she took the one he loved away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hated Layla to the core for even appearing in his Life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A mistake..&#34; Layla repeated in ridicule as she stood on her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he considered that night a mistake, then he would consider her pregnancy a mistake and wouldn&#39;t accept it. Then what was the need of telling him about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can take good care of myself, there&#39;s no need to take responsibility for anything..&#34; she said angrily walking away from him as she walked into a room slamming the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words pissed her a lot. She had never been this angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan pursed his lips as he watched her leave, what did he say that made her so angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up from the chair, he headed to her room as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going to the pack soon, get ready&#34; and with that he walked away.</p>
