                <p>Layla sat opposite Nolan as she waited for him to state out the rules he had for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her gaze on the ground as she felt very uneasy around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm&#34; he cleared his throat, gaining Layla&#39;s attention and she looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know none of us want to be in this situation where we have found ourselves but since it has already happened, we just have to adapt to it..&#34; he began in a deep monotone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already know what is going on and the responsibility you have to bear now..&#34; he added and Layla shook her head before raising her hand timidly in the air, as she wanted to ask a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on..&#34; he motioned for her to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there nothing we can do about this?&#34; She questioned. She really wanted to go very far away from him but that would not be possible if she beared his so called mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mark was still visible on her neck and she saw it whenever she was having her bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also she had a hard time trying to hide the mark so she usually applied make-up as her short hair couldn&#39;t do any justice in hiding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean to sever the mate bond there must be something we can do right?&#34; She grilled gulping down loudly as he fixed his ivy blue eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; came his concise reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing we can do, unless you want to lose your life, of course..&#34; he smirked as Layla stiffened. When did lives become involved with this? She thought in alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Accept your fate Layla..&#34; he uttered, taking in a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had long accepted his fate. It had already happened and there was nothing more he could do about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She will be the pack Luna but not his Luna. Because although he had accepted this as his date, he will never accept Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;II&#34; Layla began but paused as her mouth suddenly went dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had nothing to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back to the rules&#34; he braced himself up, Layla doing same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rule number one&#34; Layla fidgeted as he paused looking directly at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he looked at her made her feel uncomfortable, she didn&#39;t like it one bit. It felt as if he was up to no good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re expected to be at this house, maximum 7pm..&#34; he stated and Layla froze in horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he seriously kidding her!! He was setting a damn curfew for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t get you, Imean 7pm!!!&#34; She shrieked in surprise. She was an adult not his pawn or whatsoever. What if she had something important to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>7pm!! Layla scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t try me Layla..&#34; he warned in a cold steel voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you perchance go somewhere you should be back before 7pm..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try me and come to this house past your curfew time..&#34; he uttered softly, looking calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Layla knew that nothing good was going on in that head of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would definitely do something terrible to her if she broke any other of his rules or if she even dated to argue with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay Mr Adlen..&#34; she mumbled softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Moving on&#34; his lips curved up as he continued</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rule number two!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay away from me!!&#34; There was another hinge of warning in his voice as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should live like total strangers in this house, you get it?&#34; He asked and Layla nodded. She has no plans in going near him either. The second rule was perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll get everything you want, money, clothes, everything&#34; he deadpanned, bringing out a card out from his pocket and he dropped it on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This card has no limit..&#34; he informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can get whatever you want..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No thank you, I don&#39;t need it&#34; Layla politely refused. She did not need his money. She was content the way she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me you&#39;ll need it..&#34; he said leaving the card on the table as he had to intentions of taking it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rule number three..&#34; Layla held her breath in anticipation for the next rule. Her heart jumped each time she heard him say the word rule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one at the office should know we live together..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noted..&#34; she forced out a smile at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, she became intrigued to ask a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me..&#34; she began in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you desperately want us to live as strangers, don&#39;t you think it would be better if we lived separately? I can leave if you want..&#34; she suggested, eager to leave his place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you can&#39;t..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I said, I&#39;m only here to wrap things up before returning to the pack and you&#39;ll be coming with me..&#34; there were a few things he wanted to avoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I see no&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rule number four..&#34; he says out loud interrupting Layla from saying anything further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dare breaking my rules and you would get the worst punishments ever..&#34; he deadpanned picking up his phone from the couch lazily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll begin your driving lessons during the weekends&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay sir&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That will be all for now..&#34; he uttered with a passive look on his face as he stood up from the chair walking towards his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddox followed behind him obediently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla let out a deep breath as she slumped against the chair the moment he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence was definitely intimidating. So intimidating that she felt as if she would pass out any minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even show her to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She guessed that was her job. She stood up from the chair dragging her feet to one of the rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked inside, locking the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around the huge room which was furnished to a woman&#39;s taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems her guess was right. This was her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the dressing table were women&#39;s cosmetics. Expensive ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found her way to the closet as she gasped at the sight before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was starkly full of clothes, shoes, slides, bags, and jewelry which were obviously meant for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Nolan really have to go this far, because none of this was necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving her a black card, changing her wardrobe. She wanted none of it. What she wanted was to go as far away from him as possible.</p>
