                <p>Layla kept glancing from side to side in panic, not knowing what to do or say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Nolan doing in Seattle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She can&#39;t go there. That was the place where her worst nightmares resided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosalie, Scarlet and Mike. At least he should have told her so she would prefer herself for this journey Incase anything happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world is such a small place. What if she comes across Scarlet who knows about her pregnancy and then Scarlet meets Nolan. Scarlet being a person that blabs a lot will tell Nolan about her pregnancy, what then will happen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Will Nolan deny her? What if he tells her to abort it? What if scarlet does something stupid if they come across each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot of what if&#39;s rang through her head and Layla became scared as hell that she unconsciously began to hold her tummy tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was beginning to sweat a lot and anyone who would see her would think that she was in a sort of dilemma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well she was, she was not supposed to be seen or go to Seattle, a place where all her enemies reside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan began to notice Layla&#39;s strange behaviors and he glanced at her, trying to read if anything was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was clutching her stomach tight and it looked as if she was in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to ask if everything was alright, when his eyes caught something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pupils dilated the moment his eyes saw that, her first three buttons were undone and he could see her cleavages from where she sat, A clear view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to look away but couldn&#39;t, his carnal desires resurfacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything that happened that night immediately came flooding back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her flawless skin that was spotless but burned bright red when he touched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her soft moulds that fitted perfectly in his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those sounds she made each time he went in and out of her, those cried, they all came flooding back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something he had tried so hard to forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he wanted to grab her and fuck her right now to fill the vacuum that she had left empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan clenched his fist as he tried controlling himself to keep his inner beast at bay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Layla was portraying what could happen in Seattle, Nolan was trying to control his carnal desires until he finally managed to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to seduce me?&#34; He asked in a deep velvety voice withheld a hint of mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Layla gasped, snapping out of her daze as she turned to face him. She noticed that he was staring intently at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to seduce me?&#34; He asked again as Layla frowned wondering what he was driving at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes traveled down to her exposed cleavages and Layla looked down also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gosh&#34; she gasped as her face instantly turned bright red, she quickly buttoned up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was in so much hurry that she forgot to button her blouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only that, she usually wore a singlet inside her blouse, but today she totally forgot to do so, because of the hurry she used in getting ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good girl&#34; Nolan&#39;s low voice vibrated as he looked away from her, he grabbed a bottle of water, gulping it down. But that didn&#39;t help at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla being in the same car as him suddenly felt suffocating for him, he needed some air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled off his tie and he unbuttoned the first two buttons, but that did not help at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roll down the glass&#34; he instructed and the driver rolled the glass allowing fresh air to enter the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn you&#34; Nolan cursed under his breath, looking outside the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla and Nolan arrived at the hotel they were going to stay at during his business trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla tried all she could to avoid being seen by anyone she knows, anybody from her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily for her Nolan was lodging at a five star hotel, so she was pretty sure scarlet would not be seen around here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To book a room here was very expensive and was for the rich business men. So Layla was quite relaxed, the chances of meeting scarlet were low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good day sir&#34; the receptionist greeted, as Layla and Nolan stopped in front of the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Book me two rooms, we&#39;re going to be staying for two days&#34; he requested as Layla sighed. In relief, they&#39;re only staying for three days. She could cope with that and do her best to avoid her nemesis here in Seattle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry sir, only a room is available in the golden suite, I can book for a normal room if you want&#34; she suggested waiting for Nolan&#39;s reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan jaw worked as he took a glance at Layla who was standing quietly beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way he was going to book a normal suite and stay there and he did not want Layla to stay too far from him, she was very clumsy and was prior to making a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought hard and carefully for a long time before he finally spoke out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll take a room&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright sir&#34; Layla turned her head sharply to face him, what did he mean by they would take a room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she going to survive three nights with him in the same room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#34; Nolan gave his card to the receptionist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit&#34; Layla wanted to protest, but with my hard glare from him, she clasped her mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s your key card&#34; the receptionist gave Nolan the key card together with his card and Nolan walked away from the counter as he headed to the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The room is very big and there&#39;s a lot of space for you to stay away, &#39;&#39; he said as the both of them got into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla frowned her face, the idea of sharing a room with him, not sitting well with her, she was fully aware that the room was going to be huge, but sharing a room with him, was a big No. Will they share a bed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take the bed, you take the couch&#34; he voiced out as if he read her thoughts, Layla could not do anything but scrunch her face in annoyance. How will she sleep on a freaking couch!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should have just booked a separate room for her instead, she was more than okay staying in a normal suite, what the fuck is going through that head of his?</p>
