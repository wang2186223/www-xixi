                <p>&#34;We need to leave now&#34; Nolan announced standing up on his feet as Layla did the same wondering what must have come up that made him want to leave all of a sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Alden!&#34; Hayes called in surprise as he stood up also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have somewhere very important to go to, you can come see me in my office&#34; Nolan said holding Layla by her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as he was concerned this place was not safe. Hayes was up to no good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Mr Alden&#34; Hayes chuckled dryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just came here, at least sit and talk&#34; he tried to persuade Nolan. But Nolan&#39;s mind was already made up. This place was not safe for Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayes was a werewolf and his men would definitely be werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re leaving&#34; Nolan says with a note of finality and he took a hold of Layla&#39;s hand and they both began to work away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was almost halfway through the door when a loud gunshot was heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla flinched as she held Nolan tighter at the sound of the gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gritted his teeth in anger, he knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His intuition was right after all, Hayes was up to no good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned slowly as Layla held his hand tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both turned to see Hayes smiling wickedly with a gun in his hand which he used to shoot the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I finally got you today Alpha..&#34; he began in sarcasm clicking his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla frowned in confusion as she wondered who Hayes was calling an Alpha. From the way Nolan fumed in anger, she was sure a fight would break out soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always act like you&#39;re on top of the world, acting all rude and nonchalant, but you see today, I&#39;ll make sure you go down on your knees and worship me. I&#39;ll show the whole of your pack that their favorite Lycan bowed before a mere werewolf&#34; Hayes laughed out sardonically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan frowned immediately when he heard that, now he knew where all those were coming from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayes was just one of the werewolves who thought that they were supposed to rule, not the Lycans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you can kill me huh?&#34; He scoffed as Layla glanced sharply at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she wondered why he was still looking unbothered when Hayes obviously outnumbered him. His men were armed, they all held a gun while Nolan held nothing. He should be negotiating for his life and her life, not acting pompous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s very hard to kill Alpha, because you&#39;re the supreme Alpha, a Lycan, but you know what, I came prepared &#34; he smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of the bullets in the guns contain wolfsbane, so about ten bullets will be enough to weaken you, then I&#39;ll make you beg for your life!&#34; Hayes snarled. He had always wanted the werewolf to have their own say, he wanted the werewolves to be the supreme leader not the Lycans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he can only achieve that by killing the Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla began to shake In fear, not only was her life in danger, Hayes was also saying things that she didn&#39;t seem to understand, what the hell was a wolfbane? And who in the world will ten bullets just weaken, not kill?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Si.r..&#34; Layla stammered shakily tugging his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move&#34; he whispered to her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move and stay close to me, we&#39;ve been ambushed but don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t let anything happen to you&#34; he assured. Layla was now his priority and if there was any reason for him to be worried it would be her, she was not safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla shook her head slowly, wondering if those words just came out from his mouth. Did he just say that he would protect her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well he should, because the life of her baby was now at risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re surrounded Alpha, if you even take a step my men will shoot&#34; Hayes threatened as Nolan smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can try&#34; he uttered and before Hayes could retort back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was already in front of one of his men as he held his gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now this is one of the advantages of being a Lycan king, Hayes, speed.&#34; He deadpanned and Layla who was still in horror at how he moved so fast was encompassed with another shock when claws suddenly grew out from Nolan&#39;s finger tearing through the glove he wore and the next moment, blood was sprawled everywhere as man&#39;s lifeless body fell on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha!!&#34; Layla shrieked in fear and shock. What just happened? Did Nolan just use his hands, no claws, no fingers, no. Layla&#39;s mind was in a turmoil at what was unfolding before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s next?&#34; He asked in a calm time still holding Layla very tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Nolan, you think you&#39;re smart? I&#39;ll see if you&#39;re faster than my men guns&#34;Hayes scoffed, signaling his men to start shooting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, bullets began to rain in the room and Nolan kept moving with a frozen Layla trying to shield her as he hid in the pillars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look Layla I want you to do something &#34; he began as they hid behind a pillar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to save your life, you have to get this off your mind for now&#34; he said, showing her his bloodied hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to drop you at some point, once I drop you there, you run straight out of this place, run to a safe place and wait till I come out&#34; he instructed as Layla shook her head shakily, she needed to leave for the same if her baby, but what about Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about you sir? We should call the cop&#34; she suggested, Hayes should get arrested for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The cops can&#39;t do anything Layla, just do what I tell you to do and keep yourself safe&#34; he said to her running to the next pillar. He kept on moving from pillar to pillar as he dropped Layla on the last one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go now&#34; he uttered, releasing her from his hold as he brought out a gun from his pocket, he had collected the gun from the man he killed earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok sir&#34; Layla stuttered as Layla moved away from her immediately, shooting one of the bad guys who fell instantly on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan began to fight them off, killing anyone he laid his hands on as he ripped their throats out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They could never be a match to him, Hayes just underestimated his strength, up until now, not a single bullet has touched him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was still running out when she tripped in her heels resulting in a fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arrhh&#34; Layla winced in pain diverting Nolan&#39;s attention as he quickly turned to face her.</p>
