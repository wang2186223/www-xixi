                <p>&#34;Come on..&#34; Keisha led Layla into a dark room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Alpha is inside..&#34; she giggled and Layla rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha her foot!. They were just mates by name, there was nothing special between them as long as she was concerned. Nolan didn&#39;t want her nor did she want him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she wanted to do now was to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Run to a place where no one will ever find her and raise her baby herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha&#34; Keisha called as soon they got to where Nolan was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of him was Hayes bound in chains, a man Layla had never met and Carla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Nolan asked, turning away from Hayes, who was seated on the ground with a bloodied face. It was evident that he had been tortured a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you bring Layla here?&#34; He asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought it would be okay if I brought her along..&#34; Keisha explained and Nolan stared long at Layla before looking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, Layla didn&#39;t want to be there either. She felt uncomfortable, the stench, the sight of blood on Hayes, irritated her and she felt like puking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only that, she was feeling weak and worn out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to visit the hospital to have a check up. She hadn&#39;t visited the hospital till she discovered she was pregnant and that was about two months ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s she?&#34; Hayes coughed out blood as his gaze traveled to Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought humans weren&#39;t allowed here in the pack, why did you bring her, unless she&#39;s someone special to you..&#34; Hayes snorted weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His plan had failed, none was accomplished and the trap he set for Nolan, didn&#39;t work out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he drugged him, he had plans for Nolan. But when he saw that Nolan was killing his men, he wanted to kill Layla instead, so there wouldn&#39;t be a way out for Nolan when the drug started taking effect as it was night time and no one would be around. But none of his plans worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess you both had a steamy night, right?&#34; His smirk as Layla shifted uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at how tired she looks, you&#39;re definitely a bad Alpha..&#34; he drew out laughing loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla felt like walking over to Hayes and giving him a hot slap across his cheeks, so he would shut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was uttering rubbish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reminding her of what she was trying so hard to forget. Last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything that happened last night she was trying so hard to forget it and pretend as if nothing ever happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How Nolan&#39;s hands felt on her, his tongue down there, the words he said to her. She wanted to forget it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Nolan snarled, gripping Hayes&#39; neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need to get worked up about it all, the drug I used on you is very potent and she was the only woman with you, we&#39;re all adults here, you definitely had a longnight.&#34; He deadpanned in sarcasm as his eyes traveled to Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s even wearing your clothes..&#34; he laughed and Carla clenched her fist tight in anger. She swore to make Layla miserable, she would regret ever coming into Nolan&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mind his words Layla, he&#39;s a psychopath..&#34; Keisha assured and Layla shook her head slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure he loses his tongue..&#34; Nolan instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you killing him?&#34; Darren asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet .&#34; Nolan replied, removing his hands from Hayes&#39; neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going? I have a request to make..&#34; Hayes began mischievously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should at least have a taste of her, what do you think?&#34; Hayes raised a brow at Nolan as his eyes raked Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s very pretty, how come I didn&#39;t notice her last night, I would have made sure to kidnap her..&#34; he said meaningfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know what I&#39;ll do to her if I kidnap her?&#34; He queried annoyingly. Nolan who was still squatting in front of him fought so hard to not to kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take her and do a lot of things to her, a lot..&#34; he emphasized his eyes still on Layla who was beginning to shift uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No doubt, Hayes was disgusting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A lot more than whatever you did to her last night, trust me darling, I&#39;m far better than him..&#34; he laughed hysterically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His plan had failed, he had been marked a traitor, Nolan would definitely kill him in the future, because there was no way nan would spare him for what he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can try if you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!!&#34; Nolan growled, punching him right through the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dare he say such dirty things about Layla?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You broke my nose..&#34; Hayes spat out blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your bones are next..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But before that, can I have her?&#34; Hayes pointed at Layla. No doubt, she was very beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know she&#39;s a whore you probably picked up and would..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said shut up!!&#34; Nolan uttered softly. Hayes really got the nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And she is not a whore like your mother..&#34; he spat scornfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok please, Alpha, enough of these, just one night..&#34; he demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least fulfill that wish, take it as my dying wish as a once respected werewolf &#34; he requested shamelessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would love to run my hands through that Milky skin of hers and feel her, it&#39;d be fun to have a taste of what the Alpha had tasted, I&#39;m sure those bre&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goddamn you!!&#34; Nolan mouthed and the next second he had already snapped out his fangs and he began to claw Hayes angrily, ripping his throat out as blood sprawled everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn you&#34; he cursed standing up on his feet as Hayes body fell on the ground lifelessly. He died like a chicken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan wasn&#39;t planning on killing him just yet, but he couldn&#39;t bear hearing Hayes say such rubbish about Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla stood still as she watched Nolan covered in blood, she suddenly began to feel more irritated, feeling the urge to puke. She was feeling lightheaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla are you okay?&#34; Keisha asked, sensing her discomfort. She could tell she was uncomfortable from her body movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;m not&#34; she stammered feeling an unsettling feeling at the depths of her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to visit the bathroom..&#34; she managed to utter as the lump forming on her throat was threatening to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me, I&#39;ll take you there..&#34; Keisha offered and she immediately took Layla out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clean the mess up..&#34; Nolan instructed leaving as well.</p>
