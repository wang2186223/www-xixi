                <p>Layla lifted her head slowly from Nolan&#39;s chest as she blinked her eyes repeatedly, her face met with Nolan&#39;s who was calmly asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arms were tightly wrapped around her bare waist as she sat on top of him straddling him while Nolan sat on the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face immediately flushed red as she remembered the events that happened just about an hour ago. How hard and insanely Nolan drove in and out of her and how ke kept on calling her beautiful and hot repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had fallen asleep after that as she did the same afterwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea what must have gotten into Nolan, but right now he looked so peaceful and calm. She couldn&#39;t help but admire his beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also marveled how aan could be so good looking like Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact the lycans she had met were very handsome, starting from Nolan, down to Xander and the man she met at the pack. They were all so good looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla kept on staring at his flawless face for a.long time, she didn&#39;t want to look away, she wanted to drown in his beauty forever. The father of her child was no doubt handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dark red hair suited him perfectly especially when it was falling on his forehead just like now, then his cold blue eyes which could bore holes into a person&#39;s soul was so magnificent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla became tempted to touch his flawless face and run her finger through it. She fought so hard to fight the urge to do so and when she couldn&#39;t hold any anymore, she touched his face slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt an electric jolt go round her body down to that spot. That&#39;s when realization hit Layla as her eyes opened wide in horror. He was still inside her. F*ck! He didn&#39;t pull out of her yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was still in a daze when his eyes suddenly snapped open bearing bright red in color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; He asked in a low deep voice which seemed to want to drive Layla insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;II&#34; Layla stammered as she quickly jolted her hand back from his face. His red eyes stared intently at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, I&#39;m doing nothing..&#34; she replied, forcing out a smile. Now that he was awake she felt extremely shy and embarrassed, she wanted to get out of the office as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s about time we leave?&#34; She questioned diverting the topic.From the look of things it was already night time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we should..&#34; Nolan replied, creasing his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His deep seductive voice seemed to have turned Layla on again as she immediately turned wet down there which in turn aroused Nolan who was still inside her as he grew hard feeling her insides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you scared?&#34; He suddenly asked and Layla brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My eyes..&#34; he responded, speaking in a very low voice. He had let his wolf take control and dominated his mate, now he was still in his Lycan form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No..&#34; Layla confessed. What was there to be scared about? This was not the first time she had seen his red eyes. She had seen him grow fangs and claws before. She witnessed him shredding a person to pieces then why would she be scared of him now. She surprisingly found warmth in his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not scared.&#34; She said again and Nolan&#39;s eyes held a look of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly Nolan..&#34; she began taking a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I actually find warmth with you..&#34; she confessed softly as Nolan&#39;s eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because we&#39;re mates but each time I&#39;m with you, it feels like home..&#34; she uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still remember the first time we met, you were the first person to tell me after so many years that I was not useless and that what my father did was not my fault. I felt so elated that night&#34; she said, remembering the first day she met Nolan. He was surprisingly calm and cool then when they met again he just changed and directed nothing but hatred towards her as if she&#39;d done something very gravely to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know why all of that changed..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you leave home?&#34; He abruptly asked the question that has been bothering him since day why. Why did Layla leave home to come here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Layla felt her words stuck in her throat as she searched for the perfect lie to tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I left home because I couldn&#39;t bear the pain of the breakup, after my boyfriend cheated on me with my sister, I couldn&#39;t take it, so I left home..&#34; she said softly trying to keep a calm facade as Nolan fixed his gaze on her. Something felt different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why do you feel different?&#34; He asked as Layla&#39;s brows narrowed in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your bre. forget it..&#34; he waved that thought off thinking it wasn&#39;t necessary at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should get going..&#34; he said, helping her climb off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here, clean yourself up and get dressed..&#34; he threw a napkin at Layla and they both cleaned up and got ready to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan..&#34; Layla called softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; He questioned picking up his car keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something I wanted to tell you..&#34; she began picking her nails nervously as something kept pushing her to tell Nolan about her pregnancy sooner or later he would find out about it once he started perceiving his pups on her, she felt it would be better if she told him now so as to avoid unnecessary issues in the future. Everyone knew how angry Nolan could get and he acted out of it whenever he was angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can tell me when we get he, we&#39;re running late..&#34; he said making way for the door as Layla pursed her lips. She&#39;d just tell him when they get home. She hoped silently for everything to go well, there would be no hassles or whatsoever.</p>
