                <p>For the first time in his life, Nolan was stunned. That was a very bold step that she took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just voluntarily placed herself into a pit of fire.</p>

                <p>His lips curved up and he scoffed inwardly, his icy blue eyes staring wickedly at her.</p>

                <p>&#34;That&#39;s up for me to decide&#34; Layla said in a shaky voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she marveled on how brave she had become overnight. Why was she even doing this, offering herself to the devil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re adults sir, let&#39;s just get on with this and forget it ever happened, it&#39;s just to help you&#34; she sounded trying to convince herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might get paralyzed before he even found a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just so you know, there&#39;s no backing out..&#34; he growled circling his arm around her waist the next second as he drew her close to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla straightened herself up as she knelt on the ground beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He yanked her neck from behind and crashed his lips on hers then he suddenly let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not know how she managed to say that right to his face or even kiss him but it was the last thing she was bothered about right now. Because even with the undeniable desire and lust and need in his eyes, this man could still hold himself back, to deny himself of what he fiercely wanted. Just how strong was his damned self-control?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew better than anyone else. That Nolan Adlen was the epitome of self-control. It would not be far-fetched to even say that he coined that term. The whole world may crash and burn but he still managed to stay calm and collected. But it was a little hard for her to believe that even if he was obviously burning himself from the fire that was consuming him, he still had managed to this man, she now knew the extent of what he truly was. He was more than what she had ever seen or known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it were some other men, her gown would have probably been rippled to pieces already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t want to do it together then let&#39;s stop here.&#34; Layla said, she did not even try to conceal the hurt in her voice. Yes, she could not help but feel hurt because she had realized that she was indirectly rejected. Other men would seize this opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he hate her that much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Retracting her hands, Layla forced an understanding smile at him before scooting back from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he caught her ankles as she was almost out of reach from him and in one swift move, he pulled her back to where she was a moment ago, under him. He was growling as he cursed and spoke in a voice so deliciously heart breaking, &#34;Don&#39;t make me do this&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he bent down and kissed her mouth with savagery. As if he was trying to convey to her how much he wanted her. A groan was still rumbling in his chest as he devoured her mouth with an increased level of ferocity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already way past midnight, the full moon shining brightly upon the face of the earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streets were quiet with no one around, as the silent breeze blew peacefully. Inside one of the houses, were two people who allowed themselves to get drowned in the stream of pleasure that flooded them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gasp escaped from Layla&#39;s lips when Nolan squeezed one of her bottom cheek that sent a jolt right between her legs. Her heart sped with the way his blue eyes began to flicker, changing from blue to red, from time to time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening to your eyes?&#34; Layla asked, breaking off from the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, it will return back to its usual colors soon..&#34; he said, placing his hands at the side of her face, caressing her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like to be the listener... to hear every cry and gasp, moan and sighs that will tumble from your lips,&#34; he suddenly blurted out, if Nolan&#39;s actions and earlier words didn&#39;t seduce her, it did now. He pulled her close and kissed her on her lips again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla let herself be devoured by Simon for a few seconds before she tried to take reigns to kiss him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His soft lips tasted so good and they way he kissed her, one would think he was a pro in this Field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was not her first kiss, Mike was but Mike&#39;s kiss was nothing compared to Nolan&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just so good at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both battled each other with their lips and tongue and Nolan soon began to run his hands through her body, reaching out for her intimate parts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed his hands on the hem of her dress and he folded it up to her waist level. Now that her panties were open before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla suddenly became nervous, this was kind of new to her. Especially before a man like Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first night they spent was nothing compared to this. Then she was drunk and hardly remembered anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you thinking of backing out?&#34; He smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m not&#34; Layla retorted and she leaned over to possess his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nervousness that she had earlier appeared had now disappeared. She wanted to show Nolan that she was brave as she would always keep to her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt him nip her bottom lip, and she sent a quiet glare when she noticed the smile on his lips. When they kissed back, she sucked his bottom lips hard, and she bit into it, but not enough to draw blood from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing his hands on her hips, he lifted her off the ground and made her sit on his laps, in a way that she straddled him as they continued kissing each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was definitely going to be a long one as each of their monsters has been released from its cage, leaving them untamed.</p>
