                <p>Nolan was not comfortable with himself the moment Layla stepped out of the house; his inner man was troubled, and he fought so hard with himself to keep calm. But he became more uncomfortable when the rain started pouring down heavily. Based on the kind of environment he lived in, he was fully aware that there was no way she would find a taxi at this time of night, so she would probably be drenched under the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately began to regret why he sent her off without any protection; what if something bad happened to her? His wolf immediately turned restless, wanting to come out of him to find its mate. That&#39;s when he drove out immediately in a bid to find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Si..r,&#34; Layla muttered with her teeth chattering due to the cold as she managed to stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing in the rain?&#34; Nolan asked as he was getting angry for no reason; it kind of hurt seeing her drenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t find a taxi,&#34; she responded, wiping off the water droplets from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have called someone,&#34; he deadpanned. Who in the world gets themselves wet without asking for help?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My battery died,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have this,&#34; he said, holding her hand up as he placed the umbrella he was holding between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; he beckoned to her, walking towards his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you coming?&#34; He questioned, stopping at his car door as she was still standing there like a statue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get into the car,&#34; he instructed, and Layla slowly moved her feet. If not for her pregnancy, heaven knows nothing would have made her go with him; he was responsible for the mess she was in, in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slowly got into the car, sitting in the front seat. &#34;Oh god,&#34; Layla uttered in fear; his car was getting wet from the water dripping from her wet clothes, so she was scared he would flare up at her and tell her to get out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Use this to dry yourself,&#34; he threw a thick blanket on her lap, and he turned the heater on in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Than&#34; he never gave Layla the chance to finish thanking him as he drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla slowly wrapped the blanket around her body, and she slowly began to feel warm again. &#34;Where are we going, sir?&#34; She asked, seeing he was not going towards the direction of the highway but to his place instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My house,&#34; came his curt reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!!&#34; Layla exclaimed despite the cold she was feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think I&#39;m going to drive you home in this weather condition and by this time of the night?&#34; he scoffed; he never planned on taking her to her house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But..&#34; Layla began, but a glare from him was enough to shut her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the ride was quiet as they soon arrived at his penthouse. They both stepped out of the car, and it was still raining heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir,&#34; Layla called, wanting to give his umbrella to him, but he only ignored her as he walked away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe he does not want to share, same here with me,&#34; Layla shrugged her shoulders walking into his apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can sleep in any of the rooms available,&#34; he instructed, drying his hair with a towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make yourself comfortable, and don&#39;t worry about Maddox; he&#39;ll stay very far away from you,&#34; he informed, and Layla breathed out in relief. She hated dogs; those annoying fur animals irked her a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything else you need?&#34; He asked as their eyes met. Layla found herself drooling at his beauty; a few wet strands of his hair fell on his forehead, making him look marvelous. He looked more handsome and cute now he was in casual clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I do,&#34; she responded. She needed to get to Aurora and tell her she was fine; secondly, she was starving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to charge my phone,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can find any extension cord to use.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, I&#39;m hungry,&#34; she mouthed. She would have loved to sleep without eating anything, but she did not have lunch before, and her stomach has been grumbling, begging for food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make yourself something to eat,&#34; he phased out, walking away from her, and he went straight to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jerk,&#34; Layla cursed, watching him walk away. She took a look at her clothes, which were still wet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dammit, how did I go about this?&#34; She asked herself. How will she cook or even sleep with wet clothes? She was still deep in her thoughts when Nolan approached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need anything, sir?&#34; She asked quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have this,&#34; he stretched his hand forward, handing over some clothes to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir!!&#34; Layla shrieked in surprise. Was he seriously offering her his clothes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might get sick if you keep on wearing wet clothes; use this instead,&#34; he advised, and Layla accepted the clothes; she needed it anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, si&#34; she didn&#39;t get to finish yet still as he walked away, banging his door loudly immediately he went into his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla took a look at the clothes in her hands; it was a thick sweater and a cotton knicker. They were both made of cotton; in fact, the clothes belonged to him because they smelled nice like him. He had this spicy smell that sent butterflies to her stomach each time she inhaled him. If there was one thing about him that distracted her a lot, it was his nice smell and handsomeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla hastily rushed into one of the rooms to have a hot shower; luckily for her, she found a charger, and she quickly charged her phone. She needed to get through to Aurora before doing anything else; her friend would be more than worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About two minutes later, her phone switched on, and she immediately went to the contact list and dialed Aurora&#39;s number. After one ring, Aurora picked up the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Aurora, how-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the hell are you!!!!?&#34;</p>
