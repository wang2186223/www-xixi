                <p>&#34;Nolan&#34; Xander called in a low voice as he walked into Nolan&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you want?&#34; Nolan snapped, anger clearly evident in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chill, man. What&#39;s up with all the anger?&#34; Xander teased, taking his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So tell me, what was the cause of your behavior earlier today?&#34; Xander questioned curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you employ her before telling me?&#34; Nolan gritted his teeth with clenched fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you said you didn&#39;t care, and I can employ anyone,&#34; Xander raised a brow at Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with her? You never spared a glance at your past secretaries, but it seems this one is getting you all worked up,&#34; Xander reasoned. Nolan was a kind of person who never gave a damn; he was fine as long as things went his way. That was one of the main reasons why his secretaries never stayed more than a month because he always found problems with them, and he was not the type to give second chances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s the one,&#34; Nolan said after much hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which one?&#34; Xander pursed his lips as he thought hard on what Nolan was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, your mate?&#34; He pointed out, and the look on Nolan&#39;s face confirmed it. They were mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s your mate, isn&#39;t she?&#34; Xander asked Nolan, who had long looked away from him, trying to focus his attention on a file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is not,&#34; he snapped coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, yes, she is. She&#39;s the one you met when you went on a trip to Seattle, the reason for your restlessness and your ferociousness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mate died a long time ago,&#34; Nolan retorted venomously, and the pen he was holding snapped in two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A long time ago, Nolan,&#34; Xander reminded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you don&#39;t want to believe it, but it&#39;s time you move on from the shackles of sadness holding you back. That&#39;s why the moon goddess probably decided to give you a second chance, mate,&#34; Xander says but only received a glare from Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not having this conversation again or I might forget that you&#39;re my best friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan Alden was the Alpha of the enchanted moon pack, the most feared amongst Lycans and werewolves; he was also the most feared among humans. His mate Vera died a long time ago during the war between werewolves and lycans, and since that incident, he became a shadow of his former self. Cold, hostile, wicked, unforgiving, everyone feared him and stayed far away from him. His heart turned dark when he lost his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Reject her,&#34; Xander suggested as Nolan lifted his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t want her, reject her,&#34; Xander shrugged his shoulders as Nolan&#39;s jaw worked. Xander noticed Nolan&#39;s blue eyes turning red, and he could guess what was happening; Nolan was fighting against his wolf. His wolf wanted his mate, but he didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After struggling with his wolf for some time, he opened his eyes and said, &#34;I will reject her.&#34; After what happened back in Seattle, he hated himself; he was driven by the mate bond to do what he did, coupled with the influence of alcohol. Not only did he hate himself, but he also hated Layla for ever approaching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you mean it?&#34; Xander asked in bewilderment; he thought Nolan was not going to take him seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t bluff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear today is the most awful day of my life,&#34; Layla frowned as she explained everything that happened in the office to Aurora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to see the way he looked at me, the fire in his eyes; for a moment, I felt like trash,&#34; Layla said. She really felt disgusted at herself. Not only that, he sent chills down her spine; he looked so scary and dangerous, like he badly wanted to kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down, I&#39;m sure he will reason with you once he finds out you are pregnant for him,&#34; Aurora reasoned, and Layla glanced at her before suddenly bursting into a dry laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still don&#39;t get it, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He hates me,&#34; Layla deadpanned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From the way he looked at me, you&#39;ll definitely know that he regrets ever meeting me; he pinned me to the wall, Aurora, he almost choked me to death. What&#39;s my crime? It&#39;s not as if I seduced him to have sex with me,&#34; Layla uttered in frustration. Working with a person like him will be a great hassle. She would have loved to quit, but finding another good paying job will be a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why you should tell him you&#39;re pregnant with his child. Look, Layla, men love having kids; it will be like a dream come true for him,&#34; Aurora tried to convince Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That word does not apply to my boss,&#34; Layla chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you ever met him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone fears him in the office and maintains a safe distance; he did not even welcome me on my first day. What am I even saying? He almost killed me!!&#34; Layla shrieked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you should tell him still,&#34; Aurora tried to convince Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He thinks I&#39;m a gold digger, that I probably came for his money, so what do you think he will say if I tell him about this? He&#39;ll kill me,&#34; Layla drew out. She had concluded not to tell him anything and just stop working when the time comes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know your reason for this, but I still think he deserves to know, but if you&#39;re not comfortable with that, fine by me, you still have my full support,&#34; Aurora assured, smiling at Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; Layla mumbled, hugging Aurora. Settling in has been so stressful, but she&#39;ll do just fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what do you plan on doing now?&#34; Aurora questioned as Layla pursed her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What will you do now you&#39;re working under the father of your unborn child, how do you cope?&#34; Aurora asked, sounding worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Simple, ignore him, act like he doesn&#39;t exist, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll do just fine,&#34; Layla replied. That would be so easy for her to do; besides, she hated him.</p>
