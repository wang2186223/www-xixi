                <p>He has requested that no one disturbed him as he needed some time to think and look for ways to set things straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it seemed like that wouldn&#39;t be possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you all doing here?&#34; He snarled In a menacing tone as Carla stepped away from where she was standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla&#39;s sick&#34; Keisha blurted out and Carla shot a hard glare at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sick..&#34; Nolan repeatedly took a look at Layla who was standing timidly behind Keisha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I don&#39;t think she&#39;s feeling well..&#34; Keisha informed and Nolan&#39;s brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must have gone so hard on her the previous night that she even fell sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the big deal about it?&#34; Carla chuckled butting in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla can take good care of herself and Nolan needs some rest also, come on Layla I&#39;ll take you to a guest room..&#34; she offered an attempt to hold Layla&#39;s hand but was stopped by Nolan right in time as his deep baritone voice rang in their ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need, I&#39;ll take care of this myself..&#34; he said, holding Layla&#39;s wrist. He could feel her temperature and it was kind of high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34; Carla stammered in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can leave..&#34; he snapped and Carla bit her lips in frustration before walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take care of her please..&#34; Keisha pleaded leaving as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you definitely came into my life to trouble me..&#34; he said after Keisha and Carla were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not troubling you..&#34; Layla mouthed weakly. Her head was spinning, she needed rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are, trouble keeps recurring in my life right from the day we met..&#34; he bluntly said and Layla inhaled deeply. This was not the first time he was speaking so harshly to her. He had called her useless before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not asking for all of these..&#34; she pointed out. She didn&#39;t want to be a Luna, she didn&#39;t want to be here. She left New York to come here thinking she would be free, but she found herself in another trouble instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to be a Luna, I don&#39;t want anything to do with you Lycans, please let me go..&#34; she muttered as she struggled to get out of his hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You called for this yourself..&#34; he stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here..&#34; then he suddenly dragged her into his study room banging the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want with me?&#34; She asked, feeling his hard glare on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want nothing from you Layla but wish you never came into my life..&#34; he said in a single breath as Layla looked downwards, facing the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let me go..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I could..&#34; he said staring at her in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re few things you should know about..&#34; he began taking his seat as Layla stood in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had changed so much, this was not the man she met at the bar. He was not the man she felt attracted to and spent a night with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not the man that told her she was not useless for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone called her useless back then, but he told her she was not!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened to Nolan now? What made him change that he hated her so much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was her crime, she at least deserved compassion from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even sacrificed to spend a night with him even when he was nothing but good to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was all of that a mistake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should not expect anything from me, Layla, the fact that we&#39;re now mates and that we&#39;ve mated does not mean we&#39;re equals now..&#34; he voiced out and Layla shook her head slowly as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know..&#34; how could she be equal to him? He was an Alpha, she was just Layla. A nobody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can resume your duties as the pack&#39;s Luna but not my Luna..&#34; he instructed in a stern and hard voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have no special relationships with each other..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to be a pack Luna, just let me go!!&#34; She uttered feeling a lump form on her throat, as she fought hard to fight back her tears that were threatening to fall out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you daft!!&#34; He yelled, banging his fists on the table as Layla flinched in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to do it Layla..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to go home..&#34; a tear finally fell from her eyes. She did not want to be here. She wanted to be with Aurora. She needed fresh Air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About that..&#34; he began creasing his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m returning back tomorrow and you&#39;re coming with me, I want to balance a few things before returning back to the pack..&#34; he informed. Now that he had a Luna, the elders of the pack had requested to come back and resume his duties fully. Not part time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay sir&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop calling me sir..&#34; he snapped at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What will people say when they hear you, a Luna calling her husband sir..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, Mr Alden, husband!!!&#34; She shrieked In surprise. When did they become husband and wife? She thought it was just Alpha and Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes husband, by the way you will be living with me back in New York&#34; he said and Layla felt her mouth go dry. How would she live with a devil like him? She would not make it out alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have a choice Layla..&#34; he chimed in sarcastically and Layla smiled bitterly as she contemplated if he heard when Keisha said she was sick. But yet he was making her stand, setting out baseless rules for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going to be living like perfect strangers, nothing else..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay Mr Adlen..&#34; she said obediently, her head facing the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That will be all for now, I&#39;ll ask the maids to send you a change of clothes and you can also request for your lunch if you want&#34; he informed dismissing her off and Layla quietly walked out of his study room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where does she go from here? This was a very huge mansion, she would practically get lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to go back into Nolan&#39;s office again when she saw Keisha waving at her telling her to come over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla breathed in relief as she went to Keisha at least she won&#39;t have to face the devil.</p>
