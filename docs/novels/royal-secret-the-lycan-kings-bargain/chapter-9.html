                <p>Everyone&#39;s eyes were directed at Layla, who stood frightened. They wondered curiously about what she might have done to the president in the past, or if they had ever crossed paths before, to make him this furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xander, who is she, and what is she doing here?&#34; He asked again in a thunderous voice, his icy blue eyes cold as death itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, this is your new secretary. Do you know her?&#34; Xander questioned, facing Nolan, who took a step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me,&#34; he said to Layla, dragging her away towards his office, not giving her any chance to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; He asked immediately he banged the door behind him, pinning her to the wall with his hands around her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;II ..I.&#34; Layla coughed as she struggled with her breath. Never did she expect to meet him here or this way. But why the hell was he overreacting? Did she ever do anything to anger him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me!!!&#34; He growled, and Layla felt her heart seize. If there was another word for scary, then it should be used on him because he scared the living hell out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I..&#34; Layla coughed; how did he expect her to speak when he was strangling her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who sent you?&#34; His breath fanned her face, and Layla immediately felt like crying. What does he mean by all that? No one sent her. She came here to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please let me go,&#34; she managed to say, or he might kill her before even realizing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak,&#34; he ordered, removing his hands from her neck, pushing her aside as if she was some sort of trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand you,&#34; Layla stammered with watery eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who sent you? Or did you think you could come in here because we had sex once? I will not ask again. Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. No one sent me, and I&#39;m not here because we had sex,&#34; Layla replied with labored breathing. He actually thought she was an imposter planted to spy on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear, I have no idea about you. I don&#39;t know your name, your status, or anything. I just came here to work, nothing else,&#34; she said, trying to sound convincing. Who would have thought that he would react like that? It only means that he would kill her if she told him about the pregnancy, saying she&#39;s an imposter trying to pin a baby on him. She was pretty sure he would do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, sir, what happened was a one-night stand, and I&#39;ve long forgotten about that or if it even happened. So please believe me when I say I have no ulterior motives here; I only came to work,&#34; she voiced out, rubbing her neck slowly; it was hurting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have my eyes on you. If you ever try anything stupid, I&#39;ll kill you,&#34; he swore in a single breath as he walked to his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla found herself stumbling backward; it was not just any threat. From the way he looked at her, he would really kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t try&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; he ordered, and Layla quickly dashed out of the office without giving it a second thought. Layla closed the door behind her, and she rested on it, breathing slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What has she gotten herself into? That man is scary as hell. How will she tell him he got her pregnant from that night? He might not even believe her. From the way he looked at her, she could tell he hated her to the core; his eyes spelt nothing but hatred as if she was some sort of mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Layla, you&#39;re in trouble now,&#34; she gasped, arranging her hair and clothes before leaving for her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla got into her office to see the other man waiting for her; Bertha was long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Layla,&#34; he called upon seeing her, and Layla stood a few meters away from him, still shaken from what happened earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations on getting picked as a secretary,&#34; he said, and a smile ghosted his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, sir,&#34; Layla mumbled as she sniffled with her head facing downwards. She has sworn within herself that she would live as a ghost in the office. She would never look at anyone in the eye; it would be as if she doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she knows why Bertha warned her against the president; he was so hostile, and from the way he reacted, she felt she wouldn&#39;t last a week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here, this file contains everything you need to know about your work. You can also ask Bertha to put you through, and I can help when I&#39;m less busy,&#34; he offered as Layla found herself sighing in relief that this one was not as hostile as the president, who looked like his friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Xander,&#34; he flashed a warm smile at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to meet you,&#34; Layla said nervously as they shook hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regan specifically told me to take good care of you,&#34; he informed as Layla nodded. He was the friend Regan talked about, the one who helped Regan get her a job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; she appreciated. She wanted to meet the one that helped her and personally thank him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what?&#34; He chuckled, and Layla could not help but admire how good looking he was. In fact, the president was good looking as well; he just had this dangerous aura, while Xander looked cool to be around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For helping me get the job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing besides the seat was vacant, and we happened to be looking for someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still thanks,&#34; Layla stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right, have a nice day and enjoy your first day at work,&#34; he wished going towards the president&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla exhaled sharply, throwing herself on the chair like a starfish. Coping here would look like a hassle, but she will do just fine if she makes sure to avoid the so-called president. But how can that be possible when they work on the same floor?</p>
