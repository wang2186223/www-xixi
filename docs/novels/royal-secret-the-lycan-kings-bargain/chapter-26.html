                <p>&#34;Layla!!&#34; He shrieked in horror. She was there inside the bathtub drowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you gone mad?&#34; He yelled rushing over to the bathtub and he lifted her up, removing her from the water. Did she really want to attempt suicide?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla gasped in shock the moment she was pulled out of the water, she opened her eyes slowly only to see Nolan holding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is he doing here, and why is he staring at me like that?She questioned herself curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir..&#34; she called out in uncertainty as he was holding her so tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you mad!!?&#34; He yelled releasing her from his hold as he pushed her away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Layla&#39;s brows furrowed, not sure if what she must have done again to anger him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to commit suicide, do it elsewhere not when you&#39;re under my care&#34; he warned as Layla froze in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who and who is commiting suicide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39; wait did he think I was trying to kill myself because he found me under water? &#39; realization struck her and she was tempted to burst into a roaring laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would she attempt suicide? Because of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not the first person to shower her with insults, she grew up with insults and endless tauntings from Rosalie. so why would she try to kill herself now when she had never attempted it in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not when she now had a reason to live and survive. Her baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t possibly think of killing herself and her unborn child, not because Nolan scolded her, in fact he was not worth that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she was doing was only a method she used in controlling herself in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Rosalie taunted her then, she would go under water for a few minutes. She used that as a means to calm herself down and forget about everything else. Usually it was as if she was in her own world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir I was..&#34; she began trying to explain herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!!&#34; He snapped coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not another word from you!&#34; He warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to kill yourself do it elsewhere, did you think of attempting suicide because of the case you broke?&#34; He asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts were that maybe she was troubled because of that and felt that it would be best to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir I did..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!! You don&#39;t dare speak when I&#39;m still talking&#34; he growled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mess has already been taken care of, so till we&#39;re gone from here, don&#39;t think of trying something stupid&#34; he spelled out as Layla decided to keep shut, he would never give her the chance to explain herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla suddenly felt an unsettling feeling at the depths of her stomach. It felt as if she was losing her breath and she immediately wished it wasn&#39;t what she thought it would be. She did but come with her inhaler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan noticed the funny movements Layla was making and he became alerted again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you drink poison??&#34; He asked alarmingly and Layla began to gasp for breath. She was having an attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is happening to you?&#34; He quickly rushed to hold her to prevent her from falling ignoring the wetness of her clothes and body and Layla kept gasping for breath as she placed her hands on her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was a Lycan and was not a fan of sickness because he hardly got sick, only werewolves were a little vulnerable to a few diseases. So he knew nothing about what was going on with her because he had never seen something like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Did you consume anything?&#34; Layla badly wanted to punch him from being oblivious of what was happening but she couldn&#39;t because she was losing strength and her asthma tended to be very serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m having an attack&#34; she managed to say breathing heavily as her chest heaved up and down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What attack!!&#34; Nolan seriously has to idea about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A..sthma&#34; Layla gasped. How is this man a billionaire? He can&#39;t even recognize an asthma patient. Layla wondered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck!&#34; Nolan cursed. From the best of his knowledge asthma could be very fatal. She needed an inhaler and if she didn&#39;t get one she could die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s your inhaler?&#34; He quickly asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do.n&#39;t&#34; Layla couldn&#39;t finish her statement as she was already getting out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan quickly scooped her up in his arms and he took her to the room dropping her on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily for him the waiter was there cleaning the mess in the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter immediately stopped what he was doing when he saw the both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get me an inhaler!!&#34; He requested and the waiter dashed out to get one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat beside Layla holding her hand as she tried gasping for breath. Her eyes were almost closing as the black of her eyes were no longer visible. It was as if life was living her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was never an expert in things like this so he didn&#39;t know of any method to reduce this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hang in there Layla&#34; he whispered to her ears as she clasped his hand she was holding tighter. She was trying so hard to fight it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted her up a little from the bed, helping her to sit up and he sat behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on,&#34; he said softly. In as much as he didn&#39;t like her, he didn&#39;t want her to die, she was still his destined mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter came running in with an inhaler in his hands which he gave to Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla..&#34; he fixed the inhaler in her mouth, blowing some air into her mouth through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He removed the inhaler from her mouth on seeing that her breathing was stabilizing. She was out of danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter returned to his work and Layla remained in Nolan arms as she was still breathing softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan jaw worked in confusion, when he read her resume, he never saw the part where she wrote that she had asthma in her medical reports.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later after her breathing had stabilized he got up from the bed after helping her to rest against the headboard as she questioned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this your first time having an attack?&#34; She shook her head indicating a no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been an asthmatic patient right from when she was little. She had been dealing with it for quite a long time now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you so careless?&#34; He suddenly asked in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have asthma and you did not bother to bring an inhaler with you and why is this not written in your medical reports?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;ve not had an attack in four years&#34; she replied softly. That was why she did not bring her inhaler but why did she suddenly have an attack?</p>
