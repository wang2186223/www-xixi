                <p>Layla&#39;s eyes fluttered open as she felt someone holding her in a tight embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed that she was lying on a bed and last night&#39;s events came flooding into her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her and Nolan had sex, not just any sex, a hard core sex, that she could feel her thighs aching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had brought her to the bed last night, where they ended up having another intense session of hard core sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla blushed hard as she remembered last night, the words he whispered into her ears, his fingers inside of her and finally his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to turn but Nolan was holding her so tight to himself that she couldn&#39;t move. The fact that they were both still naked on the bed not helping issues at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to leave at least to calm herself down and prepare herself for tomorrow when he finally woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squirming like an earthworm, she managed to release herself off Nolan&#39;s hold. Layla sat up from the bed, resting against the headboard as she exhaled sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night was definitely a long one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked outside the window as she wondered what the time was, then she discovered that it was almost morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes traveled to Nolan&#39;s direction and she noticed that he was sleeping so peacefully, he looked so cute and peaceful when he was asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla quietly got off the bed as she headed for the bathroom, she needed to shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body was sticky from sweat and pre cum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned the faucet on immediately when she got into the bathroom, allowing the cold and refreshing water from the shower to her bare skin. It was so relaxing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she noticed something unusual on her neck from her reflection in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out of the shower, she walked closer to the mirror to see what was at the side of her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like a tattoo, but Layla knew it wasn&#39;t because she had never gotten one before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her hand there, rubbing it gently. She wondered what it was. It was a drawing of something she couldn&#39;t recognize. She decided to wait for Nolan to wake up. Maybe he would have an explanation for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing deeply, Layla stepped back into the shower and shut her eyes closed, enjoying the comfort it offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were still shut, even she heard someone walk in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately snapped her eyes open as she turned to see Nolan standing at the door. Completely naked, his disheveled hair, his tattoos, his biceps and then his huge.they were all so tempting and inviting, at the same time intimidating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla realized that she was naked also, she immediately became embarrassed and wrapped her around her chest in embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m leaving..&#34; she mumbled with her head facing the ground shyly. Her assumption was that maybe he had come in here to shower, not knowing that she was Inside. But Nolan was fully aware that Layla was awake. He heard the sound of water dropping and when he didn&#39;t see Layla on the bed. He guessed that she was in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need..&#34; Nolan voiced out in a low tone and Layla was forced to look up in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But si..&#34; Layla&#39;s voice trailed off when she realized that his eyes were fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the water droplets falling from her hair, to her flawless skin, Nolan couldn&#39;t look away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pink lips, then her breasts. The only thing that was ringing in his head was for him to hold her tight and damn her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he succumbed to his thoughts as he suddenly pinned her against the wall, slamming his lips on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their kiss lasted for a few seconds, the water from the shower flowing freely on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan removed his lips from hers as he trailed kisses down to her breasts, taking one of them in his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla felt the urge to push him away, saying all these were wrong. But the pleasure she was getting now was too much , and she wanted more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sucked her nipple roughly, grazing his teeth through it from time to time which earned him soft gasp from Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He removed his mouth from her breasts, possessing her lips once again as he kissed her hungrily and naughtily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sinful tongue explored her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking off from the kiss, he locked his eyes with Layla for a while before he suddenly squatted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened at the sight of him squatting on the floor, looking at her with those breathtaking icy blue eyes of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then reached for her hips with both hands outstretched, causing her to catch her breath from his actions. His handsome face was right before her p**sy, which made her heart seize in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her entire body burned red as she unconsciously stepped back. But he held her still, not letting her move even a single inch away from him. &#34;Be good and stay still, Layla&#34; His eyes smoldered through his thick and dark lashes as he stared up at her and when he lowered his eyes, she watched them lingering on her down there. That sent a jolt of desire running through her again. And she saw something depraved and starved crossing those icy blue as he raked his hungry eyes over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His teasing hands then traveled from her hips to her curved behind. She winced a little when his fingers brushed across the cheek of her butt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caressed her butt cheek gently which sent an electric jolt right through her body each time he did that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shivered at the suggestive look in his eyes and at the same time because of his fingers accidentally or purposefully brushing against her lower folds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flushing, she was about to forcefully tear her gaze off him when he released her from his gaze first. He focused his attention on his slow ministrations, his hands sliding downwards until it reached the tips of her toes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her leg, he placed her feet on his leg. Something in her was turning into a volcano that would erupt anytime soon the longer she stared at him. The longer she stared, the more her eyes formed a blurry haze that sent her mind covered in a fog. Staring for an extended time at this insanely handsome man squatting right down there and touching her, she truly had no defense against this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without her knowing, she started biting on her lips as her gaze stayed completely glued on him. Lord, she wanted him this gorgeous boss of hers. She desperately wanted him to slam her against the wall and damn her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze settled on his well-formed hands on her feet and then to his powerful tattooed muscles. He was so toned, so hot so perfect that it was truly impossible for any woman to not lust for him. She wanted to know how it would feel to touch him that tattooed fiery skin of his she wondered how it would feel to hold him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla quickly brushed that thought of her head, she shouldn&#39;t be thinking about that now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should be thinking of how she would face him later, because she was so utterly embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in her thoughts, she was jolted back to reality by her own loud moan when his fingers brushed against her down there again. She blazed red in embarrassment as their eyes accidentally met. She had moaned so loudly before she even realized it. Oh lord!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked in satisfaction but in the very next moment, the hunger in his eyes took over everything else as he stared up at her.</p>
