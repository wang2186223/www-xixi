                <p>&#34;No, no, no...It&#39;s not what you think?&#34; Layla began in stammers, she didn&#39;t know what was in the text but whatever it was she was sure Nolan was not supposed to see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only went to the grocery store, I swear to God..&#34; she swore fidgeting in fear. The murderous glint in Nolan&#39;s eyes scared the living hell out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what&#39;s the meaning of this bullshit?&#34; He howerled grabbing Layla&#39;s arm as she flinched in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was nice spending time with you today, hope to go on a date soon ( love emoji). Hope you got home safe&#34; he read out in fury. Was Layla seriously seeing another man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,no Nolan, you&#39;re misunderstanding the whole issue here&#34; she defended. The text was from Regan. Now she knew. How would she explain to Nolan that it was just a harmless text, Nolan would not spare her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Misunderstanding?&#34; He chuckled in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you meet him? So you went to see a man before going to the grocery store?&#34; He asked in disbelief as Layla quickly shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan please believe me. We met just by accident and Regan is just a friend nothing else..&#34; she tried to reason with him but it seemed as if none of that was getting into Nolan&#39;s head. He looked so angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you now going dates with friends right?&#34; He asked as Layla trembled. How would she make Nolan understand, he was really hard to reckon with whenever he was angry and now he was mad with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not a date, it&#39;s only..&#34; she had not finished her statement when Nolan suddenly pushed her off his laps and she landed straight on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ow..&#34; Layla winced fighting back her tears as she got up slowly from the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s only what?&#34; He asked standing up also as he stood in front of her but Layla ignored his question as she wrapped her hands around her chest with her head facing the ground while she whimpered softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me!!!&#34; His voice thundered in the whole room and Layla flinched backwards in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing Nolan, believed me..&#34; she cried as she was not able to hold back her tears anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you seeing another man?&#34; He suddenly asked in a low voice as he felt his blood boil. The thought of Layla with another man infuriating him, that was what he would never allow to happen. Layla was his and he could do to her whatever he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonono..&#34; Layla cried raising her hands in the air. &#34;I swear to God Nolan, I&#39;m not seeing another man. Regan is just a friend&#34; she swore but he didn&#39;t seem as if he was ready to believe her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was allowing his anger to cloud his judgement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A friend you go out on a date with?&#34; He grilled stepping closer to her and Layla stepped back in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regan is my friend from high school, he&#39;s the twin brother of Aurora, the three of us are best friends. I swear..&#34; she spluttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only met him at the grocery store where I went to get food for Maddox and it&#39;s just a friendly date&#34; she explained. She just couldn&#39;t get why he was overreacting, he had said it himself that he didn&#39;t want anything to do with her, then how was it his problem if she went out with someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look Layla, let me sound this warning to you!&#34; He began pointing his finger maliciously at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not allowed to see or talk to anybody, you hear me!!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only I have a say in whatever you did, so you get that?&#34; He growled at Layla who stepped away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you don&#39;t own me..&#34; Layla retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say?&#34; He squinted his eyes as he stepped closer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said you don&#39;t own me neither do I owe you to be this indebted to you..&#34; she uttered as she inhaled sharply. He had no right or say in the things she was involved in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Nolan muttered in confusion as his brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said you don&#39;t own me Nolan Adlen!&#34; Layla yelled, she had suffered a lot enough from him already. It was time she stood up from herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The fact we are mates doesn&#39;t mean that you can do whatever you want with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t treat me right, you treat me like trash then you tell me to stay away from people who actually make me feel like I have a reason for existing, no Nolan you can&#39;t do that..&#34; she stated wiping her tears off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You clearly said our relationship is only out of convenience and circumstances and you don&#39;t care about whatever happens to me, so let me be..&#34; she spelled out. He did whatever he wanted while he laid out rules for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m your Alpha Layla..&#34; he said in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then act like one!&#34; Layla yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then act like an Alpha and not a beast..&#34; she voiced out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was never my fault that I was chosen to be your mate. So please Nolan don&#39;t take out your aggression on me and it was never my fault your first mate died. I didn&#39;t even know about werewolves at that time, so if you&#39;re looking for who to vent out your anger on, you can do that with the moon goddess and not me!&#34; She said with a note of finality in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosalie and scarlet always treated her like a piece of shit in the past and she was never able to stand up for herself, now Nolan wanted to do the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that&#39;s what she would never allow to happen. Aurora was right after all, she was going to be a mother soon, so she needed to start standing up for herself, that was the only way she would be able to protect her child on the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do whatever you want, so I&#39;ll do whatever I want!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were away for two days and I said nothing about it..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do whatever I want, I&#39;m the Alpha..&#34; he growled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;m your Luna!&#34; She yelled back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I can go out with whoever I want to and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla!!&#34; His voice thundered and Layla suddenly kept quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Has she been speaking too much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still hadn&#39;t forgotten that Nolan could be feral and if he ended up taking it out on her, she would be no match for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what?&#34; He began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go f*ck yourself..&#34; he said walking out on a speechless Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gosh, did I just say that?&#34; Layla gasped as she watched Nolan leave as she marveled if she just stood up to Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
