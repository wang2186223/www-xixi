                <p>From one look, one could tell that they were obviously not in the mood to speak or talk to anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was still very angry at Nolan for what he had said to her and Nolan was still angry at himself, thinking that he was irresponsible and didn&#39;t take care of things properly.</p>

                <p>The guards on duty bowed in respect as they both arrived, the huge door sprang open and Layla saw Keisha standing there her face beaming with smiles, behind her was Carla, who had an irritated look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys are here, hi Layla..&#34; Keisha waved jovially at Layla who flashed a smile at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Hayes?&#34; Nolan asked, a dark Aura surrounding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who would see him should know better than anyone that he needed to be avoided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At the dungeon, welcome Nolan..&#34; Carla chimed in as she walked to Nolan holding his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll walk you there..&#34; she offered. Still trying hard to get why Nolan brought Layla, a human to the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need, I can walk myself&#34; he refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take care of Layla..&#34; he instructed, removing Carla&#39;s hand from his arm as he gently pushed it away before walking away from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you!!&#34; Carla snapped at Layla immediately Nolan was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; She questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Nolan thinking that he brought a human to the pack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of question is that?&#34; Keisha stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is none of your business Keisha, I&#39;m speaking to her not you, so please step aside..&#34; Carla retorted venomously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so annoyed that Nolan told her to take care of Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The f*ck!! Layla was not a f*cking baby!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; She asked again. But got no reply from Layla, who was not in the mood to speak to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m talking to you!!&#34; Carla snarled walking over to grab Layla&#39;s arm but was stopped by Keisha in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her!!&#34; Carla pointed at Layla angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s my problem, she&#39;s just a common secretary, but yet doesn&#39;t know how to speak and is always rude, I&#39;ll make sure to teach her a lesson, so she will know how to talk when next I&#39;m talking to her&#34; Carla blabbed angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not a common secretary Carla..&#34; Keisha drew out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, she is..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not, in fact she is Nolan&#39;s mate, that&#39;s why he brought her to the pack house&#34; Keisha said as Carla froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W...hat do yo..u m..ean?&#34; She stammered in bewilderment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said Layla and Nolan are mates..&#34; Keisha repeated, holding Layla&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the look of things, Nolan might have changed his mind last night and didn&#39;t reject her anymore. That&#39;s why he brought her along to the pack house, because he had rejected Layla, there was no need to bring her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me..&#34; Carla laughed, waving that off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keisha was just trying to pull her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did Nolan find a mate, and he didn&#39;t even mention it, that he ever found one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe it Carla..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know You&#39;re lying, because Nolan never told me..&#34; Carla spat, finding it hard to believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s probably because he didn&#39;t feel the need to do so, or he felt like you had no right to know..&#34; Keisha shrugged her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone knows, Xander, Darren and I&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I don&#39;t know about it!!.&#34; Carla exclaimed her eyes wide as saucers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to..&#34; Keisha smiled warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla felt like laughing, the look on Carla&#39;s face was just so funny. And she was happy that she had finally been out in her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla had never insulted Carla, or ever been rude to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But from the first time they met, Carla was always rude to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna!!&#34; Someone exclaimed happily from behind them as they both turned to see Xander who just walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna!!&#34; Both Carla and Keisha exclaimed in horror at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes..&#34; Xander confirmed stopping in front of them .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Layno Luna..&#34; he said playfully as he made a curtsey before her like he was in front of a noble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi..&#34; Layla waved in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What Luna??&#34; Carla shrieked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This Luna..&#34; Xander pointed at Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna!!&#34; Keisha squealed, her face beaming with smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm hmmm&#34; Xander nodded his head slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know about this, Nolan never mentioned it?&#34; Carla nudged, her face getting red from the intense anger she was feeling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Nolan&#39;s gamma..&#34; Xander reminded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, you&#39;re his gamma..&#34; Carla repeated with sarcasm and Xander swayed his head to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never liked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My major priority is to protect the Alpha, same with his Luna..&#34; he began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right from when I stepped in, I knew Layla was my Luna, because I feel the need to respect and protect her,&#34; he explained. Nolan had not told him about it but he could tell. Nolan did not reject her in fact he made her his Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really!!!&#34; Keisha squealed as she hugged Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me about it?&#34; She asked, holding Layla&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why do you look like this?&#34; Her brows furrowed as she looked at Layla. She looked dull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you feeling fine?&#34; She asked placing her hand on Layla&#39;s neck to feel her temperature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tucked her hair behind when she saw a mark on her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s th&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine..&#34; Layla cut her short, bringing her hair back to its place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she understood the importance of long hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her short hair would barely be able to hide Nolan&#39;s mark on her neck not to talk of the hickeys. The one Keisha reportedly saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s mark was on the right side of her neck, Keisha checked the left side. She only saw a hickey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hick..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine..&#34; Layla chimed in, stopping Keisha from what she was about to say. But Xander and Carla got the message. Carla felt like rushing to Layla and strangling her. So they even had sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just tired that&#39;s all..&#34; a smile ghosted Layla&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand it&#39;s normal..&#34; Keisha said mischievously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean that..&#34; Layla intoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mean what?&#34; Keisha raised a brow at her as Layla bit her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it, I&#39;m just having a hard time adjusting..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t say anything but anyways you have me Layla, I&#39;ll help you with everything you need to know about the park..&#34; Keisha volunteered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys are so impossible..&#34; Carla grunted in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan has not even said anything about this, just shut up, she&#39;s not our Luna and can never be!!&#34; She yelled walking away in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mind Carla, she gets easily irritated and is super annoying..&#34; Keisha stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Nolan?&#34; Xander inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He went to the dungeon..&#34; replied Keisha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll go there, Layla, do you mind coming along?&#34; Xander offered as Layla shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s Coming with us..&#34; Keisha interrupted, dragging Layla away and they headed to the dungeon.</p>
