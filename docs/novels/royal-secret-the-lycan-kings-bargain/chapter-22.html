                <p>&#34;Thanks for the meal Regan&#34; Layla appreciated as Regan&#39;s car stopped in front of her house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome and thanks to you I had a great time&#34; he smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same here&#34; she mumbled as he had helped her lift her mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was a very unlucky day for her at work, the issue with Nolan and then the threats from Carla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she could take some days off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you not coming in?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, say hi to Aurora for me,&#34; he refused. He had somewhere important to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then&#34; Layla shrugged get shoulders making way to open the door, when Regan spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything going well at work?&#34; He asked out of the blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhh?&#34; Layla raised a brow at him and she had this puzzled look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he asking her that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything going well at work?&#34; He asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ye...s, yes &#34; Layla stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything is going well, why&#39;d you ask?&#34; She grilled, thinking maybe he must know something or he probably sensed the coldness from Regan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing just asking,&#34; Regan replied with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was that he found Layla working under Nolan uncomfortable, for some reasons she saw him as a threat. A big one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, good night&#34; Layla waved, stepping out from the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bye Layla&#34; he waved driving off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla went straight to the door as Aurora and her had something very important to talk about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really wanted to know about her and Xander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back!&#34; Aurora uttered, fixing her eyes on the television screen with a bowl of popcorn in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, hmm&#34; Layla shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t Regan come inside?&#34; She questioned not removing her eyes from the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess he had somewhere to be but he said to say Hi&#34; Layla informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He picked you up from work?&#34; Aurora queried, squinting her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we went out for a meal&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woahhh!!!&#34; Aurora exclaimed in amazement as she dropped the bowl of popcorn on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something is going on isn&#39;t it?&#34; She asked playfully as she smiled in mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, what!! No&#34; Layla waved her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regan is like a brother to her, Regan and Aurora are like the siblings she never had. She loves and cares for him as a brother, not the other way round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?Then can you explain this, the meal?&#34; Aurora grilled, smiling mischievously as she was just trying to pull Layla&#39;s leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aurora&#34; Layla began I&#39;m a low and serious tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and Regan are like my siblings, you know that can never happen between us and Regan knows that too&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just pulling your legs okay&#34; Aurora giggled collecting her bowl of popcorn from the table and she focused her attention back on the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla could say she didn&#39;t like her brother, but that couldn&#39;t be said for him. She knew he liked Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Aurora didn&#39;t want to interfere in anything, Layla could not see that and she didn&#39;t want to be the one to tell her. If Regan and Layla are meant to be together, they will be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they&#39;re not meant to be together, fine by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speaking of..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speaking of what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought we can never hide secrets from each other?&#34; Layla asked with a grim expression on her face as Aurora frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Secrets?&#34; She scrunched her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t hide secrets, you know I tell you everything&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why didn&#39;t you tell me about your hot ex, I&#39;m so angry at you?&#34; She gestured her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a lot of ex&#39;s Layla and you know about all of them&#34; Aurora voiced out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I don&#39;t know about Xander&#34; Layla said and Aurora instantly stilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla and Aurora always shared their secrets with each other. They literally knew everything about themselves. Layla knew about all the boyfriends she&#39;s had but never once did Aurora tell her about Xander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You met him?&#34; Aurora fumed in anger, the sound of that name always pissed her off, she was still waiting for the day she would get a hold of him, she had sworn to beat him to a pulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he&#39;s a friend of Regan&#39;s. The one who helped with my job&#34; Layla recalled, hoping that would ring a bell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Fuck&#34; Aurora cursed as she pursed her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I totally forgot about that,&#34; she groaned in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xander is the reason she knows about Raleigh company. She was trying to get a hold of him when she discovered he worked there, but she never got the chance to go in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I totally forgot that the asshole works there&#34; she gritted her teeth as she fumed in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Asshole?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Xander is a total asshole and I&#39;ll make sure to kill him when I get a hold of him&#34; she swore. She would definitely have her revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he&#39;s your ex?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he is. But I never counted that as a relationship, we dated for just a week&#34; Aurora informed as Layla gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A week!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes a week and you know what, that asshole is nothing but a total Playboy&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a player too, you&#39;re never serious with your relationships&#34; Layla reminded her friend Incase she was forgetting that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to Aurora, men were scum and she could treat them however she likes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she never had serious relationship with any, all her relationships were just for fun</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but Xander is worse, I thought I had finally found the right one unbeknownst  I was being played. I lost something of mine that was very valuable to him&#34; Each time Aurora remembered that day, she wanted to kill him over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both met at a club that was like two years ago when she was nineteen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first she thought he was a big catch because he was handsome and good looking and everyone wanted a handsome boyfriend like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan was to get close to him, so she could flaunt him around at school. One thing led to the other and she found herself having feelings for him and he claimed he liked her also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But She only ended up getting played by him and then he tossed her aside like nothing happened, in fact the next week she caught him kissing a girl from  her class in the same club they usually went to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened between you guys?&#34; Layla asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; Aurora sighed, standing up from the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to bed&#34; Aurora yawned, going straight to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only thing I can you is that, Xander is a total asshole and is never sincere about his feelings, he tosses women around as he wishes, so if he ever comes to you professing his love, Run!&#34; Aurora concluded as if passing a warning and she went  into her room slamming the door after her.</p>
