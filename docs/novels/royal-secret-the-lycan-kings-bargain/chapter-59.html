                <p>&#34;Thanks for today Regan..&#34; Layla appreciated as they walked towards Regan&#39;s car. &#34;You&#39;ve really made my day&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anytime shortie..&#34; he grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to get going now&#34; she announced as it was already 6pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah it&#39;s getting late. Come on I&#39;ll drop you off..&#34; he offered, but Layla quickly waved him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she would allow Regan drop her off especially in front of Nolan&#39;s apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was equivalent to a mad man and would give her an earful if he saw them together. He had literally done that before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No thanks, I&#39;ll take it from here..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I insist. Besides I should know where yiy live now&#34; he reasoned but Layla shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay Regan. I&#39;m fine..&#34; she said in an assuring tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to go now. Take care..&#34; she waved walking away quickly with her stuffed animal in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh shit!&#34; Layla cursed gritting her teeth. She was always unfortunate even time it came to her getting a taxi. She&#39;s been standing here for thirty minutes now but yet no was in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took another look at the time as she groaned loudly. Nolan will definitely skin her alive today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The passt few days had been very quiet for her as they both minded their businesses. But now she was breaking his rule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God please, let a taxi pass by&#34; she prayed repeatedly silently. Thankfully for her about five minutes later, a taxi came passing by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Taxi??&#34; Layla jumped as she swinged her hands in the air gesticulating for the taxi to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crescent street..&#34; she informed hurriedly getting into the taxi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla kept taking in deep breaths as she placed her hand on the door knob contemplating of she should go in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just go in Layla, it&#39;s just five minutes past seven..&#34; she tried consoling herself though she was very scared. She was only five minutes late, he wouldn&#39;t make a fuss out of that right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathering every ounce of courage she could get, she turned the door knob and slowly walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lights were on and she could see a shadow from the sitting room. In Fact two shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding to ignore, she began to head straight from her room, tip toeing when a deep dry voice suddenly rang in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jesus Christ!!&#34; Layla jolted back in fear as she slowly turned to see Nolan sitting on the couch in the sitting room with a glass of wine between his fingers. Maddox sleeping beside the chair he was seated on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dressed in all black as usual, making him look like a grim reaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here..&#34; he beckoned for her to come closer as she shakily dragged her feet to where he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re late..&#34; he spelled out slowing dropping the cup on a table near him as it made a light sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t find a taxi on time..&#34; she responded softly biting her lips hard as his eyes raked her from head to toe, then it finally settled on the stuffed animal she was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where were you?&#34; He asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went to see a friend..&#34; she replied, wondering why he was carrying out a question and answer session with her. She could not understand him at her. She was adult and had the right to leave whenever she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What friend?&#34; He grilled in a low but dangerous voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s your problem&#34; Layla voiced out picking her words carefully. She didn&#39;t want to sound rude but she just had to ask. It was not not his problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; Surprise flickered in his narrowed eyes as he tried to comprehend what she just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could grasp the situation, she emphasized more on her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not your business Nolan, whoever I decide to meet or not..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just broke a rule..&#34; he smirked as he stood up majestically before walking to slowly to where Layla stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry..&#34; Layla apologized, intimidated by his dominating presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were being bold just a while ago?&#34; His lips curved up and Layla swallowed deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just let me go, I&#39;m only five minutes late..&#34; she pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You broke a rule Layla, 7pm is 7pm..&#34; he deadpanned as their eyes met and he said again. &#34;And you&#39;re not allowed to keep friends, Layla&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand you..&#34; Layla mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t owe me Nolan Adlen..&#34; she painstakingly says through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not your toy whom you can just lay out rules for..&#34; she said trying to keep her cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just keep acting as if you have the upper hand here. You don&#39;t! And I can leave whenever I want. So stop ordering me around..&#34; she uttered breathlessly taking a step backward from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea what had made her to say that but there was one thing she was certain of, she actually felt a little better after telling him how she felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; He raised a brow at her. He strangely looked calm which worries Layla a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You keep acting as if I&#39;m indebted to you. You treat me like trash. I literally don&#39;t have a say of my own. Now you&#39;re picking my friends..&#34; she scoffed in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I owe you Layla..&#34; he emphasized in a deep and boisterous tone as he took a step closer to her, Layla taking backward at the same time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I owe every part of you. Everything..&#34; he deadpanned on the word everything and Layla&#39;s back finally hit the cold wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I owe all of you Layla..&#34; he leaned closer to her ear whispering in a rugged voice that Layla&#39;s stuffed animal and purse unconsciously fell from her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then treat me right..&#34; she retorted speaking in a low voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can treat you however I like, Layla..&#34; he picked a strand of her hair coiling it around his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whenever I want to and whatever I want to do, Layla..&#34; he stated, the sound of Layla from his lips sending electrifying chills down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And for breaking my rules, you&#39;ll get punished..&#34; he concluded and before Layla could register what he was saying, he had already lifted her off the ground.</p>
