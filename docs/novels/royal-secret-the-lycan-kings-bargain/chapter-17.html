                <p>&#34;You&#39;re here!&#34; She ran to him feeling so excited on seeing him. He looked so gorgeous like the morning sun, and the black clothes he was putting on made him look even more stunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was so worried about you.&#34; She pouted, hugging him tight. &#39;Hmm, he smells so nice,&#39; Carla thought to herself, inhaling his pleasant scent.</p>

                <p>&#34;He&#39;s currently not in the pack, but I told him you were coming,&#34; she responded, walking behind Nolan who went straight to the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell him to come over immediately; I&#39;ll be here for only a short period of time,&#34; he ordered, sitting on one of the chairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do that.&#34; Carla replied, signaling for a guard to come over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get the Beta; tell him the Alpha seeks his presence.&#34; The guard bowed slightly before disappearing from the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why just a short time?&#34; Carla frowned, sitting very close to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hardly come to the pack; you should at least spend a month or so here. I&#39;ve missed you a lot.&#34; She pouted, holding his hands affectionately. She dreamed of becoming the Luna of the Enchanted Moon pack someday and also the woman that would be by Nolan&#39;s side, and she was working on accomplishing that goal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m busy.&#34; Short and concise was his reply as he held a grim expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the Alpha of this pack, Nolan; you should spend some time with your people, with me.&#34; She muttered the last few words softly while she caressed his hand that she was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was very lucky to be able to come this close to Nolan. In fact, aside from his Beta Darren and Gamma Xander, who happened to be his best friend, she was the only one who was opportuned to come close to him. Apparently, everyone in the pack knew that Carla was a very special person to the Alpha; that&#39;s why she was able to get close to him, request for anything she wanted. Some even hinted that she would be the Luna of the pack after he lost his mate in the war. They&#39;ve even begun to accord her the respect of a Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m busy, Carla.&#34; Nolan repeatedly pushed her hand away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, then.&#34; She sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll follow you back then, so I can relieve you of stress. I know you must be stressed out from all the work, the one at the pack and at the company too; I can help.&#34; She said, trying to convince him. Though she could easily guess what his answer would be. No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he refused instantly, and Carla clenched her fist. She knew it, but she&#39;ll not stop trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened last night? You&#39;ve still not told me the reason why you never came?&#34; She demanded to know. She waited last night for him to show up, but he never came. She called, but he never picked up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something important came up,&#34; he answered lazily, raising his eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Carla asked, sensing that he looked stressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m fine.&#34; He sucked his teeth, staring at the ceiling. He found it very hard trying to focus with Layla under the same roof with him. He spent the whole night battling with his wolf who wanted to tear out of him, and him in the arms of his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you looked stressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lay...&#34; he stopped speaking when he realized the name he wanted to call out. When did her name suddenly come to his mind? He should refrain from thinking about her and reject her as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lay...la.&#34; Carla drew out, uncertain if it&#39;s Layla he wanted to call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you mean Layla?&#34; She asked, with her brows lifted up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Nolan.&#34; The door sprang open as a man walked in. His blonde hair was tied to the back, and his gray eyes also suited him perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darren, you&#39;re here.&#34; Carla uttered, standing up from the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came as fast as I could when I heard Nolan was around,&#34; Darren said with a stoic face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave you two then; see you later Nolan.&#34; Carla waved, and she left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are you leaving?&#34; Darren questioned, sitting on one of the chairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I&#39;m certain that everything is fine over here,&#34; Nolan answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything is fine; I had the last incident sorted out. I also found out that it was done by some rouges; we&#39;re working on catching them,&#34; Darren explained as Nolan shook his head slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tighten the security around this place and make sure no one goes in and out from the pack, not until this issue has been sorted out,&#34; Nolan ordered. The safety of his people was his first priority as he would do anything to make sure they were safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you must have come here unprepared,&#34; Darren observed. From the way he was dressed casually, one could easily guess that he just drove here. Enchanted Moon pack was located at the depths of the woods in New York. Only a few people knew of its existence aside from the werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I did.&#34; He confessed; he didn&#39;t want to go back to the house after Layla had left. That&#39;s why he came here because he usually came to the pack at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xander told me about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Told you what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That you found her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Found who?&#34; Nolan glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mate, of course. You&#39;re lucky Nolan; the moon goddess has granted you a second chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sadly, I don&#39;t want that.&#34; Nolan retorted; he had planned on rejecting Layla the next time he saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re really planning on rejecting her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I don&#39;t bluff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about your pack Nolan and what the advantage of having a mate is; it will make you stronger and build your pack. Think about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can build my pack myself; I don&#39;t need her.&#34; Nolan uttered.</p>
