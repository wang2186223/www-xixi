                <p>&#34;What do you mean by no?&#34; Layla stuttered in exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been drugged..&#34; he informed and Layla fell back to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight was really a long night, it has been this after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drugged?&#34; She raised a brow at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she wondered what drugs they might have used on him and when they drugged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes..&#34; Nolan confirmed gritting his teeth in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could feel the aphrodisiac running his veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he knew exactly when he had consumed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was definitely when he drank the wine that Hayes offered him, a wine that contained aphrodisiac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned unto him that Hayes had other tricks up his sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not bad right?&#34; Layla stammered, if it was just drugs, he could just sleep and when he wakes up the drugs would wear off, or better still soak himself in cold water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re not just normal drugs Layla..&#34; he drew out sucking his teeth. He needed to find a woman as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what are they?&#34; She asked, seeing his discomfort, she could tell that it was serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a worried look on his face and it was so unlike Nolan to be worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always had a passive look on his face that you wouldn&#39;t know what he was thinking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aphrodisiac..&#34; he replied in a low tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That shouldn&#39;t be an issue right? I&#39;ve read about aphrodisiacs before, you can get out of your system easily&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All you have to do is soak yourself in cold water..&#34; she informed as that was the only thing she could think of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan listened with rapt attention as she spoke then he laughed in ridicule when she was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so naive Layla &#34; he commented, she was oblivious about the deceit of the world and thought everything would go on smoothly. What she wasn&#39;t aware of was that in life, things usually didn&#39;t turn out the way you wanted it to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not naive, I&#39;m just trying to help..&#34; she voiced out. Though he always scolded her, she still cared for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how bad a person would treat her, she would always care for that person. Like the likes of Rosalie and her daughter scarlet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was never the kind to wish her enemy dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your help is not helping&#34; he stated and she bit her lips in frustration. Now she felt like passing out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want him to tell her to tear him open and bring out something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hope I&#39;m not burning or tearing you open?&#34; She raised a brow at him, because she wasn&#39;t sure she would last if she did that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hayes must have added something to the wine he offered..&#34; Nolan informed and all Layla could say was thank God.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nolan hadn&#39;t stopped her earlier, she would have drank from it too and then be in the same shoes with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the life of her child will be endangered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was part of his plan afterall..&#34; Nolan mumbled, the plan was to render him totally weak and useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then when he tried to escape, Hayes aimed for Layla&#39;s life. In case the drug started having its effects. There would be no way out for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The plan to render me useless as you can see, the drug is already getting effective..&#34; he explained. He needed to get out of this place immediately. His only remedy was a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of drug is this? as long as it&#39;s a drug, I&#39;m sure there will be an antidote?&#34; Layla reasoned. There would definitely be an antidote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a drug specially designed for werewolves, it&#39;s a very strong drug and my only remedy is a woman..&#34; he replied, keeping his eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A woman?&#34; Layla frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How will a woman be the remedy to this?&#34; She pointed out, seeing no reason why he needed a woman. A woman didn&#39;t even fit into the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need a woman to f*ck&#34; he said bluntly with a raw voice and Layla mouthed an OH.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was what he meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there no other remedy?&#34; She asked as she didn&#39;t want him to go out at night to look for a woman. Where will he find one by this time of the night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, if I don&#39;t relieve myself of this intensifying sexual desire I might.&#34; His voice trailed off and he fixed his eyes on Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might what?&#34; Layla gulped loudly as a huge bump went down her throat. Wild thoughts running through her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts were that he would lose it, then pin her to the wall like a beast and use her however he liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might what?&#34; She asked again as her heart raced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would be paralyzed&#34; he said as his lips curved up in mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was definitely not the answer she was expecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was what would happen to him, if he didn&#39;t get a woman quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh..&#34; Layla mouthed and realization dawned on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was literally thinking in an opposite direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you going to find a woman?&#34; She questioned curiously, it was late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be hard to find someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will, Xander can take care of that&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get me a shirt from the first room on the right..&#34; he instructed as Layla stilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you can stay alone till tomorrow, I&#39;ll be sure to come back to get you soon, I&#39;ll bring you a meal when coming..&#34; he promised. She had suffered a lot today for his sake. And it was only right if he repaid her kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need, I can make myself something&#34; she waved him off and he shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, you&#39;ll find some foodstuffs in the fridge..&#34; he informed making his way to stand up he needed to leave immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get me the shirt..&#34; he ordered but Layla just kept staring into utter space, when she suddenly held him back to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought long about it and she didn&#39;t want him to leave and go to someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you&#34; Nolan was interrupted as Layla suddenly slammed her lips on his.</p>
