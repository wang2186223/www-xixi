                <p>Keisha was one naughty girl, he had been friends with her long before he became a Lycan king and an Alpha. They happened to be very close friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Carla was kind of his responsibility and he felt the need to take care of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father had died in the war trying to save his life, the same war where he lost his mate Vera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The war happened when he was much younger, he and Vera just mated with each other and he lost her to the cold hands of death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carla lost her father also, that was the reason he took her in and was always lenient with her, though she proved to be very immature at times. She was still his responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The war between the Lycans and werewolves was very fatal and many lost their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a fight for power, the werewolves felt the Lycans couldn&#39;t rule them anymore so they began to rebel against the Lycan king of them which was his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lycans and werewolves were very different in terms of power. Lycans were stronger than the werewolves. Lycans were more superior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While lycans could shift whenever they wanted, werewolves had to wait till the full moon but some werewolves could evolve into Lycans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one Alpha who ruled the whole of the wolves supremacy and that was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the true Alpha and the only Lycan that could be an Alpha, the other alpha&#39;s had to be werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was very unique about a Lycan king and that was that he would bring out his claws and fangs in his human form to act as defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One&#39;s mate usually made them stronger and a Lycan&#39;s mate was like his pillar and would make him more superior but he didn&#39;t want Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled up in front of a big restaurant and Layla sighed in relief that they&#39;ve Finally arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put these on&#34; he handed her a pair of black gloves. They were designers and would stop before her elbow if she wore them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was already putting on a leather glove, in fact he was always wearing one, the only time she had seen him without one was at his house,the hotel and the mall. Apart from those times he was always wearing one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both stepped out of the car and he waited for Layla to come stand beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t speak when you&#39;re not obligated to&#34; he warned and he began to walk towards the restaurant majestically Layla beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two guards were already on standby, ready to receive Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They opened the door wide as Layla and Nolan walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla admired the beauty of the restaurant, a table for four was already set, it looked like a VIP and whoever designed it took their time to do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Alden!!&#34; A man rose up from his chair in seeing Nolan walk in with Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hayes Keith&#34; Nolan called out with a grim expression on his face as Layla stayed very close to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From all the business issues she&#39;s handled, never has she come across the name Hayes Keith, she looked like a very confidential client.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please sit&#34; he offered as one of his men came over to adjust the chair for Nolan and Layla to sit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so happy you considered my invitation and are interested in partnering with my company, I promise never to let you down, Mr Alden&#34; he promised smiling widely, as she showed off his Brown teeth which made Layla scrunch her face in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr Hayes Keith was definitely not the kind of man she would like to work with or handle any of his appointments, he seemed like a pervert, she didn&#39;t like anything about him at all. From his rounded belly and the gold in his canine, she hated men like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Above all the way he continuously kept staring at her, didn&#39;t sit well with her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get straight to the point Hayes, you know I&#39;m a busy man&#34; Nolan spoke out as Hayes chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, that&#39;s true, but first let&#39;s have a glass of wine, I got it on my trip to Vienna, &#34; he said, snapping his fingers in the air as one of his men stepped forward with a bottle of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think that would.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No come one Mr Alden, just a glass&#34; he interrupted as his men served three glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here you go, pretty lady,&#34; he said, offering a glass to Layla, who hesitantly stretched out her hand to accept the cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t drink&#34; Nolan yanked Hayes hands, preventing him from giving Layla the drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I see&#34; Hayes mouthed, withdrawing his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I may ask, who&#39;s she? She&#39;s very pretty &#34; he admired Layla&#39;s beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drink up Hayes, cheers&#34; Nolan lifted the glass in the air as Hayes did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a small sip from the drink and dropped it back in his place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright Mr Alden, as I said in my proposal, I would like to invest in your&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; Nolan chimed in all of a sudden as he kept on looking round the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was not right at all. He could feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His werewolf and Alpha instinct could feel some kind of danger roaming around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayes didn&#39;t just invite them here for a business meeting, he had some ulterior motives of his and it was definitely of no good.</p>
