                <p>Layla&#39;s eyes remained glued to Nolan&#39;s as she stayed unblinking. His icy blue eyes staring deep into her brown ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla soon realized that they&#39;ve been staring into each other&#39;s eyes for quite a long time which made her quite uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleared her throat loudly stepping out of her reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why were you crying earlier?&#34; Nolan suddenly asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Actually that thought has been bothering him as he just couldn&#39;t understand her behavior earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was crying when she was not hurt and even wished that she was the one hurt instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I was worried about you..&#34; came Layla&#39;s honest reply and a dry laugh vibrated out of Nolan&#39;s mouth, which left Layla in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was literally the first time she was seeing him laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Worried!!&#34; He chuckled with a sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the first person that had ever told him those words, that she was worried about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people looked up to him for protection not to worry about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to be worried about me, Layla, worry about yourself..&#34; he drew out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were two different people, she was weak and fragile, while he was strong and could take care of himself anytime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should think about yourself not me..&#34; he said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I can take care of myself just fine, I&#39;m a Lycan, &#34; he reminded her Incase she had forgotten that fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Lycans can also die&#34; she pointed out and Nolan paused..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not immortal so you should take care of yourself too..&#34; she flashed a warm smile at him as she sighed deeply, today has been quite a rough day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know if you find your mate?&#34; Layla asked out of the blue as she wanted to know more about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You get the feeling..&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling was so intense, that something he felt his wolf trying to tear out of him each time Layla appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What feeling?&#34; Layla queried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a feeling of longer, it&#39;s mostly stronger for us Lycans because of our wolf, but for humans like you, you will have a gut feeling, the need to be with a particular person..&#34; he explained to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So we&#39;re mates?&#34; She drew out and he nodded his head affirmatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm, hmm&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gosh..&#34; Layla gasped. That must be the reason for the attraction she usually felt towards him even though she hated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all because of a stupid matewhatever, Layla thought, biting her lips hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m working on severing the mate bond..&#34; he announced and Layla lifted her head up to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sever?&#34; She pursed her lips in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How much more was she going to find out today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes..&#34; he confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A mate bond can be severed..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I see, why don&#39;t we do that?&#34; She proposed her mood lifting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can just reject your mate, if not, I would have done that the moment we met&#34; he snapped coldly at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has to be done on a full moon and today happened to be a full moon..&#34; he said to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you were planning to reject me tonight?&#34; She asked as he affirmed to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!!&#34; Was all Layla could say. If not for the attack that happened, Nolan would have probably taken her to a corner and rejected her. Then everyone goes their separate ways as if nothing ever happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inhaled sharply, this was the first time he was speaking so casually to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually he hardly spoke and when he did, it was to scold her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today they spoke casually and he even laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who knew the almighty Nolan Adlen could laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank God we&#39;re safe&#34; she mumbled, moving her hands to her flat tummy which she rubbed gently. Her child was safe, nothing had happened to him or her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla was still appreciating the fact that she was safe, when something struck her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nolan was a Lycan and also the father of her child, did that mean..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do Lycans come about..&#34; she suddenly asked in horror as she sat up from the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm?&#34; Nolan frowned at her sudden behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she acting so strange all of a sudden? He wondered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you Lycans come about, I mean how do you get your Lycan powers?&#34; She asked anxiously as she anticipated his reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Through birth, a Lycan has to be born, but a werewolf can be bitten..&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A Lycan could only be born, that was what made them more unique and stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no!&#34; Layla gasped as she fell back to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hasn&#39;t freak out since but now she wants to freak out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nolan was a Lycan, that means her child would be one also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt like screaming her lungs out at the sudden discovery. It seems as if things weren&#39;t working in her favor, how could it be!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is anything the problem?&#34; Nolan asked, sensing her tense State.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonono.not at all&#34; Layla faked a smile as she tried to control herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing she wanted was having Nolan suspect her, she needed to play cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned against the other side of the wall as they both sat face to face with each other. Each lost in their own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This can&#39;t be happening, Layla thought in despair, it just couldn&#39;t happen. She has planned on leaving with her child after she gathered enough money but how will she do that now, when her child is the child of a Lycan. Which means she&#39;s birthing one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you&#34; her voice trailed off as she noticed something unusual in Nolan, he had a tensed look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sirwhat&#39;s wrong?&#34; She asked getting up from the ground and she crawled to where he sat. Was the poison having its effects on him again? Did she not burn it out properly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything okay, why did you look tense?&#34; She asked in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was alright dark and she was in a place she had no idea about, so something better not be wrong with him, because she has nowhere to run to for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34;</p>
