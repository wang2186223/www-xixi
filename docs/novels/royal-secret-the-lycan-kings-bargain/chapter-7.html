                <p>&#34;So let&#39;s get this straight,&#34; Aurora began after listening to one hell of an explanation from Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re pregnant, right?&#34; She asked as Layla shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Mike is not the father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many times am I going to tell you that?&#34; Layla pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You caught Mike cheating with Scarlet, so because of that, you got yourself drunk and ended up having a one-night stand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Precisely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you have no idea about the father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;ve never met him before; we just met by accident,&#34; Layla responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you left home because you think Rosalie is a threat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think she is a threat, Aurora, she is,&#34; Layla said. She had experienced the most painful heartbreak; her boyfriend cheated on her with no other woman than her stepsister, who she always thought had her back but had no idea that she was a bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I might wake up one morning and see that she has drilled the baby out of me,&#34; Layla said in a single breath. Rosalie was very hostile and was capable of doing something like that; she can even suggest an abortion and convince her Dad to make her do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True, Rosalie can definitely do that,&#34; Aurora nodded in agreement. She and Layla attended the same high school along with her brother Regan, and they&#39;ve been close friends since then. She has witnessed Rosalie&#39;s hostility towards Layla and can definitely confess to that; Rosalie was wicked and can do stupid things if she has to. She was like the wicked stepmother in fairy tales.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I have no choice than to leave? I can never take a life,&#34; Layla voiced out, rubbing her flat tummy slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree with you, keep the child Layla, and know that you have I and Regan&#39;s support,&#34; Aurora assured, placing her hand on Layla&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umabout that,&#34; Layla began nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell Regan about my pregnancy yet,&#34; Layla requested; she didn&#39;t want to tell anyone about it yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why? Don&#39;t tell me you plan on hiding it? That will not be possible; months from now, you&#39;ll have a bump,&#34; Aurora pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not hiding it; it&#39;s just for the meantime, it should remain a secret between us. At least until I secure a job,&#34; Layla said. She really had to start saving up for the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regan is already working on that, but I think you should still tell him; you have our support, Layla,&#34; Aurora assured softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, but I don&#39;t feel comfortable about it yet. I should start work in earnest so I can get an apartment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to worry about that, Layla; this house is mine, and I live alone. You&#39;re welcome to stay as long as you want. Even when you finally have your baby, I&#39;d be delighted to have you both around, so there&#39;s no need for getting an apartment,&#34; Aurora phrased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, Aurora,&#34; Layla appreciated, feeling teary. Aurora has been like a sister to her and has always been there during the hard times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome, baby girl, Mike, that son of a pig,&#34; Aurora clenched her fist in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare he?&#34; She asked no one in particular.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He deserves a punch straight in the face if his,&#34; she muttered in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, right?&#34; Layla said, yawning; she was feeling so tired. She has not had a decent rest for the past two days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m tired,&#34; she yawned, standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it must be because of your trip; go to your room and have some rest; breakfast will be ready once you wake up,&#34; Aurora informed as Layla smiled brightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; she mouthed, walking sluggishly to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla woke up to the sound of the alarm, yawning, she climbed off the bed, walking sluggishly to the bathroom to relieve herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to go back to bed when the smell of waffles wafted through her nose, making her stomach grumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked to the kitchen, but was surprised to see Regan there flipping a pancake with an apron tied around his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Regan,&#34; she called in surprise, not expecting to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning, sleepyhead,&#34; he flashed a smile at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t expect to see you here,&#34; she confessed as he chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to make you breakfast,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh good gracious, I can&#39;t wait,&#34; Layla salivated; Regan was a very good cook, even better than his sister and her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve missed your cooking,&#34; she confessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should, I&#39;m the best after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wish,&#34; she teased, and they both laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Aurora?&#34; Layla asked, looking around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s probably still sleeping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m right here,&#34; Aurora said loudly, walking out of her room, banging the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; She asked Regan directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to make Layla breakfast; I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not blind,&#34; he smiled at her as Aurora sent him a hard glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just so you know, two grown-up women are now living here, so you just can&#39;t barge in whenever you like; we have our privacy,&#34; Aurora drew out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean who comes into a woman&#39;s house unannounced; so please drop my house key when you&#39;re leaving and call whenever you&#39;re coming over again,&#34; Aurora instructed with a note of finality in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s your breakfast,&#34; Regan said to Layla, ignoring Aurora as he placed a plate of pancakes with strawberry and chocolate toppings in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat up,&#34; he gestured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too Aurora, sit, I&#39;ll serve you yours,&#34; he informed as Aurora sat beside Layla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you come this early, hmm?&#34; She questioned curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I came with good news,&#34; he began as Layla raised her head up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good news?&#34; She queried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, and it&#39;s for you, Layla,&#34; he responded, his face beaming with smiles as Layla wondered what good news he must have brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So go and tell us, what&#39;s the good news?&#34; Aurora motioned eager to know what he was planning to say as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a friend who works as a manager in Raleigh company; I talked to him about you. Luckily for you, there happened to be a vacant space, so you got the job,&#34; he announced happily as Layla squealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, and you&#39;re starting work today,&#34; he informed; Layla stilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, today?&#34; Layla yelled in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, tod.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you didn&#39;t tell me about it!!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever, thanks Regan, you&#39;re a lifesaver,&#34; Layla appreciated running to her room to get dressed for work.</p>
