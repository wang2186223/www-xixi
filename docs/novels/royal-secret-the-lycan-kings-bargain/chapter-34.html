                <p>Layla quickly ran back to Nolan after finding the lighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir.&#34; She knelt in front of him as she panicked. The blue color on his skin was slowly spreading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve gotten the lighter&#34; she quivered, placing her shaky hands on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Burn it out..&#34; he said in a ragged breath. Layla needed to burn the poison out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Burn what out?What about the bullets you&#39;ve been shot at!&#34; She exclaimed, breathing hard. What did he seriously want to get burned out? How did he even expect her to burn a human skin, she would literally pass out in the process of doing so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The poison for fuck sake!&#34; Nolan gritted his teeth in pain. The Poison was spreading rapidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you expect me to do that?&#34; Layla muttered, she would not be strong enough to do that. She can&#39;t even stand seeing someone in pain, how can she be the cause of inflicting pain on Someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you want me dead&#34; Nolan grunted in sarcasm, he was the one hurt, yet she was the one complaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, no, I don&#39;t want you dead&#34; Layla stuttered. If he eventually died, what was she going to do about it? Everything was going to be her fault, because he took the bullet for her. If not for her, all these wouldn&#39;t have happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then get to work immediately and burn that damn poison out of me &#34; he hissed annoyed at her behavior. She should get done with it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can I&#34; Layla&#39;s voice broke off as she felt a lump on her throat. The poison was already spreading as some parts of his skin were already Turning blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla&#34; he drew out smacking his lips. He just couldn&#39;t fathom what the hell was wrong with her. He was the one hurt, not her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is all my fault&#34; Layla murmured as a tear dropped from her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34; He exclaimed in disbelief, he was hurt but she was crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re hurt because of me, I&#39;m so sorry..&#34; she choked on her words feeling very sad, she caused all of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what?&#34; Nolan began,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should have allowed you to get shot, isn&#39;t it?&#34; He just couldn&#39;t understand her naiveness, if she had gotten shot, she would have died on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,I.&#34; Layla sniffled, she didn&#39;t like someone getting hurt because of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be stupid Layla..&#34; he scoffed, holding her hand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already witnessed all that happened tonight and so you can tell that, I&#39;m no ordinary being, burn it out for fuck sake, I&#39;ll heal!&#34; He yelled angrily. Her behavior really irked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No buts Layla, I&#39;ll be fine, but I&#39;ll die if you leave this poison inside of me..&#34; he deadpanned hoping that would sink into her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should call a doctor..&#34; she suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Layla..&#34; Nolan called in a stern voice as she looked up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Burn it out..&#34; he commanded in a growl, his eyes color flickering from its usual blue to dark red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok I will.&#34; Layla screamed and she put on the lighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just position it towards my wounds..&#34; he instructed as Layla did just as he had instructed. She closed her eyes throughout the process, as she couldn&#39;t bring herself to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held low groans from him as she burnt out the poison, few minutes later, she stilled as she was no longer hearing any sounds from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir..&#34; she called, opening her eyes slowly as she tapped him gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir..&#34; she tapped him again in fear that he was dead as his eyes were closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Si, haaa!!!!&#34; Layla yelled in shock, falling to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his eyes and his eyes colors scared her, they were red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are your eyes red?&#34; She asked horrified, instead of the usual blue his eyes were red, and that freaked her out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What more was she going to see tonight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;m a Lycan&#34; came his sincere reply as his claws snapped out of his fingertips, giving Layla the hundredth shock of that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A what?&#34; She gasped in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A Lycan..&#34; he answered, placing his claws into his open wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Layla asked, eyes wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you thinking of leaving the bullets inside of me?&#34; He raised a brow at her as he brought out a bullet with his claws which made Layla scrunch her face up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God..&#34; she sat on the ground not knowing what to think or do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should be freaking out and screaming at the top of her lungs but strangely she was calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She marveled why it was so, it was probably because she just that the father of her child is a freaking Lycan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat in amusement watching him as he pulled out the bullets not knowing what to say or think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he was done, he rested against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now what?, I should get a bandage or something&#34; Layla offered, making her way to stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need..&#34; he spoke out as she glanced at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but wonder why he still looked smoking hot after he just escaped death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His abs were.oh gosh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not to talk of the tattoo inking his skin, something she has never seen before or even knew he had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tattoo covered almost half of his chest and his left arm stopped at his wrist. She never noticed it before because he was always on sleeves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nonetheless she liked his tattoo, it made him look hotter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; She pursed her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;ll heal soon&#34; he informed and her eyes grew wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only did his eyes turn red he also healed. Cool! Was the only word she could think of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About five minutes later, his wounds began to close up and all Layla could do was watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe this..&#34; she mouthed trying hard not to believe what was unfolding before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to Layla..&#34; his lips pulled up in mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things definitely didn&#39;t go the way he planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides you&#39;re mated to one&#34;</p>
