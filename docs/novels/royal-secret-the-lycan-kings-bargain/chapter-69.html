                <p>&#34;Good morning Maddox..&#34; Layla yawned as she stepped out from her room. Maddox was already waiting by her door as he wagged its tail the moment Layla stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well that can be kind of confusing since Layla had always been scared of Maddox, but during the last two days they&#39;ve become best of friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layla had reportedly gotten over her fear for him as she realized that he was really a sweet dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you doing today?&#34; Layla asked squatting In front of him as she rubbed his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoof!&#34; Maddox barked which shocked Layla a little bit and she fell on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it Maddox, I thought I told you not to do that..&#34; she frowned as she sat in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always startle me each time you bark at me unexpectedly..&#34; she complained and Maddox seemed to have heard her complaints as he began to wince softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nudged towards her as he rubbed his soft fur on her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry I forgive you okay..&#34; she smiled, patting his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s how Layla has been living her life for two days now, neither had she stepped out from the house nor has she seen Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what happened at the office and he told her to leave, Layla had not caught not even a glance of him. He did not show up nor did he call to tell her about his whereabouts. He just left her with Maddox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well Layla didn&#39;t bother to call him either. She didn&#39;t care if he was away, in fact she was glad. She was only sad because she had no idea if he would allow her resume work again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It kind of felt relaxing for her that he was not at home. No work, just sleep, rest and play. Though it was kind of boring being alone at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would have loved to move to Aurora&#39;s place to crash but she couldn&#39;t leave Maddox alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There will be no one to feed or bathe him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on..&#34; she sighed, getting up from the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go to the kitchen to get some food..&#34; both Layla and Maddox headed to the kitchen and she began to make breakfast for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what do we have here?&#34; She asked herself opening the cabinet where Maddox feed was usually being kept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no!!&#34; She groaned in frustration. Maddox was out of feed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a problem, dox&#34; she announced, calling Maddox by the nickname she gave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddox seemed to have understood what she said as he sat up from the ground and walked to where she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re such a smart dog&#34; she admired rubbing his head. He seemed to understand everything that went on. Everything she said. And she was really impressed by that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did we do?&#34; She questioned no one in particular. There was no way she would starve Maddox. She didn&#39;t even know where Nolan was or when he would even come back. What she knew at the moment was that she was not going to call Nolan for any reason and she would also look for a way to get out of the mess she was in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess the only solution is to get you some&#34; she said as she had decided to go buy some feed for Maddox.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a grocery store which was not too far from Nolan&#39;s place. She would be able to get there in thirty minutes by foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok Maddie, I&#39;ll go get you some food. Hmm&#34; she patted his head as she went over to switch off the stove. She would prepare her food along with Maddox&#39;s once she gets back from the grocery store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rushing to her room, she quickly changed into comfortable clothes and she made her way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got to the sitting room when she realized she had no cash on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh f*ck this is very frustrating..&#34; she groaned in frustration. She had only a few bucks in her that wouldn&#39;t even be able to buy Maddox&#39;s plate that he used for feeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan bought expensive dog treats for him and that was exactly what she was planning to get from the grocery store. As she wanted to avoid Nolan&#39;s trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to get on his bad side by buying any random feed for Maddox. Then Nolan would lash out on her for feeding his dog with something cheap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddox was very healthy and big. As Nolan made sure to maintain him well enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still thinking of where to find money to buy dog treats for Maddox when her eyes caught something. Nolan&#39;s card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same card he gave her the day she came to this house. She refused saying she didn&#39;t want it but Nolan had left it there. He didn&#39;t bother to collect it back as he just dumped it on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank God..&#34; breathing a sigh of relief, Layla rushed to the table and collected the black card that was lying on it. She was doing this for Maddox, not herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be good Maddox..&#34; She waved while walking to the door but she discovered that Maddox was following her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go back, I&#39;ll be back soon..&#34; she tried warding him off but he didn&#39;t bulge. It seems as if he was intent on following her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right, all right, you can come with me..&#34; she said, picking up his leash which she attached to his collar. The dog was just as stubborn as its owner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go..&#34; she voiced out as she came out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brace up boy. It&#39;s going to be a long walk..&#34; she informed. She had no plans or taking a taxi. She was walking to the grocery store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Take it as a stroll or an early morning exercise.</p>
