                <p>The person on the other end of the phone was very noisy, but it was relatively quiet on Alvin&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, Alvin hung up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked down at the seven-colored flower specimen in his hand with a self-mocking smile.</p>

                <p>Although Margaret was somewhat dissatisfied, Nina&#39;s happiness was the most important thing.</p>

                <p>During this month, the two traveled everywhere, enjoying their sweet time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the evening, after coming out of Sweetie&#39;s room, Isabella received dozens of travel photos from Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of them were scenic photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella was looking at them enviously when Seb put his arm around her shoulder, &#34;What are you looking at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Photos from Nina.&#34; Isabella handed the phone over and flipped through the photos for him, &#34;Nina said she and Richard are now in the Arctic. These photos were taken on-site. Look, aren&#39;t they as beautiful as wallpapers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re pretty nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella&#39;s eyes showed a look of envy, &#34;Nina said it&#39;s very cold there. Even wearing two down jackets, she still feels cold. She also said they are going to see the Northern Lights tonight and will take photos and videos for me. It must be beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think Nina and Richard are so happy? I believe Nina must be very happy now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess Richard will propose abroad. Don&#39;t you think so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you keep saying yes?&#34; Isabella felt that Seb was becoming more like a robot. Every time she talked to him about Nina and Richard recently, he would just say &#34;yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb rubbed her fingers with a smile, &#34;I just think you&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella felt a bit stifled, &#34;Seb, are you tired of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb laughed, &#34;No way. Don&#39;t overthink it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just feel like you&#39;re tired of me. You&#39;ve been brushing me off lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m really not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella wanted to say more, but suddenly there was a knock on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knock was urgent and sharp, making people feel uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The couple exchanged a glance, &#34;Who could it be so late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb got up, &#34;I&#39;ll get the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella also stood up, &#34;I&#39;ll go with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the door opened, both Seb and Isabella were a bit stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kelsey? What are you doing here so late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bella.&#34; Kelsey started crying loudly as soon as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella and Seb let Kelsey into the house. Seb poured her some juice, and Isabella handed her a box of tissues to wipe her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Kelsey calmed down a bit, Isabella asked, &#34;Did you have a fight with Jack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella&#39;s question made Kelsey start crying again. &#34;Bella, he wants to break up with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Break up? Why would he want to break up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey cried even harder, &#34;He&#39;s going back to get married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? You&#39;re his girlfriend. If he&#39;s getting married and not to you, then to whom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nancy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!&#34; Isabella was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb, on the side, was also incredulous, &#34;You must be mistaken. Nancy is Jack&#39;s sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack was adopted by the Wilso family. He has no blood relation to Nancy. Now the Wilso family is forcing him to marry, and Jack agreed. He wants to break up with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey had always been pampered by her family and had only experienced one setback in her love life with Seb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone around could see Kelsey&#39;s feelings for Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Jack was going to marry someone else, it was indeed a big blow to Kelsey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella comforted her, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Let Seb call to find out what&#39;s going on. Jack is Seb&#39;s subordinate; he will definitely listen to Seb.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This suggestion worked. Kelsey gradually stopped crying, &#34;But Jack is the kind of person who always keeps his promises. Will he really listen to Seb?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella couldn&#39;t guarantee it, but they had to let Seb try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if there was another reason?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if Jack changed his mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like she and Seb, after going through so much and clearing up misunderstandings, everything turned out fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella didn&#39;t want Kelsey to suffer as much in love as she and Nina did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb immediately in front of Kelsey dialed Jack&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Landon.&#34; Jack&#39;s voice came through the receiver, and Kelsey bit her lip, looking at the phone nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on between you and Kelsey?&#34; Seb asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long silence on the other end before Jack&#39;s voice came through, &#34;Is she with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please take care of her, and don&#39;t let her go back alone this late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb frowned, &#34;She&#39;s your girlfriend, so you should take care of her yourself. Where are you now? No matter where you are, come and pick her up immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, Mr. Landon, I can&#39;t leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack, I&#39;m hungry,&#34; Nancy&#39;s voice suddenly came from the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey grabbed Seb&#39;s phone, and shouted into it, &#34;Jack, I&#39;m asking you one last time, are you really going to marry Nancy and break up with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Kelsey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack, if you want to break up, then let&#39;s break up. Whether you regret it in the future or not, I just want to tell you, never come back to find me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Kelsey hung up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, Kelsey stood there, looking like she had lost her soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella held her arm, &#34;Kelsey, don&#39;t be in a hurry. Tomorrow I&#39;ll ask him face to face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need.&#34; Kelsey&#39;s tears fell, &#34;Bella, I loved him so much, and even lowered myself for him repeatedly. Why does he have to treat me like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never like him again. If he wants to get married, let him.&#34; Kelsey wiped away her tears, &#34;I&#39;m going home now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Isabella and Seb chased after her, Kelsey had already driven away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried about Kelsey&#39;s safety, Isabella and Seb followed her in their car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Kelsey drive to a bar, Isabella became concerned, &#34;I&#39;ll go to check on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb stopped her, looked up at the bar&#39;s sign, and explained, &#34;This bar belongs to Michael. Don&#39;t worry, Kelsey won&#39;t be in any trouble on his turf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, it was Richard&#39;s, but later, when Richard got too busy, he handed it over to Michael to manage, and eventually, it became Michael&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, tonight, Michael wasn&#39;t there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Richard went to Silvercrest, Michael had been handling affairs in Lakina, and the busiest, most profitable, and most chaotic place was the No. 1 Casino.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael had been there every day recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bar was left in the hands of two of Michael&#39;s subordinates, who happened to know Kelsey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment Kelsey walked in, they kept an eye on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey ordered two drinks, sat in a booth, and started drinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When a man approached her, she cursed him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she cursed, she started crying again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing something was wrong, the two immediately called Michael.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes passed, Isabella and Seb were still sitting in the car, not seeing Kelsey come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After another minute, Isabella reached for the car door, &#34;I can&#39;t wait any longer. I need to find Kelsey. What if she gets bullied?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb said, &#34;I&#39;ll go with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they could get out of the car, they heard the roar of a motorcycle speeding down the street. In just a few seconds, a black motorcycle zoomed by like a black lightning bolt, leaving a trail in the dim night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the bar entrance, the motorcycle made a sharp turn, leaving a skid mark on the ground, and came to a stylish stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair of black boots hit the ground, and the man took off his helmet, revealing a handsome face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Michael!&#34; Isabella was about to get out of the car but was stopped by Seb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked back at him, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb watched Michael stride into the bar and voiced, &#34;You know Michael likes Kelsey, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Isabella nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time Michael saw Kelsey, his eyes were so intense that he seemed to want to devour her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Isabella couldn&#39;t see that, she would be truly blind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought for a moment, &#34;If Jack doesn&#39;t work out, Michael is a good choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Michael rush in like that, he must know Kelsey is inside. The fact that he dropped everything to come immediately shows he won&#39;t let Kelsey get hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb smiled, &#34;So, should we still find her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella sat back in her seat, &#34;No, let&#39;s go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before we go home, there&#39;s something I want to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb took out his phone, tapped a few times, then handed it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this?&#34; Isabella glanced at the phone, &#34;Plane tickets?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she saw the details, her eyes widened, &#34;Isabella? Seb? Sweetie? What&#39;s this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to invite you and Sweetie to see the Northern Lights together.&#34; Seb uttered gently, &#34;I&#39;ve arranged everything at the company. If you have no objections, we can leave in three days. If we&#39;re lucky, we might even run into Nina and Richard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella was excited, her eyes welling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seb, you&#39;re so wonderful.&#34; She leaned over and hugged Seb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb gently hugged her back, &#34;I&#39;m not perfect, but I&#39;ll keep improving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella smiled happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey had drunk too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lay on the sofa, her tears still wet on her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kelsey? Get up!&#34; Someone was calling her, but she was too lazy to move, too lazy to respond. &#34;Kelsey!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That person was so annoying, like a fly buzzing in her ear, even shaking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey finally opened her eyes impatiently and saw a tall figure through the blurry lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Michael?&#34; Kelsey mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael patted her cheek with his palm, &#34;Get up! I&#39;ll take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey was a bit confused, her brain not fully under her control, but surprisingly obedient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he said to get up, she climbed off the sofa, but after sitting up, she felt dizzy and fell back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t,&#34; she waved her hand, &#34;I&#39;m so dizzy, I can&#39;t stand up. I&#39;ll just sleep here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael didn&#39;t force her. He stared at her for a while and then asked, &#34;How about I call your boyfriend? Let him get you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Kelsey screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The term &#34;boyfriend&#34; was a huge humiliation for her at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She curled up and murmured softly, &#34;I don&#39;t have a boyfriend anymore. I just got dumped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The music was too loud for Michael to hear her clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seeing her lips move, he was curious about what she was saying, so he squatted down in front of the sofa and leaned in to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time he heard her clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael brushed his fingers across Kelsey&#39;s face, &#34;You broke up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey half-opened her eyes, looking very hurt, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael raised an eyebrow, &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey pressed her lips together, unwilling to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael chuckled, &#34;You broke up with him and made yourself look so miserable. This isn&#39;t like the Kelsey I know. Shouldn&#39;t you have slapped him twice and walked away coolly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears slid down from the corner of her eyes, and she mumbled, &#34;I couldn&#39;t do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Michael&#39;s heart almost broke. He couldn&#39;t help but stroke her forehead, &#34;Do you love him that much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey just cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael sighed, &#34;If a man doesn&#39;t behave, just replace him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Replace him?&#34; Kelsey sobbed, &#34;With whom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael laughed, &#34;With me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them were silent for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey didn&#39;t know if she was scared awake by his words, but now her eyes were wide open, staring at Michael without blinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Michael broke the silence with a smile, &#34;Are you sober now? Let&#39;s go, I&#39;ll take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to get up, Kelsey suddenly grabbed his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she hooked her arms around his neck and kissed Michael on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael was stunned, holding her shoulders to pull her back a bit, staring at her, &#34;Kelsey, don&#39;t mess with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, Kelsey kissed him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey&#39;s lips were soft and tender, even more so than he had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael had been waiting for this for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her taking the initiative, Michael immediately surrendered. He cupped the back of her head with his palm, pressed her hard into the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey was dizzy from his kiss, but her eyes kept glancing in a certain direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just now, Jack was standing in that spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a pang of sadness, Kelsey fainted in Michael&#39;s arms due to a lack of oxygen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, Margaret arranged dinner and invited Isabella and Seb to bring Sweetie over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Kelsey brought Michael back and introduced him as her new boyfriend, the whole family was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret was still against their relationship. Compared to Kelsey dating Jack, she was even more opposed to Kelsey dating Michael.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kelsey was very determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During dinner, when Isabella mentioned they were going to see the Northern Lights, Kelsey turned to Michael and asked, &#34;Let&#39;s go too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when everyone thought Michael wouldn&#39;t go along with her craziness, Michael nodded, &#34;Okay. I&#39;ll make the arrangements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was even more puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Kelsey and Michael confirmed their relationship, they moved in together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jack heard the news, he didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s family was busy preparing for his wedding. The day before he was to get married, he voluntarily resigned to Seb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack said he was going back to repay a debt of gratitude and would stay with his family from then on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seb and Isabella prepared a gift for him, and Seb voiced, &#34;Your position at the Landon Group will always be open for you. Whenever you want to come back, you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella and Seb, Michael and Kelsey, the four of them boarded a plane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack went home to hold his wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zaire rushed back from out of town, upon learning everything, sighed, &#34;You all have no conscience, going to see the Northern Lights without me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret added beside him, &#34;They&#39;re all couples going to see the Northern Lights. It&#39;s such a romantic thing. Why would they take a single person like you? To make a wish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zaire laughed helplessly, &#34;Mom, why are you so against me now? If I wanted a wife, it would be easy. If I waved my hand, the line of women wanting to be my wife would stretch from here to another country!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret waved her hand, &#34;I only want Miley to be your wife. I don&#39;t approve of anyone else. If you can&#39;t marry Miley, you&#39;ll stay single for the rest of your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Zaire found out that Miley had removed him from her blacklist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He checked her status page, seeing that Miley had just posted a minute ago, [Going on my 256th date tomorrow. Wish me luck.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zaire silently gave it a like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A minute later, Miley blocked him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Margaret woke up to find Zaire gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bed was neatly made, and his suitcase and some daily clothes were missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret called him, and Zaire laughed, &#34;I know you&#39;re anxious, but don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m going to bring Miley back for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? I&#39;m getting old, don&#39;t fool me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margaret was overjoyed, &#34;Then I&#39;ll wait at home for your good news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zaire said, &#34;Don&#39;t just wait around. I&#39;m planning to take her to join Kelsey, Seb, and the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, Seeing the Northern Lights is great. I fully support it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A year later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wedding of the Jose family&#39;s son and daughter made headlines nationwide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina and Richard, Zaire and Miley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two couples held a joint wedding, and the event was indescribably luxurious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jack walked into his house carrying a grocery basket, the phone on the sofa was still streaming the wedding live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen happened to show a familiar figure, and someone in the comments said, [Wow, is that Kelsey from the Jose family? She&#39;s so beautiful!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s eyes softened as he stared at Kelsey, unable to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But soon, the camera cut to another scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wedding was so grand that the media wouldn&#39;t focus solely on Kelsey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of disappointment flashed in Jack&#39;s eyes as he quietly turned off the phone, plunging the room into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to head to the kitchen when he suddenly heard the sounds of lovemaking from the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s steps froze. He walked to the bedroom, pushing it open. The couple on the bed was startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man, seeing Jack, panicked and tried to find his pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman, however, wrapped her legs tightly around the man&#39;s waist and said coquettishly, &#34;Don&#39;t mind him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he&#39;s your husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He won&#39;t be for long,&#34; the woman answered seductively, &#34;Let&#39;s continue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack walked in, grabbed the man from the bed, and gave him a severe beating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the divorce agreement. Sign it, and we will have nothing to do with each other anymore.&#34; Nancy threw the pen on the table, her eyes fixed on Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack said nothing. Just as he picked up the pen, Nancy rushed to slap it out of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack bent down to pick it up, and Nancy, like a madwoman, kept hitting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack picked up the pen and restrained her wrist, &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy burst into tears, &#34;Jack! We&#39;ve been married for a year, but you won&#39;t make love to me! Can&#39;t I find another man to satisfy my needs? I know you were forced to marry me, but we&#39;re already married. Can&#39;t you respect me as your wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack lowered his eyes, &#34;Why are you saying this now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy shook her head and hugged him, pleading, &#34;Jack, I was confused for a moment for donig this. Please forgive me this once. If you treat me well as your wife from now on, I promise to be faithful and never mess around again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack pried her hands off, &#34;No need. I&#39;ve repaid my debt to the Wilso family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! You can never repay what you owe the Wilso family! I don&#39;t want a divorce! Jack, I love you. I just needed to vent. I&#39;m a woman with normal sexual needs. Please forgive me this once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once?&#34; Jack looked at her coldly, &#34;Was it really just once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How many times exactly, she couldn&#39;t even count.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack.&#34; Nancy&#39;s tears flowed like rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack signed the divorce agreement, packed his things, and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in his car, he thought about calling Nancy&#39;s mother to stay with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could dial, he saw a man rushing upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey was happy and had a bit to drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to drink more, but Michael stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the wedding, they walked hand in hand along the roadside, leaving their car behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they got tired, they sat on a bench to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Michael.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want some cake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael nodded, &#34;I&#39;ll go buy some.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him walk away, Kelsey felt a sudden pang of sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the past year, Michael had been really good to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He treated her almost like a child, pampering her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had also gradually changed her parents&#39; prejudices against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Michael was recognized by everyone as Kelsey&#39;s future husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, the wedding of Zaire and Nina had a big impact on Kelsey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered if it was time for her to settle down too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey saw a blind person trying to cross the street, but because the tactile paving was blocked by something, the blind person was anxiously turning in circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the countdown on the green light, Kelsey ran over, helping the person across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blind person kept bowing and thanking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey helped him to the tactile paving and watched him leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she saw a familiar figure standing on the left side of the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Jack!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey&#39;s heart skipped a beat. Unexpected reunions always catch people off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelsey instinctively wanted to walk over, but she suddenly sensed something and turned to the right. She saw Michael standing at the right corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Michael had also seen Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the pedestrian light was green. Michael was holding a cake but didn&#39;t walk over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michael and Jack stood at two different corners, two different paths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city&#39;s neon lights flickered, and Kelsey stood at the intersection, unsure which way to go.</p>
