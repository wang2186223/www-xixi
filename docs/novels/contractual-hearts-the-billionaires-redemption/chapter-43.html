                <p>&#34;Mm&#34; Sherry hummed, not in the mood to entertain him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry lay down on the couch and covered herself with a blanket, she closed her eyes to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was watching her movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come and sleep beside me,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need, i might accidentally touch your wounds if i do that&#34; She responded with her eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised an eyebrow, is she giving me a cold shoulder?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bed was large enough to contain three people, so she was just giving excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry&#34; Bryan called but she didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He noticed that her breathing is now even, so he understood that she had fallen asleep So he also closed his eyes to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure laying down on the couch opened her eyes when she saw that he had fallen asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the ceiling in deep thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is she not making a mistake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept asking this question but she didn&#39;t get an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was really afraid that if Bryan also turned out to be like the people she trusted and gave her heart to, she would be betrayed and she was not sure if she would be able to do it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew what she went through three years ago with that person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know when she would fall asleep with questions in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Sherry opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was a chest in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was terrified and quickly woke up, clear minded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around and saw that she was on the bed, tightly embraced by Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was pissed. She was sleeping on the couch last night. How did she get to the bed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she didn&#39;t even know or notice anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Bryan&#39;s face, he looked so handsome with his eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyebrows were full, curly and long she put her hand and traced his eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>God is really unfair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He has such a beautiful eyebrow and it was full and dark while her eyebrow was very little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She admired his face and her eyes landed on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked soft and pink, she felt like taking a bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pecked his lips lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t do anything bad right? He will be her husband soon anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to seduce me?&#34; Bryan asked, his voice sounded hoarse and seductive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, he had already awoken before Sherry but he closed his eyes when he noticed that she was about to wake up and pretended like he was still sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed, when she realized that he caught her red handed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to push him away so she could run away but he held her tightly, she could only struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan changed their position, he lay on top of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm? You are not answering?&#34; He whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry licked her lips, feeling nervous and opened her mouth to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan Adams&#39; apple bobbled, his eyes became darker when he saw her reaction. He sealed his lips with her and kissed her wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan imprisoned her ferociously, he pried open her teeth and violently held her captive as he deepened the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bed was very soft. Bryan&#39;s movements were getting heavier and his hands were all over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shuddered, she was not wearing anything underneath</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His rough palms brushed past her sensitive areas and it caused her body to shiver. She tried to struggle but she was firmly held down by Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt like she would die from suffocation before he finally released her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry tried to move when she noticed that something hard was pressing her thigh, puzzled she moved her hand to see what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed it, Bryan gritted his teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop&#34; Bryan said, gritting his teeth, if not because of his damn leg he would have pressed her down and had his way with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Sherry asked innocently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at his face, she saw that his forehead was full of sweat like he was enduring some discomfort, she suddenly realized what she was holding, she quickly released it and looked at him pitifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was scared if he did it, she was not sure that she would be able to walk for a while but she didn&#39;t know that the pitiful look on her face made Bryan want to bully her more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pecked his lips, catching him off guard before pushing him away, she quickly stood up from the bed and arranged her messy clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s attention quickly went back to him, &#34;Are you alright? Did I touch your wounds?&#34; Sherry asked with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at her sullenly, &#34;Help me to the bathroom&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay&#34; Sherry nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan put a hand on her shoulder, Sherry helped him to the bathroom, he sat down on the jacuzzi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was about to walk out of the bathroom, when he held her back, she fell in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-at are you d-doing?&#34; Sherry stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wifey, help me&#34; He looked at me with a pitiful face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was confused, &#34;To do what?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan guided her hand towards his crotch, Sherry tried to move her hand from his hold but he held her tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling&#34; He looked at her with a pitiful face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart melted when she saw his adorable face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I have never done it before,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she was not a virgin, she had never touched it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan knew that she had relented and said happily, &#34;I&#39;ll guide you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry muttered an &#39;Oh&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll help you just this once only,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay!&#34; Bryan agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He guided her hand towards his crotch again, Sherry blushed and allowed him to do whatever he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they finished Sherry&#39;s hand was aching badly. She felt like she could not use her hand to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Bryan and saw that he was looking refreshed and energized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shameless man!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry cursed him multiple times in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan took his bath and Sherry helped him out of the bathroom once he was done. Then she went to take her bath and changed her clothes inside the bathroom before going out of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have already called Calvin, he would come over and drive us to register our marriage&#34; Bryan said when he saw Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him with concern, &#34;Can you handle it? Your wounds&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded, &#34;I&#39;m fine&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knock</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, a doctor walked in with a nurse beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Mr and Mrs Tony&#34; The doctor bowed respectfully to them.</p>
