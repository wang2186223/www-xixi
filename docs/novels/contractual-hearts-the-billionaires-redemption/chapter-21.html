                <p>It has been three days since Bryan last saw Sherry. He thought she was trying to avoid him so he didn&#39;t bother to look for her But the estate security guard told him he has not seen her since that night she came home drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan decided to call her school to ask about her but they said she hasn&#39;t come to school since three days ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan decided to check her in her room, he knocked but no one replied When he tried to open the door he realized that it was locked from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went to his room to bring his spare key and opened the door but no one was there, her room was neat and there was no sign of struggle or anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to walk out of her room, when his eyes landed on the bathroom, he decided to check there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the bathroom door and walked into it, he saw a figure laying down on the bathtub, blood water surrounded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was very shocked, &#34;Sherry!&#34; He yelled and ran towards her but there was no response from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted her up not caring about whether his white suit would get stained or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He observed her and saw that there were just tiny breaths on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Did she try to commit suicide?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Was he too harsh that night?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly rushed to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers dug deep into the blanket under her body. Sherry&#39;s body was soaked with sweat. She felt a sharp pain in her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could still hear the student cursing her in her high school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thief, you are bitchy thief&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So even your breast is fake I&#39;m sure even your buttock will be fake too&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s touch it to see if it is fake or not&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was pointing fingers at her and everyone was looking at her with disgust in their eyes, no one believed that she didn&#39;t do any of that. It was Wendy who framed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, confess or we will go and report you to the principal for using something so your breast could bigger, because you want to use it to seduce people&#34; Wendy smirked at her with a hint of arrogance in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People keep cursing her and calling her a lot of disgusting names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I didn&#39;t do it..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was half asleep on the couch in the hospital when he suddenly heard her desperate voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught her hands that were digging deep into the blanket so she wouldn&#39;t hurt herself..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine&#34; Bryan comforted her in a low tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiped her sweat gently with his handkerchief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s face was covered in tears, she slowly opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was Bryan&#39;s hand that was holding hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are awake?&#34; Bryan asked when he saw that she opened her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart started beating fast when she saw his gentle expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan poured her a glass of lukewarm water and placed it on the table beside him, he slowly helped her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry took the lukewarm water in a daze and drank it slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put the glass on the table after she finished drinking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time to settle the account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you tried to commit suicide?&#34; Bryan glared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh? Commit suicide?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him a little confused when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to recall what happened when she started remembering everything, when she got her period, when she went to buy some tampons and met Jackson.. When Jackson left and when she saw Jackson and Wendy at the narrow part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan became a little furious when he saw her confused expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knows she is in the wrong, she doesn&#39;t know what to say She quickly formed her puppy face which no one could resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph! She was sure Bryan won&#39;t be able to resist it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her, she pouted and looked at him with her puppy face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan felt his anger reducing, his eyes turned red when he saw the way she was acting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat and forced his face to be stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or were you so happy when you kissed your boyfriend that you almost committed suicide out of excitement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him a little confused when she heard this,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boyfriend?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have any boyfriend right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or did she get a boyfriend without her knowing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have a boyfriend&#34; Sherry replied her voice came out hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then how do you explain this picture?&#34; He unlocked his phone and showed her a picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry took his phone and stared at the picture, it was a picture of her and Jackson inside the cafe, when he tried to peck she shrank back but the picture looked suggestive it showed like they were really kissing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We didn&#39;t do this&#34; Sherry looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was still the same like he didn&#39;t hear what she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled bitterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew he wouldn&#39;t believe her either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They never did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she already stopped trying to make them believe her, but why does her heart hurt so much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe you,&#34; Bryan said after a few minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry fell into a daze when she heard this. She blinked her eyes and looked at him &#34;You believed me..?&#34; She stared at him intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is right. You are my wife so I should believe you&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt a little happy when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahem!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked up in surprise when she heard this and saw Grandma standing at the door with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry understood when she saw her, it was not that she believed her but he just had to say that because his Grandma is here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how did he know that his Grandma is here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even know that his Grandma was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan stood up from the couch, &#34;I&#39;ll go and get her something to eat&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma smiled and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan walked out of the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sister-in-law and Brother Bryan looked great together like they were match made from heaven&#34; A gentle voice behind Grandma said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry raised her head and looked at the entrance of the ward. Sherry immediately saw Flow in a yellow dress standing on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right&#34; Grandma agreed and walked towards her with a warm smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good girl, how are you feeling now?&#34; Grandma asked with concern in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma I&#39;m fine now&#34; Sherry smiled warmly when she saw the concern in Grandma&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was it that brat who bullied you? Tell me if he is the one I&#39;ll discipline him for you&#34; Grandma held her hand tenderly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he never bullied me,&#34; Sherry quickly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma you are being biased towards Brother Bryan&#34; Flow interrupted them with a gentle smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fist tightly when she saw the scene in front of her. She was the one who was supposed to be enjoying all this but that bitch!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fist tightly to feel the pain so she wouldn&#39;t reveal anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was because her Brother Bryan ignored her too. He acted like he didn&#39;t see her when he walked out of the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Gladys walked into the ward with a bag in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled warmly at Sherry before opening the bag in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was surprised when she brought out what was inside the bag.</p>
