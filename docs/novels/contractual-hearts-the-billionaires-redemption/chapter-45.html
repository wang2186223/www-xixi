                <p>Sherry sighed, she got out of the car and followed him into the store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An attendant walked towards them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi sir and ma&#39;am, What do you need?&#34; The attendant asked respectfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring out your diamond rings,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok sir&#34; The attendant said and quickly walked into the warehouse, she came back in a few minutes with a tray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put the tray in front of Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan started checking them out with a serious expression, he raised his head and glanced at Sherry after selecting three types of rings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which one do you like most?&#34; He said and showed Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at the rings with a serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t know the one to choose, or the one which looks pretty most everything looks pretty to her. She has never used a ring before and she doesn&#39;t fancy them so she doesn&#39;t use them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pursed her lips and looked at Bryan with an helpless expression, &#34;I don&#39;t know what to choose, How about you choose it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded, &#34;What about this?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded, &#34;It looked great,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan glanced at the attendant, &#34;We will choose this one&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant was happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ring was the most expensive ring in their store. She made a fortune today and was sure her manager would be happy and reward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; The attendant said enthusiastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan took out his card from his pocket and handed it to the attendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked out of the store together after paying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan put the ring in her finger inside the car, &#34;Use this for now, I&#39;ll help you create another one&#34; Bryan said, he also gave her the ring, she put the ring in his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shook her head, &#34;No it is fine&#34; She felt that it was unnecessary but she didn&#39;t want to hurt his feelings so she didn&#39;t tell him when he was buying the ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was about to talk when his phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took out his phone from his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was his Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked it up and put the phone in his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Grandma&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby Bryan, the doctor called me and told me you left the hospital, Why can&#39;t you stay till you recover?&#34; Grandma scolded him gently on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan pursues his lips and replied &#34;Grandma, I&#39;m fine i know my body the most&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you? Is Sherry with you?&#34; Grandma asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes she is beside me&#34; Bryan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, how about you come for lunch before going home?&#34; Grandma suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan turned around and glanced at Sherry, &#34;Grandma asked us to come for lunch, do you want to go?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded and replied, &#34;Okay&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, I&#39;ll ask Aunty Gladys to prepare lunch for you,&#34; Grandma said with an excited voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan hung up and put his phone in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt something light fall on her leg, she bent down and saw that it was paper, curious, she picked it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened it to look at the content and saw that it was the receipt for the rings that Bryan bought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped when she saw the figure he bought the rings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Bryan with her mouth open, &#34;You&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised an eyebrow when he saw her dumbfounded look, confused &#34;What?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those rings you bought are too expensive,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is worth 10 billion dollars, those small rings. It is not like she could eat the ring or something Sherry lamented in her heart. If she knew that the ring is so expensive she would have asked him not to buy it. If he is looking for ways to waste money he could give it to her and she would help him spend it well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it is fine,&#34; Bryan said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled bitterly, if she uses that money and invests in some stocks she would be able to earn 100 times of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are here,&#34; Calvin said, breaking their train of thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked out of the window and saw that they were at Grandma&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around to the other side and helped Bryan out of the car to the wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed him into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma walked towards them immediately she saw them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bryan, are you alright?&#34; She asked with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; Bryan reassured her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma nodded and glanced at Sherry, &#34;It has been hard on you&#34; She said and looked at Sherry with tenderness in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled brightly, &#34;Grandma it is my duty&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Gladys walked out of the dining room and walked towards them &#34;Young Master, are you okay?&#34; Aunty Gladys asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, don&#39;t worry about me,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is good&#34; Aunty Gladys heaved a sigh of relief when she heard his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young Madam&#34; Aunty Gladys called out respectfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled and greeted her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lunch is ready, Old Madam,&#34; Aunty Gladys told Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma clapped her hand like a child with a smile, &#34;Lunch is ready, let&#39;s go and eat&#34; She said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded and pushed Bryan towards the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She helped him to sit and sat down next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma sat down opposite them. They started eating when Grandma ate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry started eating and she was feeling so hungry and she doesn&#39;t know why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carried her glass which was filled with water and took a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt something touch her thigh, she choked on her water immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan took the towel with his left hand and wiped her mouth gently, &#34;You even choke on water&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at her thigh and saw that his right hand was caressing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, are you alright?&#34; Grandma asked with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at him and saw his innocent face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Innocent face my ass!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This shameless man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He can&#39;t keep his hand to himself and is harassing her under the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced out a smile and glanced at Grandma, &#34;I&#39;m fine, Grandma&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma nodded and continued eating oblivious of what the both of them were doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry glared at Bryan and mouthed for him to remove his hand from her thigh but he just smiled at her in a relaxed manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somebody help, He is bullying an innocent girl like her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to ignore him and continue eating her meal, but he went far and started rubbing her thigh deeper towards her pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it!&#34; Sherry said before she could stop herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma and Aunty Gladys glanced at her, confused, &#34;Are you alright?&#34; Grandma asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Aunty Gladys also asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry glanced at Bryan who was also looking at with an innocent face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt like cursing when she saw that he was still acting innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, &#34;I&#39;m fine, Grandma, i just want to use the washroom&#34; she said and stood up from her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the dining room in a hurried step and walked into the washroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at her reflection in the mirror, her face was so red like she had a fever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rinsed her face with some water so the redness on her face will show less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making sure she was back to normal she walked out of the washroom, she walked into the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma and Bryan had finished eating when she came back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright now?&#34; Grandma asked with a meaningful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed and avoided Grandma&#39;s meaningful glances and nodded, &#34;I&#39;m fine now, Grandma&#34; Sherry said in a thin voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will be leaving now,&#34; Bryan told Grandma.</p>
