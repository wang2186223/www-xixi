                <p>She slowly walked towards it as she looked around the man Calvin gave her bag to follow her behind. The garden&#39;s spacious front yard wasn&#39;t that colorful; it was quite a simple design that looked like it was purposely made that way not to attract people&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked closer to the entrance, Sherry felt that the house wasn&#39;t as simple as it looked outside. Now that she was closer, she noticed the exquisite white marble steps to the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and was a little curious about how the house would look like</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inserted  the key in her hand to unlock the door, she took the bag from the man, she took a quick glance to where the car was parked, the car was not there anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He already left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the house, the white marble floor beneath her feet seemed to stretch out for miles and the enormous beautiful chandelier that welcomed her elegantly from the high ceiling. The hallway had large and beautiful molded panels which looked very expensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was utterly impressed with the way his house is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like she was in heaven!.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She feels like she could live here forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down on the couch in the living room. She ordered take out online because when she walked into the kitchen, there was no food in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down on the couch waiting for him because she didn&#39;t know which room she would be living in and besides this is not a house and it was not like they were legally married in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just a contract marriage which would end in three months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked the time and realized that it was 9.pm and he is not back from work yet so she lay down on the couch she didn&#39;t even know when she fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>12 o&#39;clock Seductive club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was holding a bottle of wine as he was seated next to two women on the sofa. Richard was a tall man with his black jacket slightly open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was seated across from him on a wide sofa. Except for the small amount of light that shone on Bryan&#39;s magnificent face and made the women in the bar drool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How appealing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You signed the agreement with her yesterday?,&#34; Richard enquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan and Richard have been pals since childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan answered nonchalantly, &#34;Yes, I had an important meeting going on, so Secretary Clinton went on my behalf,&#34; and he took a sip from his cocktail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is a very cold person, but she is professional. I guarantee she won&#39;t feel anything for you&#34;. Richard laughed, self-deprecatingly, &#34;You should watch your own feelings. I&#39;m afraid you will be the one to fall for her instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The way you also did? And ultimately, she didn&#39;t reciprocate your feelings &#34;Bryan crossed his legs and scoffed at Richard when he heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard gave him an angry stare while gritting his teeth. &#34;You..., , I hope you&#39;ll fall for her too and witness her sign a new contract with another man. However, she is a good alternative, and my mother believed me when I introduced her to her as my girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the one who recommended Sherry to Bryan when Bryan asked him to do so after Richard and Sherry signed a month-to-month contract marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan responded, &#34;I understand,&#34; and then he stepped outside after taking a long breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re departing?&#34; Richard enquired. Bryan didn&#39;t respond or even turn to look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went outside to his car and headed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within an hour, he arrived at his home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He entered after unlocking the door with his fingerprint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned on the light and saw a lonely figure lying down on the couch. He was a little shocked when he saw this before he remembered that he is not living alone anymore, he has a partner now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His telephone suddenly rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached into his pocket and pulled his phone out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was his Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said cooly, his voice was neither loud nor low &#34;Hello, Grandma&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heard his Grandma voice no one the phone &#34;Little Bryan, are you still working?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replied with his eyes glued on the girl lying down on the couch &#34;No, I just returned home&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heard his Grandma ask &#34;When will you bring my future granddaughter-in-law to visit me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan sighed and replied &#34;When I&#39;m less busy, I&#39;ll bring her to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay Bryan, baby&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Grandma I hope you have a good night and remember to take your medication before bed or I won&#39;t bring her to visit you.&#34; He warned her with a stern voice so she would understand that he was not joking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night, okay. I will be obedient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right,&#34; he said as he awaited his grandmother to end the call first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a sigh and combed his hair with his hand.</p>
