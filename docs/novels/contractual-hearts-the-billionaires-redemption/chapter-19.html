                <p>She went home after eating dinner outside, when she got home no one was at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into her room and sat down on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, she felt a wave of pains in her stomach, turning pale and she felt something was flowing down her legs. Sherry Hue immediately knew what was going on. It was her period, her period has always been irregular.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt so muchSherry covered her stomach and lay down in the same position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her period cramps weren&#39;t anything new to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is always so painful that she would faint a lot of times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lips to keep herself from yelling, She clenched her fist tightly as the wave of pain&#39;s assault her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if someone entered the room, they won&#39;t suspect that something is wrong with her, you can only notice her odd behavior because of the beads of sweat in her forehead, her pale face and the way she clenched her fist tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already used to the pain, besides she hated anything medicine or injection, even drip. She hated it, so whenever she is sick or feeling pain she always keeps it to herself and she is already used to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, her period cramps weren&#39;t as painful as this when she first got it. It was all her foolishness that caused it, she got her period when she was in high school, she got it late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she has some friends and they discuss things like period etc, when almost all her friends have gotten their period. She hadn&#39;t seen it, she was a little anxious but she had no one to tell because her mother always travels. She felt envious of her friends a lot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally got her period, she was seventeen years old, whenever her friends are in their period, they always complain about having cramps, but she doesn&#39;t have cramps in fact her period was not painful at allbut she was not satisfied and also wanted to feel the period cramps herself, so she ate a lot of cold things and anything sweet so she could also feel it which she later felt it.. But she regrets it now..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was painful that sometimes she wished she was dead, the first day is always painful but the second day is not that painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;M-mm..&#34; Sherry moaned in pain, there were no tears in her eyes but there were a bid of sweats on her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain relieved her a little,  Sherry let out a sigh of relief. She tried to stand up , however she suddenly blacked out and fell back on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she woke up, her cramps had relieved her a lot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got up from the bed and checked the time, it was 7 o&#39;clock pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She showered and washed her body, she felt a little better after showering. She changed her clothes and walked out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a taxi to a pharmacy and bought some pads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the pharmacy after paying the cashier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to hail a taxi when she heard someone call her name from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked back to see who called her, she was a little surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jackson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called out a bit of surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her ex boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was wearing casual clothes, with a brilliant smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve become so pretty, it has been a while,&#34; Jackson said with a smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yh&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was her first love and the first boyfriend she ever had in high school but he cheated on her with another girl, she didn&#39;t know that he had been dating that girl for a long period of time before they started dating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caught them one day and finally knew the truth, she broke up with him but they were still talking as friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt her a lot but she pretended like she was not affected and hid all her pains instead, even till now it still hurt her but not as much as before .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about we grab some tea?&#34; Jackson suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked into a cafe, after sitting down Jackson called the waiter to order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remembered that you loved tea back then,&#34; Jackson suddenly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled, &#34;I don&#39;t like tea anymore, i like coffee now&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was true that she liked tea and she still liked it but she preferred coffee, the bitter taste reminded her that she should trust no one but herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jackson smiled awkwardly when he heard this, &#34;Your taste changed&#34; he turned and looked at the waiter, and ordered for coffees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have a boyfriend now?&#34; Jackson asked, he leaned back on the chair in a leisurely manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34; Sherry said, she felt a little uncomfortable because of her period.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already moved on&#34; Jackson gave a bitter smile. He was about to continue talking when his phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And by the way before you go</p>

                <p>I love you so</p>
                
                
                
                <p>if it&#39;s goodbye maybe for good</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I will not cry</p>

                <p>Oh how this year has slipped away</p>

                <p>more than words can say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know you can&#39;t stay</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I love you anyway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Baby I love you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I love you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I love you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I love you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I love you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I love you babe</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got to say</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway, I love you baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ringtone was the song she composed for him on his birthday when they were dating, listening to the song now she felt life was ironic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up his phone and talked with the person briefly before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about that&#34; He gave an apologetic smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is fine,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter came back with their orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry took one of the coffee and drank it quickly to force the bitterness on her throat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t move on Sherry, I think I&#39;m still in love with you,&#34; Jackson confessed with a bitter smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jackson, everything already ended and it can&#39;t continue again. Besides I have a boyfriend I love now, we can only be friends,&#34; Sherry replied and took a sip of her coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jackson was about to talk when his phone rang once more. He picked it up and talked on the phone briefly before he hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, sorry I have to leave now I have something important to attend to it&#34; Jackson said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bent down and moved towards her, Sherry shrank back when she saw him bringing his face towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a peck?&#34; Jackson asked when he saw her shrank back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; Sherry rejected him coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, let&#39;s meet later,&#34; Jackson said and hurriedly left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sighed and continued drinking her coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she suddenly saw something in the seat Jackson sat.</p>
