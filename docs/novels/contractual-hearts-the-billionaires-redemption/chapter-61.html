                <p>She must be planning something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at her body and saw that the clothes she was wearing was different from the one she wore today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are my clothes?&#34; She raised her head and looked at him in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan replied, &#34;I have washed them&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was stunned, &#34;Yo-u washthem?&#34; She stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded and looked like it was not a big deal, but it was a big deal for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one has ever washed her clothes before, she was also sure that the clothes will be stained red because of her monthly visitor but he actually washed them without feeling repulsed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she herself always feels repulsed whenever her clothes are stained, she would rather throw them away than wash them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reason why she fell for Jackson in high school was because the first time her period came, she didn&#39;t know that she was having her period.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the first time she ever had it so she didn&#39;t notice anything amiss. She went to Wendy&#39;s class to ask her for something and she was sure Wendy saw that her skirt was stained but she didn&#39;t tell her. It was Jackson who told her and removed his hoodie, he wrapped it around her waist. She was shocked when he didn&#39;t care whether his hoodie would also stain with blood but she was elated and admired him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the cool, gentle and handsome man in her mind then. When she confronted Wendy about it, she admitted that she saw it but she thought Sherry knew about it and maybe she wanted to go and change it. Her explanation was flawless, it is okay to be ignorant or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked her eyes rapidly to prevent her tears from falling. After regaining her control she looked at him like it was not a big deal too since he didn&#39;t see it as a big deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you&#34; She whispered in a low tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded and stood up, he walked towards her, &#34;Time to go home&#34; He announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I have not used the tampon yet,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would feel uncomfortable if she didn&#39;t use a tampon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has been changed already,&#34; Bryan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the nurse&#34; Sherry asked casually, not really expecting an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I changed it,&#34; Bryan replied with a nonchalant expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was stunned, she froze and looked at him in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought it was the nurse who changed it, so she was just asking casually and she was not expecting his answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You changed them?&#34; Sherry asked with a shocked expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, why?&#34; Bryan raised an eyebrow at her shocked expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you even know how to do it?&#34; Sherry shrieked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I googled about it&#34; Bryan said and carried her in his arms, &#34;Time to go home, Wifey&#34; he said in a deep voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t struggle because she was still in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even know when they walked out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried her and put her down in the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She regained herself after he closed the passenger door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why she was feeling comfortable but she didn&#39;t relate it to her tampon being changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems the medicine she took earlier worked, because her cramps were getting better even though it still hurts but it is still better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you feeling hungry?&#34; Bryan asked, immediately he sat down by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was about to talk when her stomach growled in reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even realize that she was hungry, if he didn&#39;t ask, so many things happened that it made her forget her hunger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want to eat?&#34; Bryan asked with a doting smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hotpot!&#34; Sherry replied, it has been a while since she ate that last, she has always been dreaming about it, sometimes she always imagined herself eating it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry licked her lips in anticipation, thinking about the hotspot alone, making her drool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not a big fan hotpot but he still decided to fulfill her wish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was feeling amused at her drooling face, he started the car and drove out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan parked the car at the nearest hotpot restaurant he saw. She got down from the car without waiting for him to tell her. Bryan shook his head at her excitement, he held her hand and they walked into the restaurant together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A waiter approached them instantly, &#34;Welcome sir and Madam, would you like to eat at the lobby or a room?&#34; The waiter asked politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it was a hotpot place, the price was rather high and the temperature was cozy and warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at her, with an eyebrow raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything she says goes, if it is a room she wants he would accept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No we will eat at the lobby, Please a quiet place&#34; Sherry smiled at the waiter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter blushed when he saw her smile, he nodded bashfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lobby will be cheaper and they will spend less than the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter took them to a table next to the window, it was in the corner but it had a great view but most importantly it was quiet and good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, this is the best place and the most quiet place in the lobby. It has a great view. I hope you like it. Ring the bell anytime you need help&#34; The waiter smiled, his eyes were only on Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at the waiter, he felt jealous when he saw that the waiter was paying her extra attention. He glared at the waiter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. He looked at the man behind the beautiful lady and knew that chill was emitting from him. He was scared and lowered his head before fleeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t notice anything amiss, Bryan shook his head lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even know what her charms were doing to other people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly felt like he should be following her everywhere, she is still so naive and doesn&#39;t even know when a guy likes her or hits on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They soon finished ordering, and Naive Sherry started eating her delicious hotpot without a care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She savored the taste in her mouth, she would moan in satisfaction with every spoon she takes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It still tastes so delicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loved eating a lot, but she stopped eating after sometime. She doesn&#39;t know why she stopped eating it even though she liked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan felt sullen when he realized that all her attention was on the hotpot, she didn&#39;t even give him a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew it sounded ridiculous but he felt jealous of the hotpot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry raised her head and looked at Bryan, she suddenly realized that he was not eating, &#34;You are not eating? Or you don&#39;t like it?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>66</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan felt sullen when he heard her question,  he arched an eyebrow, &#34;You just realized it?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s mouth twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why does it sound like she doesn&#39;t care about him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brought a spoon of hotpot towards his mouth, &#34;Taste it&#34; She said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan opened his mouth happily and ate it even though he didn&#39;t like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delicious right?&#34; Sherry asked him with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dig in then. Eat more&#34; Sherry said and continued eating her food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They finished eating the hotpot and walked out of the restaurant, Sherry felt her stomach was bloated. Her stomach was full of hotpot and she liked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you full?&#34; Bryan asked and drove out of the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pouted when she heard his question, but she nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got home in an hour and thirty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry walked into the room, her body was sticky. She wants to quickly take a shower and wear other clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the bathroom and showered, she walked out of the bathroom with a towel that didn&#39;t reach her knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised his head and looked at her immediately he heard the bathroom door open. He felt his throat dry and his eyes became darker, a certain place was aroused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t notice his reaction and walked to her closet to change her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put on her pajamas and walked towards the bed. She lay down on the bed, and glanced at Bryan with her eyebrow raised, &#34;You don&#39;t want to take a shower?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan bit his lips when he heard her question. If not because she was in her period and couldn&#39;t do anything, he would have misunderstood that as an invitation..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry noticed his odd behavior and knew that he was feeling aroused, so she decided to tease him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her clothes slowly, &#34;Why am I feeling so hot?&#34; She asked not to ask him, just saying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fanned herself and lifted her clothes slowly, his eyes followed her movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly stopped and yawned, &#34;I&#39;m suddenly not feeling hot anymore,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan realized immediately that he was tricked, he felt amused and angry too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, just because you are on your period doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t use your hand&#34; Bryan threatened her with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry faked a yawn. Immediately she heard his words, &#34;I&#39;m feeling sleepy, so I won&#39;t disturb you anymore.&#34; She covered her whole body with a blanket like she was afraid that Bryan would change his mind and asked her to use her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan sighed and walked into the bathroom. He took a shower and calmed his excited crotch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked out of the room and glanced at Sherry. Her breathing was now even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry fell asleep without knowing, she felt her cramps worsen in the middle of the night but she was feeling sleepy and didn&#39;t want to open her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt something warm attached to her stomach, easing her pain. She was confused and wanted to open her eyes but her eyes were heavy but it made her sleep soundly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she woke up the next day it was 8.30 am. Seeing the time Sherry jumped out of the bed and ran into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a class today and the professor was a strict person, and he would mark the attendance. If he finds out that she skipped school, she is finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry quickly took a shower, her cramps were much better than yesterday, she walked out of the bathroom after she finished taking a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly changing into a new outfit, She walked out of the room, she saw some foods covered in the dining table, she already knew that it was Bryan who cooked but she was already late for the class and didn&#39;t have time to eat but remembering how sweet his food tastes. She couldn&#39;t resist the temptation and walked towards the dining room. She opened it and saw that it was her best food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw a paper beside it as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Take your time to eat, i already called your school that you are sick, Your perfect hubby&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt her heart warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Muack, perfect hubby&#34; Sherry kissed the letter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down to eat, she ate slowly to savor the taste of the food since he had solved the professor&#39;s end.</p>

                <p>Her phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took it out from her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Tara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked it up and put the phone on her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello baby girl, are you already missing me?&#34; Sherry asked with a cheeky smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope! I don&#39;t&#34; Tara replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep on lying to yourself&#34; Sherry snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry,&#34; Tara said in a grave voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stopped eating and her expression turned serious when she heard how grave her voice sounded. What is it? Did something happen?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara on the other hand bit her lips, &#34;I think I&#39;m pregnant&#34; She said in a mosquito voice but it was loud enough for Sherry to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? How did you know?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My period for this month is late,&#34; Tara said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you should confirm first before you think it might not be what you think besides what will you do if you are really pregnant? Will you keep it?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure but it is a life, I can&#39;t kill my baby. Besides, my mom has been bugging about her grandchildren so it will be fine&#34; Tara said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, any decision you want to take I&#39;ll support you but don&#39;t be harsh to yourself&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m feeling a little happy tho, i feel like marriage is a bondage and i don&#39;t want to get married before i just want to get pregnant&#34; Tara said and laughed, &#34;I know this sounds ridiculous but i feel happy that I&#39;m pregnant without knowing his father&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry bit her lip, &#34;It doesn&#39;t sound ridiculous to me because I have the same mentality as you. I feel like marriage is a bondage too but after marriage there is still divorce, no? So marriage is not a big deal because we don&#39;t feel the same, we will divorce anyway&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt jealous of Tara. She has a baby after a one night stand. That was what she wanted too. She wanted her own baby too without getting married before she met Bryan even after she met Bryan but she never imagined that she would fall for him and agree to marry him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is right</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has fallen in love with Bryan but she didn&#39;t tell him. She is scared because she still doesn&#39;t know the feelings he has for her. What if he doesn&#39;t feel the same for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are really telepathic then&#34; Tara said with a smile then her voice turned serious, &#34;Uhm.. Sherry, have you seen the headline?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was confused, she doesn&#39;t read news or check the entertainment gossip. She has a business mentality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money first after money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second thing on her mind was money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact everything on her mind is money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t check the news or gossip, why?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm.. It is better if you check it&#34; Tara said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded, &#34;Okay&#34; She said and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned on her mobile data connection, notification keep popping. She went to Instagram immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first headline she saw shocked her to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze and stared at her phone in horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>67</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocking headlines bombard the social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The headline was: &#34;After getting marry rich, she forgot her parents&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry clicked on the first article and started reading the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sneered once she finished reading it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news was about how she got married to Bryan and forgot her father, she didn&#39;t take care of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He is back!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the first that came into Sherry&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t know that her father is so shameless, he left them without turning back when they were young. Now he is saying nonsense about her not taking care of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was confused about how he knew that she got married to Bryan then she remembered that Bryan publicly introduced her as his wife, so he saw the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scrolled to the comment section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Unfilial daughter indeed, she forgot her parents after getting married rich, may God not let us give birth to a daughter like her&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;ll die if I lie:  First commenter, Amen to that. The man is really suffering he said he called her number but she blocked him after picking his call once, she also asked him not to call her anymore&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Shit: I&#39;ll die if I lie, really, she really said that?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ll die if I lie: Of course! The reporter is my friend, the poor man has to report her to my friend so everyone could know what she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Red: I really admired her before but I don&#39;t like her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry is a whore: You like that whore? You don&#39;t have a good taste. She is a whore who seduces married men or any second generation rich heir</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Youth: Really, Mr Tony married someone like that? It seems she really hid her characters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Badbitch: She is a whore, she seduces someone else&#39;s fiance and marries him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry whore: i could already guess it, I heard that Miss Flow Cunningham was engaged with Mr Tony before, but Mr Tony suddenly announced her as his wife, it seems this woman is really skillful</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slut: How much does a night cost @Sherry</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuxk: You want to sleep with her? Haha</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow is the best: Justice for Flow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Justice for Flow 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Justice for Flow 3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry laughed in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exited from Instagram.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone rang at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Tara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry picked it up and put the phone on her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, uhm have you seen it? Are you alright?&#34; Tara asked consciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry chuckled, &#34;I&#39;m fine, do you think something like this will affect me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara heaved a sigh of relief when she heard this, &#34;You won&#39;t clarify it?&#34; Tara asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope, it will die down later there is no need to. You are not sure of what happened but you still believe me?&#34; Sherry arched an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I believe you and I&#39;ll support any decision you want to take but the comments are really annoying,&#34; Tara said in an irritated voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t look at it anymore if they are annoying,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, I won&#39;t so I won&#39;t spill blood in anger&#34; Tara said in a sarcastic voice and continued &#34;But are you coming to school today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure why not,&#34; Sherry shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the reporters will be harassing you,&#34; Tara said worriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is fine,&#34; Sherry replied and carried her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay see you in school then&#34; Tara said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Sherry replied and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the house, her phone suddenly rang again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring! Ring!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She guessed he already saw the news, The news was so big that no one would miss it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was confused on why her mom had not called her yet but she guessed that she had not seen the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry picked it up and put the phone on her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw the news&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t know what to say, she was nervous that he would believe the news but will not believe her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if he asked for a divorce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would sign it, even if her heart would hurt she would sign it because of her pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She will never beg a man to stay anymore, so she will sign it even if it will hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you listening?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry snapped out of her thoughts and asked, &#34;en?&#34; She didn&#39;t hear anything he said because her mind had wandered around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked you to stay home for now, the reporters are at the gate. The security just called me. I have taken the news down so you should rest at home. I&#39;ll ask for some leave in your school too&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded but she realized that he couldn&#39;t see so she cleared her throat, &#34;Uhm.. Thank you. Uhm.. You don&#39;t have anything to ask me?&#34; Sherry hesitated before asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or has he already concluded and deemed her guilty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I believe you, I&#39;ll wait till you are ready to tell me also,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tears she was holding fell. She couldn&#39;t help it, she thought he would divorce her since the news will affect his company. A business man will always choose his company over an unknown woman, no?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he broadened her zone, she couldn&#39;t believe that he would still help even though it will affect his company, she was already ready for the worst which would be divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry? Are you hearing me? Are you alright&#34; Bryan&#39;s anxious voice was heard on the phone, he didn&#39;t hear her voice anymore and thought something happened to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was about to reply him when she heard his Secretary&#39;s voice, &#34;Boss, you can&#39;t leave, you have an important meeting in five minutes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry saw that she made him worried by not talking so she quickly replied to him, &#34;Uhm I&#39;m fine, &#34;she said in a hoarse voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her voice Bryan could tell that she was crying, his heart aches for her, &#34;You are crying, Why are you crying? Are you a baby?&#34; Bryan said in order to amuse her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled, &#34;Thank you for believing me&#34; She said sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are my wife, so i have to believe you and side you not the outsiders&#34; Bryan said and added, &#34;If you really want to thank me, finish your monthly flow quickly and thank me by letting me ravish you non stop&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was about to thank him once again but she blushed when she heard the last part, &#34;Hmph, i don&#39;t want to thank you anymore&#34; She said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ungrateful, I&#39;ll punish you when you are free&#34; he said in a deep and seductive voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed, her body reacted strangely to his voice, &#34;I won&#39;t talk to you anymore&#34; Sherry said and hung up immediately before he corrupted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t go to school now even if she wanted to, so she walked back into their bedroom and lay down on the bed with her laptop. She checked the news and saw that most of them had been taken down as he said. She sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She logged into her stock app to check Bryan&#39;s company shares. It was very low as she expected because of the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she doesn&#39;t want to clarify it, she still feels the need to clarify it so it would stop affecting his company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She logged into her social media app and started typing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone suddenly rang when she was about to post it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>68</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t go to school now even if she wanted to, so she walked back into their bedroom and lay down on the bed with her laptop. She checked the news and saw that most of them had been taken down as he said. She sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She logged into her stock app to check Bryan&#39;s company shares. It was very low as she expected because of the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she doesn&#39;t want to clarify it, she still feels the need to clarify it so it would stop affecting his company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She logged into her social media app and started typing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone suddenly rang when she was about to post it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arched an eyebrow when she saw who the caller was. She would have forgotten about her existence if she didn&#39;t call her today. It has been awhile since she saw her last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is not that she wants to see her but she knew that she liked Bryan and would not give up easily but was surprised when she didn&#39;t disturb them anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked the phone and put it on her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, who is this?&#34; Sherry asked, pretending not to know that she is the one calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow smug smile froze, She gritted her teeth and gripped her phone tightly, she took a deep breath and said &#34;I&#39;m the one Miss Sherry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry exclaimed, &#34;Oh! Miss Flow! Sorry I don&#39;t save a number of people I&#39;m not familiar with but I&#39;ll save yours now&#34; She said with a cheeky smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow gripped her phone tightly and squeezed it, &#34;Oh! I don&#39;t mind, I saw the news about you online, but i believe you and i have clarified that there is nothing between big brother Bryan and i too&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you don&#39;t have to help me so much,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not helping you, I&#39;m helping Brother Bryan,&#34; Flow said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I&#39;ll have to thank you on my husband&#39;s behalf then,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hung up immediately without waiting for her reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow heard the beeping sounds which was reminding her that Sherry hung up on her. She smashed her phone on the floor angrily, &#34;Bitch!&#34; She cursed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took her phone from the floor and removed the sim card, she opened her drawer and brought out another phone, she inserted her sim card into the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The number rang before the person picked up in the third ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello&#34; Flow said still feeling angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who made our princess angry?&#34; The person on the other side asked, it was a male voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who else except that bitch? Bryan has removed the article about that bitch&#39;s news, Can you put it back?&#34; Flow asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man chuckled wickedly, &#34;You don&#39;t have to, everyone would have seen the news by now&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow disagreed, &#34;No, I want her news to be still there for at least three or five days. Can you do that?&#34; Flow asked impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You also know how powerful Tony is, do you want me to die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do that?&#34; Flow asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, i want to make sure Brother Bryan would have no choice but to divorce, Ruin her reputation for me&#34; Flow said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow finally smiled in satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph watch how brother Bryan would divorce you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t believe he won&#39;t divorce you with your reputation down the hill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She logged into her social media and went to Flow&#39;s account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw her post and started reading it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Hi everyone, i saw the rumors about me and big brother Bryan, actually i wouldn&#39;t deny that i like Brother Bryan and i still liked him but i already gave up and gave them my blessing when he married sister-in-law, @Sherryhue so please refrain from spreading rumors. And about my sister-in-law scandal, although i don&#39;t know what happened i believe her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sneered once she finished reading her post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made it look like she was really the third party and she would gain people&#39;s sympathy and admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attention seeker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry scrolled down to read the comment section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she expected people were bashing her and was consoling Flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow&#39; hubby: I know that it was bitch who seduced Mr Tony. You are really nice and kindhearted you even forgive her and call her sister-in-law, That bitch seduce married men</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitchy: Tsk tsk you are really nice you gave up easily i love your courage, thumbs up you are my role model from now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow daddy: She is not only taking care of her parents, she even seduced people&#39;s men, watch out for this whore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anonymous: You are so kindhearted, you should not be like that black hearted bitch, keep being kindhearted&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry laughed, feeling amused when she saw people&#39;s comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kind Hearted? Indeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she doesn&#39;t have any evidence that she has something to do with her kidnapping, she had a feeling that she was behind it but no evidence to prove that. And her feelings are always accurate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It has never happened to her before, it was when she met Bryan that she was first kidnapped so she had all right to suspect Flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exited her social media and turned off her data.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wants to clarify the news before because of Bryan so it would stop affecting him but she knew that just making a post about it would only worsen the situation because no one would believe her without evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t have a father and her father is dead already, and she is taking care of her mommy without hesitation, what right does he have that made him think that she should take care of him?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She can give him a huge sum of money though, that will be for donating sperm, and everything he paid for when she was young. She would repay him for that but after that sum of money, she would have nothing to do with him anymore, it seems his mistress ran away after he ran out of money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry glanced at her phone and saw that there was no call from her mom nor Nancy. She was confused but she couldn&#39;t go out of the house because of the reporters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dialed her mom&#39;s number after a moment of hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom picked up when the phone was about to hang up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Sherry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, where are you?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m at home, have you forgiven me for what happened the other day?&#34; Her mom asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the day when she went to her mom&#39;s house, when her mom told her that Wendy told her that she seduced a married man but her mom chose to believe Wendy but didn&#39;t believe and she left her house in anger and it was the same day she was kidnapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry bit her lower lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has not forgiven her but she hummed and replied positively, &#34;Yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom sighed, &#34;That is good, why did you call?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry hesitated before asking &#34;Uhm.. Did anyone call You?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, why?&#34; Her mom replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sighed in relief once she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It means her mom was still in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing just asking, I&#39;m busy I&#39;ll call you later&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed and put her phone beside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped her mom wouldn&#39;t notice anything amissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>69</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the day when she went to her mom&#39;s house, when her mom told her that Wendy told her that she seduced a married man but her mom chose to believe Wendy but didn&#39;t believe and she left her house in anger and it was the same day she was kidnapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry bit her lower lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has not forgiven her but she hummed and replied positively, &#34;Yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom sighed, &#34;That is good, why did you call?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry hesitated before asking &#34;Uhm.. Did anyone call You?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, why?&#34; Her mom replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sighed in relief once she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It means her mom was still in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing just asking, I&#39;m busy I&#39;ll call you later&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed and put her phone beside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped her mom wouldn&#39;t notice anything .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lay down feeling bored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took it and glanced at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Nancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked it up and put the phone on her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, can you come down to the police station?&#34; Nancy said, her voice sounded hoarse and weak like she had been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sat down on the bed straight when she heard her voice, &#34;What are you doing there? Are you owing someone again?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy burst into tears when she heard her question, &#34;Lil sis, I&#39;m really sorry. I promise not to do it anymore but can you come and get me? This place looks scary&#34; Nancy pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sighed, her heart softened, she was her blood sister after all. Sherry has vowed that she won&#39;t help her pay anymore debts but her heart softened this time. They suffered together when they were young so she couldn&#39;t abandon her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; A man&#39;s voice said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry knitted her brow when she heard a stranger voice, &#34;Who are you?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the officer handling Miss Nancy&#39;s case, are you her sister?&#34; The officer asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry replied, &#34;Yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, your sister borrowed the sum of a million dollars from a lady for the past two months, she has refused to pay so can you come to our station?&#34; The officer asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is your office located?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Downhills Local Area&#34; The officer replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry said &#39;okay&#39; and hung up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took her phone and walked out of the house in a hurried step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t see David, her personal driver when she got to the carpark. She didn&#39;t want to waste anymore time and walked out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was living in an estate so a taxi couldn&#39;t come into the estate, she would have to walk out of the estate before she would be able to see a taxi, fortunately Bryan&#39;s house was not far from the estate gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got to the gate in ten minutes, immediately she walked out of the gate, and the crowd surrounded her immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was surprised, she looked around and saw that they were reporters, she then remembered the scandal about her. She had forgotten all about it because of her sister&#39;s call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters put their camera in front of her taking numerous pictures of her, &#34;Mrs Tony, is it true you abandoned your father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stopped taking care of your father after getting married rich, did you feel guilty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs Tony please clarify this&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs Tony, is it true that you like seducing married men even though you are married?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs Tony, is it true that you seduced Mr Tony before he finally married you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Dammit!&#39; Sherry cursed in a low tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was almost blinded by the nonstop flash, feeling dizzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to walk away from the crowd but they didn&#39;t give way and blocked her from leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly someone threw something from the crowd, it met her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry touched it and smelled it, it was an egg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs Tony, why are you trying to leave? Are you admitting all the allegations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs Tony, what do you have to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was getting irritated and anxious, she growled impatiently, &#34;Get out of my way&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone suddenly rushed out from the crowd, the middle aged woman was dressed in expensive clothes, she grabbed Sherry by her hair, the attack came so sudden that Sherry was caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t dodge in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You f**king whore, after getting married to a rich tycoon, you are not satisfied and seduced my husband too&#34; The woman&#39;s voice was very loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters started videoing everything immediately, everyone watched the woman and didn&#39;t try to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See, she seduced this woman husband too&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So she is such a whore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is right, she is not satisfied after getting married to a tycoon&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tsk tsk a whore will always be a whore&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s hair grabbed, she felt a great pain. She tried to remove the woman&#39;s hand from her hair but the woman was too strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing? I don&#39;t know you or your husband&#34; Sherry told the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stupid bitch, how will you know me? You slept with my husband&#34; The woman yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry hair prickled, she was starting to feel her headache, she pinched the woman&#39;s hand that grabbed her hand. The woman released her hair when she felt the pain in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry tried to run away from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, someone poured water on her body. It seems the person was prepared so the urine met her body accurately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It smells so bad, her body was all wet and dripping with urine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bitch, you want to run away? I&#39;ll discipline you&#34; The woman walked towards her, when she realized that Sherry was about to run away, fortunately someone helped her by pouring a bucket of urine in her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she said that, the woman shoved her and then got over her, slapping her hard on the face. Her hand and leg were pulled securely, she couldn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s face was burning after being slapped, although she was humiliated when she was in high school. She was never humiliated like this, it felt like she had gone back to the times in her high school. She was thrown different things on her body but she was never slapped. The people around her were laughing like when she was in high school, it felt like she had gone back to then, when they made her life difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the phone started to ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman who took her down could hear the ringtone, so she removed the phone from her pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the screen and saw &#39;Baby&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are really shameless, is it one of the men you seduced that is calling you, let&#39;s see who else you seduced after seducing my husband&#34; The woman scorned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s mind was blank, she didn&#39;t even know that her phone was ringing or what the woman said, her mind was empty and she was feeling dizzy. She was feeling conscious and unconscious at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman picked up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Wifey&#34; a deep voice was heard on the phone, it sounds mature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman was pissed off when she heard the man&#39;s voice, &#34;Do you know that she is a whore who seduced men? I guess you are one of those men this bitch seduced&#34; The woman said on the phone and slapped Sherry after saying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was loud and clear, the man on the other side of the phone could hear it clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>70</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman picked up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Wifey&#34; a deep voice was heard on the phone, it sounds mature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman was pissed off when she heard the man&#39;s voice, &#34;Do you know that she is a whore who seduced men? I guess you are one of those men this bitch seduced&#34; The woman said on the phone and slapped Sherry after saying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was loud and clear, the man on the other side of the phone could hear it clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was sitting down in his office with a leisurely smile on his face, he decided to call Sherry and asked her to come to his office because she would be feeling bored at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up his phone and dialed her number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone rang and she picked at the third ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Wifey,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know that she is a whore who seduces men? I guess you are one of those men this bitch seduced&#34; A woman said on the phone and he heard her hit someone after saying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up and walked out of the company in a hurried step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked to where his car was parked, fortunately, Calvin was there. He opened the door and got into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go home,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin started the car and drove out of the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drive fast&#34; Bryan said, he felt that the pace he was driving was too slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin drove faster when he heard his urgent voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t move or groan in pain after getting another slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already falling unconscious. She was feeling a lot of pain, she didn&#39;t struggle and just let the woman do whatever she wants</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is tired, mentally, physically and emotionally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone suddenly exclaimed in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s face turned pale in fear once she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just asked to beat her till her face was destroyed but she should not kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up from Sherry&#39;s body. She has been sitting down on her body since.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman kicked her, &#34;I think the bitch is just pretending.&#34; The woman said she was fearless, but she was actually trembling inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin parked the car at the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; Bryan askes impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The gate is blocked, there are reporters and there is no way to pass,&#34; Calvin said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at the crowd, he was about to turn his head away when he saw a familiar clothes lying down on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart felt like it stopped beating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the car door and walked out of the car, he walked towards the crowd, his heart was beating fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hoping that he saw it wrongly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart ached when he saw that she was truly the one. She looked unrecognizable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman quickly released Sherry Bryan&#39;s sharp gaze fell on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shivered in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at Sherry but she was not moving, she looked like she was dead except the way her chest was beating in a slow pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked closer to her and carried her in his arms not caring about how dirty and haggard she looked. The smell of urine assaulted his nose, but he didn&#39;t care about that, he was a clean freak but he didn&#39;t even bother about getting dirty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry?&#34; He whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry heard the familiar voice, she tried to open her heavy eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hubby, you are finally here&#34; She said in a low tone, her voice sounded coarse, she forced out a smile, the smile was worse than tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart felt like it was squeezed in pain, she looked pitiful. He regretted not arriving fast to protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm, I&#39;m here&#34; Bryan smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan turned towards the woman, burning in rage and murderous intent, he didn&#39;t even care that the reporters were here. He turned and glanced at Calvin who followed him, &#34;Call the police, arrest everyone of them, sue them&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin immediately followed his order and called the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Done Boss&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin said with sweat dripping from his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pitied these people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They dared to offend the Boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pitied Young Madam the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked unrecognizable and haggard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters shivered in fear once they heard that he asked Calvin to call the police. They wanted to flee but someone suddenly exclaimed from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is Mr Tony&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Mr Tony?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shivered in fear when they heard this. They wanted to flee desperately but they found out that they were surrounded by men in black, with ferocious looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shivered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were told that Mr Tony doesn&#39;t care about her, that was why they were fearless and did this. If they knew that he valued her like this, they wouldn&#39;t do it even if they were given ten lives. They started regretting it, they should have not believed what that person said. They don&#39;t even know who told them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman trembled when he heard that the police were called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Bryan and tried to feign righteousness, &#34;This woman seduced my husband first&#34; The woman said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan chuckled in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt like releasing his anger but he couldn&#39;t beat a lady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan ignored her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police soon arrived, after seeing Bryan they didn&#39;t ask for the details before they arrested everyone in the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan carried her into the car and Calvin drove straight to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They arrived at the hospital and rushed Sherry into the emergency room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor came out of the emergency room after an hour. He looked exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan walked towards him. &#34;How is she?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is fine, she just had a concussion and will be fine. She is still unconscious and will wake up soon&#34; The doctor said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked towards the ward Sherry was taken to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her clothes were now changed and her hair was washed and neat. Although the slap mark was still on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan sighed and blamed himself for arriving late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat down beside waiting for her to wake up. The doctor told him that he was not sure of when she would wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring!! Ring!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took it out from his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was one of his guards, who escorted the reporters to the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan walked out of the ward, so he wouldn&#39;t disturb her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up after walking out of the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, the woman already confessed she said someone instructed her to do so to Young Madam&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan clenched his fist tightly in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who instructed her?&#34; He asked, his voice was lace with malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard shivered in fear when he heard how cold he sounded on the phone, he knew that his Boss was angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She said she didn&#39;t see the person, She only received a call and it was a woman&#39;s voice&#34; The bodyguard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want excuses!I want to know who the mastermind is, I&#39;ll give twenty four hours to find out who is behind it,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Boss&#34; The bodyguard said without arguing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan hung up the phone and walked back to the ward, her eyes were still closed. He sighed and sat down.</p>
