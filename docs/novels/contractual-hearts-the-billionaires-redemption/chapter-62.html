                <p>Bryan hung up the phone and walked back to the ward, her eyes were still closed. He sighed and sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry groaned from her sleep, her eyes felt heavy and she felt her face burn. Bryan heard her groan and quickly stood up, looking at her with concern, &#34;You are awake? How do you feel?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry tried to stand up so she could sit down, Bryan quickly helped her sit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bryan?&#34; Sherry called, in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes baby?&#34; Bryan answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry hugged him tightly, Bryan was shocked, but he didn&#39;t pull away from her hug, instead hugged her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry tears fell when he heard his comforting voice, Bryan was flustered when he saw her start crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doesn&#39;t know how to comfort a person crying because he has never done it before, even if a girl was crying in front of him he wouldn&#39;t care not to talk about comforting the girl but his heart ached when he heard Sherry&#39;s cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He patted her back the way his grandma would do to him, whenever they hugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry is not a person who cries easily, she would rather hide her pains and tears than express it. She was shocked but she felt injustice when she saw the concern in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She released him feeling a little awkward when she saw that her tears had stained his suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt more embarrassed when she saw the teasing smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay now?&#34; Bryan asked with an arched eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded, &#34;Can we go home?&#34; She asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hates the smell of the hospital and wants to go home quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; Bryan replied</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him with a pitiful face, &#34;Please hubby&#34; She begged with her mouth pout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan&#39;s heart melted and he unconsciously nodded, Sherry was overjoyed. By the time he realized what he did, it was already too late, he decided not to say anything after seeing her happy expression, he felt amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why is she happy just because they are leaving the hospital?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hates hospitals that much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly tried to stand up from the bed in a hurry, she accidentally touched her wound and groaned in pain. Bryan quickly supported her with a concern in his eyes, &#34;are you alright?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan sighed and carried her in his arms. Sherry was caught off guard, by the time she realized what happened she was already in his arms, she struggled in his arms, &#34;I can walk&#34; She tried to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hit her on her butt, &#34;Behave&#34; He said and started stroding out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s face flushed red when he hit her butt, she decided to enjoy the special treatment from a handsome hunk then, she had nothing to lose anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin opened the backseat door immediately he saw them, Bryan carried her into the car. Calvin started the car and drove home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was carried by Bryan again when they got home, he put her on the bed. Sherry felt better after smelling the familiar smell of the room not like the hospital that smells like drugs all over it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spit spit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just thinking about it made her want to puke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly remembered something. She keeps feeling that she has neglected something. She has been trying to remember but couldn&#39;t remember no matter how much she tried when she woke up. She remembered now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sister, Nancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly picked up her phone and dialed her number but it says the phone is not available.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up from the bed even with the pains she was feeling all over her body, she walked out of the room. She took the elevator to the living room, she saw Bryan and a man she was not familiar with and was about to walk towards them, when she heard Bryan say her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So did you investigate the number who called the woman? Did you find out who the mastermind was?&#34; Bryan asked the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry immediately stopped on her foot, she doesn&#39;t mean to eavesdrop but she had a feeling that what they are talking about has something to do with the woman who attacked her today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man sighed, &#34;Yes I already found out who the person is, but you have to prepare yourself&#34; Conerlius replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is Flow Cunningham, that&#39;s her number but what is making me confused was why she would use her phone to do such thing, that will harm her if there is evidence&#34; Conerlius replied in a shock, he rubbed his arms feeling frightened when he saw how Bryan looked like he wants to murder someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt like he would die without knowing how he died with Bryan&#39;s mood swings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan&#39;s face turned cold and frightening, he raised his head and looked at Cornelius &#34;Since there is evidence, hand it over to the police let them handle it&#34; Bryan replied after thinking for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conerlius nodded, to let him know that he understands, He dip his hand into his pocket and brought out a balm. he stretched his hand towards Bryan and handed it to him saying, &#34;This is balm a friend of mine who is a doctor developed, give it to sister-in-law, she should use it for her wounds, they would go down in two days &#34; Cornelius said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan accepted the medicine without reservation, &#34;Thank you &#34; He has been thinking on how to get an effective balm, but Cornelius was considerate enough and brought it with him, he felt grateful for his thoughtfulness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conerlius was shocked when he heard him say thank you &#39; and the grateful eyes he used to look at him but he didn&#39;t show anything because he knew Bryan was not in the mood if not he would have teased him, he said a few words and left..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked when she heard that it was Flow &#39;s handed work indeed, she already guessed that she was the one but she didn&#39;t have a way to confirm her guess, but what the man said made her know that her guess was really right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her head and looked at Bryan, at the same time Bryan&#39;s eyes met hers. He looked shocked when he saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she hear everything they said?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Will she leave him because of what Flow did?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He concealed his shock and walked towards her with a smile, &#34;Why are you here? Are you not supposed to be resting at this time?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry then remembered the reason why she left her room, &#34;My sister is at the police station, I&#39;ll go and bail her&#34; Sherry smiled at him, pretending like she just arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your sister? Which Police station?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry explained to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded after listening to her explanation, he took his phone from his pocket and dialed a number, he hung up after one minute. He looked at Sherry who was looking at him eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just called the police, they said a man called Steven bailed her out four hours ago&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry heaved a sigh of relief when she heard this, fortunately, Steven helped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you&#34; She thanked him sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about you thank me with a kiss?&#34; Bryan said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed, she tiptoed and kissed him on the lips briefly, it was a short kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was shocked, he was actually just teasing her, because she has not been in a good mood since they left the hospital and this was the first time she took the initiative and kissed him, he was really happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was grinning from ear to ear and looked happy.</p>
