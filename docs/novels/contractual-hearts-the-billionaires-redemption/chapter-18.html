                <p>She walked into the class, almost all the seats were occupied, she looked around and saw a seat beside the girl who came to meet her the day before yesterday, Tara and a space beside Vera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara was waving at her immediately as she walked into the class. She doesn&#39;t want to sit beside that spoiled brat Vera, so she opt for Tara. She walked towards Tara and sat down next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara smiled widely when Sherry sat down beside, &#34;I can&#39;t believe you are sitting beside me,&#34; Tara said in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Sherry asked curiously, the class was boring anyway so she decided to talk with Tara instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard about how good your grades were, and I have been admiring you since then. To me you are like a role model&#34; Tara smiled, Sherry looked at her, she looked so innocent, and cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara didn&#39;t mind that Sherry didn&#39;t reply to her that much. She continued talking, even though Sherry didn&#39;t talk or answer that much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon the lecturer walked into the class, it was a female lecturer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled when she saw Sherry, &#34;Miss Sherry I&#39;m happy you attended my lecture this semester&#34; Glory chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded, she didn&#39;t know what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glory smiled, not feeling embarrassed when she saw this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay guys we stopped at types of flowers, who can name ten types of flowers?&#34; Glory started the lecture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke after she asked this question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vera was about to stand up arrogantly when no one could answer the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry said without standing up, she just wanted the class to end quickly so she could leave,  &#34;1) CARNATIONS : These ruffle flowers are perfect for the romantic on a budget. White and pink carnations are popular amongst high schoolers during Valentine&#39;s Day for their low price and sweet sentiment. They stand for new love and have a cheerful blossom. 2) IRISES</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Purple is the color of royalty, so it&#39;s no wonder that these flowers stand for faith and hope. While the most popular color of the Iris flower is blue, they also come in white and yellow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Iris is named after the Greek Goddess, Iris who was thought to link the heavens with the earth and was often personified as a rainbow. These flowers were placed next to graves to help the deceased pass on to the next life before becoming the flower of France, and the Fleur-de-lis. 3) LAVENDER</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This sweet-smelling flower is given to others as a sign of devotion. The scent is calming and is also great for anyone who needs calming or stress relief. There is no surprise that these are a popular flower, with their unique look and therapeutic qualities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is a great flower to plant in your garden and backyard so that you can enjoy the lovely aroma. 4) ROSES</p>

                <p>&#34;Do you have a good plan? Can you tell me what it is about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;, I&#39;ll send some to destroy her thumb, that is all I have to do,&#34; Vera said arrogantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure that will work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you worried about? It would surely work&#34; Vera reassured the girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay let&#39;s quickly leave&#34;</p>

                <p>Hmph, want to destroy her thumb?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t count Vera as anything before, she thought she was just a spoiled rich family daughter who relied on her background to bully others.</p>
