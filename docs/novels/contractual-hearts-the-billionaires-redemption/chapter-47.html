                <p>&#34;I think i just fucking asked you to lay down on the seat properly&#34; The man snarled at her,  scaring her so much his voice sounded like a snake..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, we can talk about this right? How much did the person who sent you give you? My husband can give you three times that&#34; Sherry said despite her fears..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to stall time?&#34; The man asked with a vicious grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shook her head, &#34;N-no&#34; She had never encountered this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she had encountered was the day her mom traveled as always,  Nancy also went to sleep in her classmate house,, so she was the only one at home and she had to sleep alone,, she was having insomnia so she went out in the middle of the night, because she couldn&#39;t sleep and she is sacred to stay alone inside the house, she walked and passed a very dark alley, someone called her from the dark alley, not her name the person said. &#34;Hi&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stopped and looked towards the dark alley, &#34;Please come&#34; the person said she was not even sure if the person was a Male or a Female. She was about to walk towards them when someone suddenly approached her from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked and saw that it was the security man who monitors the house next to her house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening&#34; Sherry greeted the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going to by this time of the night? What do you want to do in that alley&#34; The man asked sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry quickly came clean and told him that someone just called her from the alley now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man pointed a touch light towards the alley but no one was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was shocked, because she was sure someone called her from the alley now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man warned her and told her that human traffickers are roaming now so it is not safe anymore, he followed her home and watched her walk into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that day onward, Sherry would rather stay at home than go outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bitch!&#34; The man hit her head with the back of the gun, Blood seeped out from her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was painful that she felt like shouting but she bit her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man glared at her with no pity in his eyes, &#34;i was asked to rape you first before killing you but now i have lose interest&#34; the man said with disdain in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rape before killing her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who did she offend?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only person who came to her mind was Flow but will she really do that because of a man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she can do something as vicious as this because of a man, then she vowed to repay her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry gave the man a seductive smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seduce him and catch him off guard, the runaway! That was what came into her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled seductively at the man even though she was shaking with fear. She raised her hand and touched the man&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yuck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So disgusting!.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she just entered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man raised an eyebrow at her action and didn&#39;t stop her, maybe he was sure she won&#39;t be able to do anything since she is a girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph! underestimating her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, how about we have sex first?&#34; She asked with and licked her lips seductively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Do you want someone who can satisfy you? I thought they said you are married, but you are actually a bitch! I&#39;ll satisfy you, &#34;the man said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blinked her eyes at him, &#34;Although I&#39;m married, What should I do when he doesn&#39;t satisfy me?&#34; Sherry asked with a sad look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man nodded, &#34;Then I&#39;ll satisfy you&#34; He pushed her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry quickly grabbed the kitchen knife she saw at the backseat and she held it firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, the guy already put his gun in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lay down on top of her, Sherry held the knife at his back, she stabbed him firmly at the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was shocked like he couldn&#39;t believe he let his guard down &#34;Bitch! I&#39;ll kill you!&#34; The man groaned in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry quickly pushed him away and ran out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man brought his gun from his pocket and fired at her. The gun met her left leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell down and groaned in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked back and saw that the man was approaching her already, she looked around and saw the place she was, it was a quiet place and she didn&#39;t see any humans there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was unsure if Bryan will be able to get here in time or not, or if he would be able to locate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gritted her teeth and struggled to stand, she started running even though her leg was in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her run was not too fast but compared to that man, her run was fast because the man was also in pain and still running after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked left and right and saw an alley, she quickly ran towards there, sweats were on her forehead by now, she was enduring the pain from the gun shot with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head felt heavy like she would faint but she endured, she gritted her teeth and continued running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She can&#39;t fall now until she is safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She soon got to the alley and squatted down. The alley was dark but the outside was bright so she could see everything going on outside. The man soon got to the alley. He looked at the alley for a few seconds before running towards the right side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heaved a sigh of relief when she saw that the man took the wrong direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down at the alley, she looked outside not letting down her guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she hoped for right now was for Bryan to get here early. Her body can&#39;t take it anymore and she felt like she would collapse soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she wants right now is to sleep. Her eyes are growing heavier seconds by seconds and she can&#39;t resist opening her eyes anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you will be here,&#34; The man said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry forced her eyes to open and saw the man standing in front of her with a vicious grin on his face. He looked angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the man, her body was already weak so she just gave up and let the man do whatever he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man pointed the gun at her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry closed her eyes solemnly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for the gun shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Bang&#39;</p>
