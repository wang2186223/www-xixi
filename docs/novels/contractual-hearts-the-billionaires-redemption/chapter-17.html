                <p>He sat down by the bed side, and stared at her, his eyes gradually fall on her pink, soft lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bent down and give her a peck on her lips, but he didn&#39;t feel satisfied and depeened the kiss a little. Licking her mouth softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stirred like she was about to wake up because she was feeling a little suffocated, he quickly released her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was suddenly surrounded by water in her dreams.</p>

                <p>Bryan was about to put his hand behind her back to console her, Sherry grabbed his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked relieved, she was soaked in sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan frowned a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a little curious about what her nightmare was but he couldn&#39;t ask her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sound asleep again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to remove his hand from her hand but she held his hand tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.. I won&#39;t do it again&#34; She whispered, her voice sounded sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan stopped moving and let her just hold his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry woke up the next day feeling refreshed, she took her bath and wore a casual clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carried her bag and walked out of her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has lectures today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she walked out of her room, Bryan also walked out of his room. Looking handsome, dark circles formed around his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart raced when she saw how sexy he looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning&#34; Sherry greeted him feeling a bit awkward and nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan ignored her and walked to the living room. She sighed in relief when he ignored her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly remembered that she forgot her phone inside her room. She sighed and walked back into her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw her phone on the table, she picked it and checked to see if she has any messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got a message from Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It says, &#39;Come to my room&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart raced when she saw this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Is he horny and wants to do.?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pinched her waist to stop herself from thinking dirty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of her room, she went to his room, tried to stop her heart that was beating so fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She calm down a bit and knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in&#34; She heard him say from his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and opened the door, the scene she saw surprised her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was inside his room, with a towel tied around his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonned upper body, bulging abdominal muscles, the water dropped on his tanned waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed he just finished taking a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He approached her, Sherry felt the room became warmer making her mouth dry. She subconsciously moved back and cleared her throat, &#34;I saw your text message&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled inwardly when he saw how she acted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Hmph he was sure she won&#39;t be able to resist him&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed he had forgotten that he is the one who has been sneaking into her room and kissing her while she was sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded, his curly hair still dripping. He looked so sexy! Sherry blushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt like pushing him on the bed and rape. Just a taste of this handsome man was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn! She is thinking dirty again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not her fault anyone, it was this man who seduced her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed her an envelope, Sherry took it and looked at him with questions in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your payment for this week&#34; He said his voice sounded sexy in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt the envelope, it was heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forgot that it was just a contract marriage between which would end soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It remains two months and three weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They are not compatible anyway, he is rich and girls will flock around him with a flick of his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be leaving first&#34; She said and walked out of his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hailed a cab to school</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into her class, fortunately the lecturer was not there yet, She went to sit down in her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lecturer arrived within 30 mins and he started teaching them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the lecture ended, Sherry was about to leave the class, when a girl walked towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, the administrator asked you to come to her office immediately,&#34; The girl said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a little confused about why the administrator would be asking her to come but she still made up her mind and went to her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knocked on the door, she entered when she heard a reply from inside..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The school administrator is a woman, she looked beautiful and stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You asked someone to call me?&#34; Sherry asked after greeting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Miss Sherry&#34; The administrator smiled elegantly, she continued &#34;i heard you didn&#39;t attend the flower class last semester and didn&#39;t even do the exam?&#34; Evelyn, the administrator asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry frowned when she heard this, it was true that she didn&#39;t attend the flower class last semester because she found the class boring and she thought it is only for girls who wants to marry into a rich family, she is not interested in getting married or fall in love with someone so she doesn&#39;t really need it, her plan after making enough money was to travel to another country and settle down there then employ a surrogate and after she get pregnant. She will pay him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, i found it boring&#34; Sherry said truthfully, she was a straightforward person and when she doesn&#39;t like something she will say it immediately without bothering to pretend that she likes it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn smiled at how frank Sherry was, &#34;Miss Sherry, the flower class is an important and compulsory course even if you don&#39;t like it. You should still attend it, just bear with it&#34; Evelyn advised her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She liked Sherry a lot, not only is she beautiful, she also have a good grade and she is not proud and very polite most importantly she liked frank and straightforward girls, she made an exception for Sherry because of her good grades that was why she was able to be in the second level, she was supposed to be in the first level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine&#34; Sherry sighed she would just treat it like a normal and boring class then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn smiled when she heard this and dismissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry checked her phone to see the class she was having next, it was the flower class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lips and walked towards where the flower class was being held.</p>
