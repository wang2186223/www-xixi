                <p>Flow face constricted when she heard this, she lost her composure instantly &#34;How is that possible?&#34; Vera stood up from the chair and asked angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Vera, what do you mean?  Are you questioning my intelligence?&#34; Michael looked at her with a stern expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although, he joked around but when he is serious he will say his mind no matter how powerful the person&#39;s background Is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vera bit her lips and sat down a little embarrassed when she saw that everyone in the class was staring at her, &#34;I&#39;m sorry sir&#34; She apologized.</p>

                <p>Sherry is here to snatch everything that belonged to her, she can&#39;t take this lying down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After announcing the scores. Michael started teaching them.</p>

                <p>The lectures lasted for two hours before Michael left their class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow the school beauty is not only a beauty but a genius too&#34; A girl exclaimed in the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes i thought she would be a dumb person but she is actually so intelligent she scored full marks&#34;</p>

                <p>Sherry carried her bag, her expression didn&#39;t change she glanced at Vera when she was about to walk out of the class, she flashed her a provocative smirk before walking out of the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vera was so angry, she almost threw her phone out of her anger, but she quickly composed herself so her gentle image in front of the class will not destroy, sh rush out of the class to her private roomshe was still burning with her anger and threw a flower vases on the floor to relieve her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!!!! I&#39;M SO ANGRY!!!&#34; She yelled and threw a lot of things on the ground..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry hailed a taxi when she got to the school gate, she didn&#39;t know what Vera did even if she knew she didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to the nearest shopping mall&#34; She said as she sat down in the car, and started scrolling through her messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car stopped in twenty minutes. She raised her head up from the phone and looked out of the window and saw that it was a shopping mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paid the man and walked into the mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bought some things she would mostly junk foods and looked for some presentable things because she remembered that Bryan told her this morning that he was going to take her to meet his grandma and she must do her duty by giving his grandma a gift, she chose some tonics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paid the cashier and was about to walk out of the mall when she saw a familiar face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognized the person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Steven, her sister&#39;s ex-boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recalled a funny event that took place before Steven broke up with her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sister was two timing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dating Steven and another guy called Dave at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Sherry knew about it she disapproved of it because then she was still dating her first love Marcus and was a little naive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, her sister and Steven were going out together doing lovey. On the other hand, Sherry was with them that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they were going, Nancy saw Dave at the front. She was shocked and didn&#39;t know what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry also saw Dave at the front and Dave already saw themhe saw the way Nancy was acting towards Steven and he was already walking towards them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry received a message from her sister that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;No matter what happened, don&#39;t say anything just nod your head and play along&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Okay,&#39; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know what her sister was planning and just stood at the other side to watch the show that was about to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy whispered something in Steven&#39;s ear, Steven nodded in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also walked towards Dave and whispered something in his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dave walked towards them, Steven and Dave greeted each other respectfully that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked but she didn&#39;t voice out her question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both left after sometime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry couldn&#39;t control her curiosity and asked Nancy, &#34;Big sis, what did you whisper to them?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told Steven that Dave is my elder brother, I also told Dave that Steven is my elder brother, So how would they react to their brother-in -law?&#34; Nancy chuckled nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked when she heard this, she couldn&#39;t close her mouth for a while before she came back to her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven and Dave later found out the truth, they were mad at Nancy for making a fool of them and they broke up with Nancy later</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry chuckled inwardly when she remembered this incidentshe felt like the men deserved that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked past Steven like she didn&#39;t know him because of the embarrassing incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Sherry?&#34; She heard his voice behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around and glanced at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She feigns a shock expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Steven?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are really Sherry, you have grown up now&#34; Steven said with a warm smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have also become handsome,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven is very handsome but she felt that he is not as handsome as Bryan, Although he wasn&#39;t as handsome as Bryan he is still good lookingshe couldn&#39;t understand why her sister was two timing then, she liked Steven more than Dave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are still a boot licker? Haha&#34; He chuckled at her teasing tone &#34;How is your sister?&#34; Steven asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry could still see the love in his eyes, she guessed that he is still in love with Nancy..she sighed when she remembered the way nancy behaves now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is fine,&#34; Sherry replied, deciding not to say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Steven said, his eyes full of sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just came back from abroad?&#34; Sherry asked when she saw the sadness in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Steven broke up with Nancy, he traveled to the United Kingdom to further his education and he has not seen her sister for seven years now.</p>
