                <p>Sherry nodded, not noticing the doctor&#39;s odd behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We want to go and do something urgent, can I go?&#34; Bryan asked the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you can go anywhere with the help of a wheelchair&#34; The doctor said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at Sherry smugly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph he would register their marriage today. So she wouldn&#39;t have a chance to go back on her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shook her head at his childish behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you doctor&#34; Sherry thanked the doctor sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor blushed again, &#34;It is my responsibility&#34; The doctor said bashfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor and the nurse walked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calvin is here, let&#39;s go&#34; Bryan said when the doctor and the nurse walked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She helped him into the wheelchair and pushed him out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin opened the door, they both helped Bryan into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry opened the boot and put the wheelchair there, She walked towards the second door and sat down next to Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin started the car and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They drove for an hour before he took a turn at the final traffic light and then pulled to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked out of the window, the wordings on the building were clear as day: Diamond city civil affairs bureau marriage registry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart pounded, she sat down in a daze and didn&#39;t even notice that Calvin had helped Bryan out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time she was getting married for real. She had always dated or had a contract marriage but she never married before she was afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? You don&#39;t want to take responsibility for me? I&#39;ve spent all my first time with you, first kiss, the first time I&#39;ve ever seen a woman, the first time doing it but you still don&#39;t want to take responsibility for me?&#34; He asked with a look of grievance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s mouth twitched, why does it keep making her look like a scumbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have not applied my makeup, marriage picture is for a lifetime i have to look beautiful&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded, his eyes softened when he heard that she was not reluctant to marry. To be honest, he was afraid, he was afraid that she would change her mind. That was why he wanted to quickly register their marriage so she wouldn&#39;t have time to change her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry took out some of her makeup stuff and started applying it on her face. She finished within 30 minutes and walked out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan glanced at her deeply with deep affection in his eyes. She walked towards him and said in a small voice, &#34;Let&#39;s go&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed his wheelchair and they walked into the civil affairs bureau, an unconscious smile appeared on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a working day and the crowd was thin, Because people who get married every day are not much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they stepped into the civil affairs and, one of the staff members walked towards them, he bowed respectfully when he saw them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Tony, Mrs Tony&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t reply because her mind was somewhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took them to a place and gave them the documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon receiving the documents, Sherry&#39;s hand trembled slightly as she held the pen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her head slightly and saw that Bryan had already finished signing the documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up at her after he finished signing his name on the documents, Sherry withdrew her gaze from him and looked at the documents, she hesitated for a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is she making the right decision?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan&#39;s eyes turned cold when he saw her hesitation but he didn&#39;t say anything and just watched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed and signed her name on the documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes softened when he saw that she signed her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the papers from her and handed them over to the staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host staff said, &#34;May I know if you come here to marry willingly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded and answered firmly, &#34;Yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host glanced at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry hesitated for a few seconds and replied, &#34;Yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan&#39;s tense expression relaxed when he heard her reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The certificate issuer officially pronounced them as man and wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They took some pictures and they were given the marriage certificate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked out of the civil affairs bureau together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe that she was really married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are really married?&#34; She exclaimed in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded, &#34;That is right we are officially married, you are officially mine&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was married to the person he has been looking for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were now married as man and wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawful man and wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart melted when he kept repeating this, his heart was full of joy and contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked into the car, Sherry sat down next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin started the car and drove out of the civil affairs bureau.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tonight is our wedding night&#34; He whispered in a sensual way into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed and moved away from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was easy to know what she was thinking about when Bryan saw her blushed, his eyes darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved and took some documents out from the seat. He dropped them on her lap, &#34;Have a look&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was confused but she still obediently flipped the documents opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the property deed of his companies, his houses and some of his assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry raised her head and looked at him, confused, &#34;Why is it only my name there?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is ours, whatever is mine is yours and whatever is yours will be yours&#34; He said with a tone of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart raced, she felt happy and warm but she didn&#39;t show it and looked at him with an indifferent look, &#34;You&#39;ve transferred all your assets under my name, Are you not afraid that I&#39;ll run away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; He said and continued unhurriedly &#34;My stamp is on you now so no matter how you run you will always be mine&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she runs away, she won&#39;t be able to get married to someone else because they already registered their marriage unless they divorced then she can marry someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly turned into a billionairess in a day?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin stopped the car, Sherry looked out of the window and saw that they were not at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around and looked at him, puzzled, &#34;Where is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, &#34;We have to buy rings&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah? There is ring?&#34; She exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan didn&#39;t answer her question, Calvin helped him out of the car, he waved for Sherry to get down from the car also.</p>
