                <p>His grandmother has been pressuring him to be married, but he is not yet ready to propose or to go down the aisle. His grandmother asked him to get married so she could pass away peacefully after receiving a lung cancer diagnosis that has given her only three months to live. He gave her that promise. He refused to marry her friend&#39;s daughter after she told him a week to do so or she would force him to do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was a young child, his parents perished in a car accident. Since his parents&#39; passing, his grandma has been caring for him, and he values and loves her greatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan undid his tie and was about to walk upstairs, he stopped on his track and stared at the figure lying down on the couch. He sighed and walked towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little fool, if she knew that she was feeling sleepy why can&#39;t she go sleep in one of the rooms?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why he told her before he left to feel at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried in a bridal style gently so she wouldn&#39;t wake up, he walked into a room beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dropped her on the bed gently, he covered her body with a blanket securely, he couldn&#39;t believe that he was this caring to a lady except his grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to leave the room when she held his hand tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held his hand and moved it to her heart with tears on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be more obedient, P-please don&#39;t leave me&#34; She muttered and held his hand tightly like she was scared that he would really leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at her in shock, he observed her face to see if she was just pretending or if she was really sleeping but she was really sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let her be and just watched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t send me away okay? I&#39;ll really be good, I will obey everything you told me okay?&#34; She muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay i won&#39;t leave&#34; Bryan replied even though he doesn&#39;t know what she is dreaming about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt her hand loosen up a little bit when she heard, he then gently removed his hand from hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally succeeded, he walked out of her room immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry woke up in a daze, she looked and was surprised when she saw where she was. She quickly climbed out of the bed in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where is this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday a memory flowed into her head. She remembered that she lay down on the couch to take a nap but she fell into a deep sleep instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who carried her into this room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it Bryan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the only person she was sure that did it because this is a house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around the room and observed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was beautiful and welcoming, Sherry had never seen this kind of grandeur and elegance before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was as big as her house!.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bed was a king size bed and it had blankets and a duvet covered in sheets of a floral pink design.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her best color was pink also, the bed was three times bigger than her bed at her house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pillows were inside matching pillowcases. It looked soft. It made her understand that the reason why her last night&#39;s sleep was so splendid was because of the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn this is really heaven on earth!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her right, she saw a couple of doors which she presumed would probably be the bathroom and closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she looked around she noticed that her luggage was already in the room! She guessed that it was Bryan who brought it in last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked the time on her phone and realized that it was 8am in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn! She is late for class!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the pillow&#39;s fault who asked it to be so soft that she doesn&#39;t want to wake up anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly took her bath and put on casual clothes, she carried her bag and walked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she walked out of her room, she almost opened her mouth in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so breathtaking, as she expected yesterday in the hallway. She saw a large and fancy open space. Velvet curtains were tied to let the sunshine through the window and she saw antique looking, brass candelabras which hung on the wall in between the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no English name to describe this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question that she thought of yesterday popped into her mind again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who is this man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What identity does he have?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she didn&#39;t see anyone yesterday, was he living alone? By himself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued to walk down the stairs slowly, the stairs were so long that she almost fainted on the stairs but the scene she was looking at kept her busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon she got to the second floor, it also had a very long hallway, there was a gigantic chandelier of an incredibly vast scale, far prettier and breathtaking than the one she saw yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon she got to the living room, she saw Bryan sitting down on the couch with a document in his hand, she was heaving because of her long staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised his head and stared at her in shock, &#34;You walked through the stairs?&#34; He asked as he looked at her from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Sherry nodded and replied indifferently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a little shocked when he heard this, even though his male pals can&#39;t climb the stairs they would use the elevator but she actually did it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a little impressed when she saw that she was not like those delicate girls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is an elevator you can use&#34; he pointed at a door beside the stairs, &#34;That is the elevator&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry nodded when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why didn&#39;t she think of that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dumb her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she wants to look around the house too so she doesn&#39;t lose or gain anything anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Sherry i&#34;</p>
