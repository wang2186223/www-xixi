                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Sherry replied with no intentions to explain further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carried the alcohol glass in front of her and downed it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry took out a pack of cigarettes from her bag. She took a stick from it and lit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara was shocked when she saw her smoking, &#34;You smoke?&#34; She asked surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so gentle and innocent so she found it hard to believe that she really smokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is right I&#39;m a rich old man&#39;s mistress too and I think I&#39;m a thief too. Do you still want to be my friend? I&#39;ll only mislead you&#34; Sherry warned with a serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara shook her head firmly &#34;I don&#39;t believe that you are a mistress, And I don&#39;t believe that you are thief too&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry chuckled at her stubborn expression. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded firmly &#34;Yes&#34; and added, &#34;Besides I&#39;m willing to be misled by you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is really cute with her puffed cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm Where is this?&#34; Tara asked Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love coming here whenever I&#39;m in a bad mood,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she is always alone and sometimes you won&#39;t feel like going home, And expect home she doesn&#39;t have anywhere else she can go She found it by chance and realized that people rarely come here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, it is so beautiful&#34; Tara exclaimed and stared at Sherry with a sincere look, &#34;Thank you for bringing me here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew how difficult it is for someone like Sherry to be open minded and carefree.. So she was really grateful she brought her here</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only means that she has become her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt a little sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why didn&#39;t she meet someone like Tara in high school but met a bitch like Wendy instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry treated her like a sister and best friend but she betrayed her in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met Wendy when she was in high school. They met in a church Sherry usually attended to pray for God to bless her mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They became best friends, Sherry was already attending a high school named Nicholas High School before she met Wendy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy told her a lot of exciting things about her Nevermore high school. Sherry wished to go so she can also experience the things there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she told her mom about it and lied about how Nicholas was a bad school, Sherry badmouth Nicholas high school so much that her mom quickly withdrew her from the high school and registered her in Nevermore high school paying a huge sum of money again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when her nightmare started. It started when she was first framed by her classmate that she stole her money..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was in Grade 5 while Wendy was in Grade 6 then so she never suspected that Wendy was behind it and she believed that Wendy would never do that to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy asked her to admit that she stole her classmate&#39;s money even though she never did, she told her that if she admitted it her classmate would forgive and forget everything and would keep it a secret but if she didn&#39;t admit it they would report to the school administrator and it could result in her being expelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could still remember her gentle voice when she told her that and the look on her face like she believed her and support her, &#34;Sherry, just admit it that you stole the money, I&#39;ll beg your classmate to forget about it and not to spread rumors as her senior I&#39;m sure she will obey&#34; And she added, &#34;Besides you just got admitted to Nevermore, your mom spent all of her money, do you want her to spend a lot of money again?&#34; Wendy asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom was her weakness, she was struggling to make money everyday so she didn&#39;t want her to spend a huge sum of money again so she admitted to it because she was afraid of being expelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry took one of the alcohol and drank it on a go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara quickly stopped her and collected the alcohol from her, she already drank it to half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you drinking so much?&#34; Tara complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t get drunk easily,&#34; Sherry replied and took the bottle from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara didn&#39;t stop her after hearing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I envy you. I get drunk easily&#34; Tara pouted at how easy she always gets drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So don&#39;t drink a lot&#34; Sherry warned</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was flushed and red by now, and she was starting to feel dizzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fall in love, Tara All men are jerk&#34; Sherry said, feeling a little giddy from the alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay i won&#39;t&#34; Tara replied seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? We will be single forever, pinky promise?&#34; Sherry turned around and stared at Tara with her last finger up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara put her last finger on Sherry&#39;s finger and crossed it, &#34;Pinky promise&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was delighted after their promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph, no man would be able to snatch Tara from her now and they won&#39;t know how good she is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She will be the only one who knows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is very possessive once she chooses a person as her best friend, even if the person talks with another girl she would be very jealous because the person&#39;s attention would not be on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was in a good mood after their promises and started singing although she was drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was still nice and soothing, unique to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made people feel comfortable and it didn&#39;t feel like she was drunk at all.</p>
