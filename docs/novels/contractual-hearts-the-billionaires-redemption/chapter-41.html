                <p>Bryan opened his eyes slowly, feeling confused, he looked at his surroundings and realized that he was at the hospital. He was about to sit up when his hand touched someone&#39;s hand. He looked down, shocked and saw that it was Sherry. She looked exhausted and was deep asleep. He didn&#39;t dare to move so he wouldn&#39;t wake her up. He just watched her quietly, he did feel tired or bothered looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved in her sleep, like she was uncomfortable, before her eyes slowly opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are awake?&#34; She sat up straight immediately when she saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has been a while that you are awake? You should have woken me up, are you thirsty?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan could see the concern in her eyes and felt happy, &#34;No i just woke and I&#39;m not thirsty&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him, worried, &#34;Are you hungry? I&#39;ll go and get food&#34; She stood up and walked out of the room without waiting for his reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked back into the room within ten minutes with a tray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put the tray beside him, &#34;The doctor said you should porridge for now&#34; She said and put a spoon into the bowl and handed it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan didn&#39;t accept it, &#34;Feed me&#34; He said and gave her a seductive smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt her heart rise when she saw his smile, she blushed. Fortunately the room was dark because it was late so he didn&#39;t notice it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stammered, &#34;Y-you don&#39;t you have hands?&#34; She said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan gave a helpless sigh , &#34;My hand hurts, I can&#39;t lift it, what should I do?&#34; He gave a pitiful look and continued, &#34;But since you don&#39;t want to help me I&#39;ll have to force myself&#34; He said and moved like he wanted to take the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt bad and guilty for him, she quickly dodge his hand and said, &#34;Forget it I&#39;ll feed you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t notice, she started feeding him spoon by spoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Till he stopped her and told her that &#39;it is okay&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded and poured water on a glass cup, she handed it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then remembered that Grandma told her to call her when Bryan woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma went home earlier, because the doctor said Bryan&#39;s wounds are not serious and he could be discharged in a week</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma didn&#39;t want to leave before but Sherry persuaded her that she would call her once Bryan woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out her cell phone and dialed Grandma&#39;s phone number. It rang and she picked up the first ring. It was obvious that she was waiting for her call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Grandma&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma&#39;s anxious voice could be heard on the phone, &#34;Hello Sherry, has he woke up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled and answered, &#34;Yes he just woke up&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has he eaten?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he just finished the porridge Aunty Gladys brought, i warmed it before giving it to him&#34; Sherry told her everything so she would stop getting anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma sighed in relief when she heard, &#34;That is good, thank you Sherry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt more guilty when she heard, it was because of her rashness that made a car hit Bryan in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is my duty, Grandma,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma sighed and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Edge quickly held Grandma&#39;s hand after she finished making the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she suspicious of me?&#34; Aunty Edge said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I told you she won&#39;t be suspicious of you,&#34; Grandma replied and asked Aunty Gladys to help her back to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Edge sighed in relief after hearing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Grandma who asked her to put drugs into Sherry&#39;s drink. She was feeling so guilty that she left the house that night and went back to the old madam&#39;s house, she didn&#39;t even dare to show up at the hospital when she heard that Bryan had an accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t possibly tell Sherry that it was Grandma who asked her to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry hung up and sat down beside Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just finished talking to Grandma&#34; Bryan asked, it was not a question but a statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34; Sherry nodded and continued, &#34;She is getting old so i asked Aunty Gladys to take her home&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded in satisfaction after hearing this, &#34;Good Job, my wife&#34; He said and ruffled her help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed under his passionate gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression turned serious again, &#34;You have agreed to take responsibility for me, we will go and register our marriage tomorrow morning&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked and asked in exclamation, &#34;Is that not too fast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised an eyebrow at her question, &#34;Too fast? You took my virginity that i have been keeping for twenty six years and you are reluctant to take responsibility?&#34; He asked with a disappointed expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s mouth twitched when she saw his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like she was some scumbag who took his virginity and doesn&#39;t want to be responsible for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him, confused, &#34;Y-you You are a virgin? Like you have never done it with anyone before?&#34; She asked, still not believing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan knitted his brows, &#34;What? Pretending to be ignorant so you won&#39;t take responsibility for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry quickly waved her hand, &#34;No no it is not like that&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just confused, if he was a virgin why would he just keep doing it non stop the whole night. She felt embarrassed to ask him and quickly shut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan clapped his hand, &#34;Good it is decided then, we will go and register our marriage tomorrow&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry still felt it was a little rushed and asked, &#34;Why so fast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at her with an aggrieved look, &#34;I&#39;m just afraid someone would not take responsibility for me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry: &#34;..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is it not supposed to be the other way round? But nevertheless she was sure if she continued hesitating he would probably feel resentful towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No i meant that, you should wait till you get discharged before we consider that, no?&#34; Sherry said with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled discreetly when he saw that she was concern about him, &#34;No I&#39;m fine&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at her intently all of a sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt a bad premonition when she saw him looking at her intently, she felt like she got goosebumps. &#34;W-what?&#34; She stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan fixed his gaze at her, &#34;Have you returned the money that woman gave you?&#34; He raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart sank when he finished his word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>W-what? he wants to take her money again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it her fault?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman has so much money and wants to waste it so she is just trying to help her by taking her money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him vigilantly and shook her head honestly, &#34;No i have not&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? You will take responsibility for me and won&#39;t leave in the future, so why haven&#39;t you returned the money yet? Do you plan to run away and not take responsibility for me?&#34; Bryan asked with a disappointed expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pursues her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is her money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loved money a lot, more than her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever she was depressed or sad, thinking that she had money to accompany her She wouldn&#39;t feel lonely anymore so she always grabbed any opportunity to earn money no matter how dangerous it was.</p>
