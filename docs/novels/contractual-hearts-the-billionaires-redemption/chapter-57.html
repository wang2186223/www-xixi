                <p>Sherry woke up early the next day, feeling energetic. Bryan decided to let her rest so they didn&#39;t have sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around the room but no one was inside the room, she thought he was in the kitchen cooking as usual. She stood up and walked into the bathroom to take a shower, she put on some clothes and carried her bag. She is going to school today, the school exam is three days from now and she will finally graduate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the room and walked into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bryan?&#34; She called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the kitchen but no one was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she went to the dining room, she saw a food flask on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened it and it contained food. The aroma of the food made her mouth dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked beside the food and saw a paper, she took it and opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Babe, i went to the company so i made some food for you before going make sure you eat it while it is hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Your hubby&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed at the last sentence &#39;hubby&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down and started eating, the food was so delicious that she wished it never ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finished eating within twenty minutes, She stood up and drank some water before walking out of the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning Young Madam&#34; David said immediately he saw her coming out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, David,&#34; Sherry smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the car door for her and closed it once she got in. He turned around and opened the driver seat, he got in too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got to her school within forty five minutes, there was no traffic on the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry asked him to stop at the school gate and got out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just come back later to pick me up,&#34; Sherry told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David nodded, &#34;Okay Young Madam&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled and walked into the school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed and walked into her class, Tara was waving at her immediately she walked into the class so she could see where she sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled and walked towards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are finally here,&#34; Tara smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm, when did you come?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An hour ago&#34; Tara said in a nonchalant tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded and sat down next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara turned around and looked at her coincidentally her eyes met the love bite on her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She narrowed her eyes, &#34;Are you hiding something from me?&#34; Tara asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? What do you mean?&#34; Sherry asked and looked at her, she followed her gaze and saw the love bite on her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was shocked, she didn&#39;t even know when he did it, the love bite looked fresh so she was sure he did it today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34; Sherry started but she stopped talking when the lecturer walked into the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell you later,&#34; Sherry whispered to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine&#34; Tara had a sullen look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt guilty when she saw the sullen look on her face but she quickly focused on the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The class lasted for an hour before the lecturer walked out of the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;m all ears&#34; Tara said and continued with a sad face, &#34;I can&#39;t believe you hid something from me while i tell you everything about me, even the night i lost my first time with a male escort i told you everything, am i really your friend, Sherry?&#34; Tara asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated the fact that she hid something from her, when she told her everything except her identity as an heiress. But she told everything going on in her life, because she already saw her as her friend, someone close to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pursed her lips, feeling  bad when she saw her sad face, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m used to keeping it to myself that is why, i won&#39;t do that anymore&#34; Sherry looked at her with a pitiful face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara&#39;s heart melted when she saw her pitiful face and forgave her but she acted like she was still mad at her, &#34;Quickly spill it, did you guys finally do it?&#34; Tara asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, we got married last week,&#34; Sherry told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara froze, she looked at her in shock, &#34;For real?&#34; She asked with surprise in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow I&#39;m so happy for you&#34; Tara said in a sincere tone, her expression was also sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she just doesn&#39;t understand is why she agreed to marry him. She was sure it was not because of taking responsibility or anything. She just decided to enjoy it while it lasted because feelings changed, he might be head over heels for her now but what about in future?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t believe in such words of finality because people&#39;s feelings change. Life was unpredictable. However, she still agreed to marry just till when it lasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is ready for divorce anytime because he can ask for divorce anytime. She doesn&#39;t know why he wants to marry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t believe that he really loves her or fancy her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love is already dead and it already ceased to exist, that is her belief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was also not sure of the feelings she had for him yet. She cared about him and would like to spend more time with him besides she doesn&#39;t hate his kisses or touches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for her marriage with him, she would just keep looking to see the result.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took it out from her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Old Madam, his Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked it and put it on his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Grandma&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, how are you doing?&#34; Grandma&#39;s old voice was heard on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, Grandma,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already treated his Grandma as hers too because of the affection she showed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; Grandma asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in school, but I&#39;m leaving now, why?&#34; Sherry asked..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made some healthy soup for you and Bryan but he should be at his office, can you go and give it to him at the office??&#34; Grandma asked..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure Grandma I will,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great!! I&#39;ll ask your Aunt Gladys to deliver it to your school&#34; Grandma said, her tone sounded elated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Grandma,&#34; Sherry nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good!&#34; Grandma said and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Tara asked with an eyebrow raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am going to his company,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, after getting married you don&#39;t want to separate from each other even for a minute&#34; Tara said with a jealous tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not jealous, she was just pretending to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I can&#39;t be too. How do you feel?&#34; Sherry said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara looked at her with a hurt expression, &#34;You are so unfair to single people&#34; Tara said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you are jealous, go and get married too&#34; Sherry said with a cheeky smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, what about your promise of being single together, You went back on your words&#34; Tara raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Did I say that? Why can&#39;t I remember?&#34; Sherry asked, pretending not to remember what she is talking about and continued, &#34;I think i have selective amnesia&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmph, you went back on your words and pretended to have selective amnesia,  despicable!&#34; Tara said and added, &#34;I&#39;ll call my lawyer and sue you to court&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry laughed freely, she felt so happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this is how it is when you have amazing friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara looked at her in a daze, she snapped out of her daze and exclaimed, &#34;Laugh more you look so beautiful when you laugh&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was about to reply when her phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Aunty Gladys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that she was outside her school gate so she didn&#39;t pick it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up from her seat, &#34;I&#39;m leaving first&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara nodded, &#34;Go meet your husband, Hmph. I&#39;m not your friend anymore&#34; Tara said and looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled and knew that she was just kidding, so she walked out of the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw David outside the school gate, with Aunty Gladys waiting for her.</p>
