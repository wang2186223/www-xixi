                <p>Bryan grinned after watching the footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is really the one!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked into the living room, not noticing anything amiss he walked towards Sherry, Sherry stood up when she saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan put a hand on her waist and pecked her lightly on her lips, &#34;Thank you for agreeing to be my wife&#34; He whispered in a low tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was stunned, she stared at him in a daze as her heart raced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him, a little puzzled because of his weird behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma grinned when she saw this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan took her into his arms, looking at old madam, he said, &#34;Grandma, we are going back&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should go back quickly, drive carefully&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled at the old madam, &#34;it is getting late, So we will go back first. Sleep early Grandma and make sure you use your drugs&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go back and make a baby so i can play with&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded seriously, &#34;we will do as you want&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed a little when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn! What is this man saying?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan whispered to Sherry&#39;s ear, &#34;Let&#39;s go and make babies for Grandma&#34; His voice sounded so sexual and hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed furiously and had to pinch herself so she wouldn&#39;t fall for his honey traps, they would divorce soon so he is just saying it to appease his Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma laughed with delight when she saw this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was taken to the car and then put on the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow watched all their movements, seeing Bryan putting Sherry on the passenger seat carefully and gently like he was afraid that she would get hurt, Flow had to pinch her own arm and almost ripped her bottom lip with her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan caught sight of her, when Flow saw that Bryan had seen her, she immediately gave a gentle smile like she was not jealous, &#34;Brother Bryan, i want to&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan didn&#39;t give her a glance, he got into the car and drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow bit her lips when she saw this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is all that bitch&#39;s fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no choice but to turn back and walked back into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grand&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t call me that it is disgusting hearing it from you!&#34; Grandma yelled at her, her expression was cold unlike the expression she showed to Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face became pale when she heard this. She looked at her with tears brimming in her eyes, &#34;Grandma what&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I just told you not to call me that.. I don&#39;t have a scheming Granddaughter like you&#34; Grandma glared at her with coldness brimming in her eyes She looked at Flow in disappointment, &#34;You&#39;ve changed You were never like this before&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow faced become paler, &#34;Grandma i can explain&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma gave her a mockery smile, &#34;You can explain, by saying your friend gave it to you? Do you take me for a fool? Leave! You are not welcome here&#34; Grandma yelled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow face turned ashen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No she can&#39;t leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was because of the Bryan family power that people respected a lot Although the Cunningham family is powerful, it was like an ant beside the Bryan family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face turned teary, &#34;Grandma I&#39;m so&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunty Gladys, escort Miss Cunningham out,&#34; Grandma said, not giving her a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she not understand Flow tricks? It also happened to her when she married Bryan&#39;s grandfather, she really treated Flow as her granddaughter but her behavior is unacceptable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow bit her lips when she saw this, &#34;Grandma I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ll come when your anger subside&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left unwilling with resentment brimming in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all Sherry&#39;s fault.. She would make her pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Sherry and Bryan just got home Sherry was about to open the door and got down when Bryan held her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm.. Miss Sherry, you know Grandma sent Aunty Edge here not only to cook but also monitor us you understand?&#34; Bryan started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So we will start living in the same room from now on,&#34; Bryan added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ok&#34; Sherry agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled, he would take it step by step If he showed her his intentions now, she might run away And he would never let her go, he would make sure she fell in love with him slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry got down from the car, Bryan put a hand on her waist and they walked into the house together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Edge walked out of the kitchen when she heard the door open, &#34;You are back&#34; Aunty Edge smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34; Sherry smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked into Bryan&#39;s room together with Aunty Edge watchful eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go take a shower in the guest room, you can take a shower here&#34; Bryan said and walked out without waiting for Sherry reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry walked into the bathroom and showered.. After she finished taking a shower, she then remembered that her clothes were still in her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t possibly walk back to her room naked, so she opened Bryan&#39;s wardrobe and took out one of his long shirts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore it and it is moderate enough so she walked to the bed and lay down there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan walked in and saw her laying down on his bed, he took out his phone and started texting someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked towards the other side of the bed and lay down beside her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt a little restless in his mind because of the beauty sleeping by his side, he rolled towards her and lay down on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked when she saw this, &#34;What a-are you doing?&#34; She stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan put his hand on his lip, &#34;Shh Aunty Edge is here&#34; He whispered and put his head on her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loved her smell, it was the same smell as five years ago. He took a deep breath inhaling her smell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his head and stared at her, she looked so sexy, he felt his lips turned dry, his Adams apple bobbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze landed on her soft, pink lips, he sealed his lips with hers and kissed her wildly till she was out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his head and stared down at her, her face was flushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put his lips on her neck, he bit and nibbled on them giving her a love bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room door suddenly opened, Aunty Edge walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was shocked when she saw this scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry young master, i didn&#39;t see anything you can continue&#34; Aunty Edge quickly walked out of the room and closed the door a little confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the young master was busy, why would he text her to his room two minutes ago?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put away her thoughts, and pulled out her phone to call the old madam and tell her the good news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should be expecting a little master soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Bryan&#39;s room, Bryan&#39;s pulled away unwillingly from Sherry and lay down on the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched as she tried to catch her breath, her face was flushed and looked alluring, he felt his crotch stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed in a low tone and walked into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was confused when she saw him walking into the bathroom again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just took a shower just now, why is he taking a shower again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And how did he know that Aunty Edge is coming to his room?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry fell asleep with questions in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the scene of her sleeping that Bryan saw when he walked out of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her beautiful, adorable face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed her lips lightly, &#34;Good night&#34; he whispered.</p>
