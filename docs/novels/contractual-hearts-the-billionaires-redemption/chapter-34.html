                <p>&#34;Wow, i can never get tired of hearing your voice&#34; Tara said after Sherry finished singing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled brightly, &#34;Don&#39;t betray me I&#39;ll sing for you anytime you want&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry slumped down and fell asleep after saying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm, i won&#39;t&#34; Tara replied not knowing that Sherry has fallen asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around and glanced at Sherry when she didn&#39;t hear a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry&#34; Tara called in a low tone but there was no movement from her.</p>

                <p>Tara opened her bag and took out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caller was &#39;Mr Bryan&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked it up and put the phone on ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; Tara heard a deep voice asked on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Sherry just fell asleep,&#34; Tara replied..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man narrowed his eyes on the other side and asked, &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m her friend&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you right now?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you to her first?&#34; Tara asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m her husband&#34;. Bryan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara laughed after hearing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you are husband, why will she save your contact as Mr Bryan?&#34; She continued without waiting for his reply, &#34;I&#39;ll tell her you called when she woke up&#34; Tara told him and hung up immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was angry when he heard this.. But he quickly calmed down when he remembered that she had not fallen for him yet that was why his number was saved as Mr Bryan..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dialed a number and put the phone on his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me locate a number&#34; He said immediately when the other person picked the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung up and sent the number to the person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person called him back within ten minutes and told him the location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan stood up and walked out of his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin drove him to the location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got there in 30 mins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan walked out of the car and and walked towards the garden. It was dead silent like no one was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still continued walking down, he finally saw a figure lying down on the floor. He looked around and saw a girl beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, I&#39;m here to pick my wife up,&#34; Bryan told the girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara raised to look at the man</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as their eyes met, Tara almost gaped. The man before her was good looking- no good looking was actually a huge understatement. She was sure he was hundred times more handsome than any celebrity she had ever seen. His only dark hair looked like it was combed by his fingers and swept back away from his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a strong, defined and masculine jawline- it was perfection in her eyes. He just looked too good to be true. She was utterly impressed, and she had never been impressed by a man&#39;s beauty like this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could a mortal man look this stunning? But his eyes were ice cold and looked bottomless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm Sherry is your wife?&#34; Tara asked after admiring the man&#39;s beautiful face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34; Bryan replied and carried Sherry into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara felt betrayed after hearing this, They just made a promise to stay single forever but she actually had a handsome husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara nodded after hearing this She followed Bryan behind leaving the alcohol and the things they bought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only carried her bag and Sherry&#39;s bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked out of the garden together. Calvin walked out of the car after seeing Bryan coming with someone in his arms He quickly opened the back seat door for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan gently put Sherry down on the back seat and closed the car door. He turned around and glanced at Tara, &#34;Do you want a ride?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, my driver is here&#34; Tara rejected him She gave Sherry&#39;s bag to him and watched them drive away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got into her car, &#34;Young Miss&#34; her driver greeted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara nodded, &#34;Follow that car&#34; She said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t fully trust the man&#39;s word so she got her driver to follow his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed till the car stopped at a house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara gasped when she saw how huge and beautiful the house was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I still continue following the car?&#34; Her driver asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara shook her head, &#34;No let&#39;s go&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan knew Tara was trailing after them but he acted like he doesn&#39;t know, She is not a resident of the estate so she couldn&#39;t enter normally but Bryan told the security to let her in that was why she could enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried Sherry into his arms and walked towards the house. He walked into the living room, Aunty Edge walked out of her room when she heard the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to young madam?&#34; She asked worriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan shook his head, &#34;She is fine She is just drunk and falls asleep&#34; Bryan reassures her when he sees the worried look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I prepare a hangover soup for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you can do that tomorrow, she has fallen asleep now&#34; Bryan said and carried Sherry into his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laid her down on the bed and used the blanket to cover her body but she removed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hot&#34; She said and waved her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry be good&#34; Bryan said and tried to cover her body with a blanket once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry opened her eyes and looked at the man in front of her, &#34;Pretty young brother&#34; she said and giggled like her words amused her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him, shocked, &#34;You know my name? Have you been eying this big sister?&#34; She said her words were slippery and sluggish because of the alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be good, use the blanket to cover your body&#34; The man tried to use it to cover her body once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I am feeling hot&#34; Sherry pouted and stared at him pitifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man didn&#39;t fall for her trap and said firmly, &#34;use the blanket so you won&#39;t fall sick&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sighed dramatically, &#34;That is why I believed that all men are jerks Even the pretty boy in front of me doesn&#39;t care about how i feel&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan bit his lower lip to prevent himself from laughing out so as not to agitate her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one loves me&#34; She said sadly and turned her head away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her figure looks so lonely on the bed that it made his heart ache for her &#34;Mm, i love you tho&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry turned around and looked at him, &#34;Really?&#34; She raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him not believing him, &#34;Lies, all men are liars, sweet talkers and jerks&#34; She said and turned away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, all men are like that Use the blanket&#34; the man gave up and used the blanket to cover her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry removed the blanket and started crying loudly, &#34;You are bullying me A beautiful lady like him&#34; She continued crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan panicked when she started crying and removed the blanket from her body, &#34;Okay, you don&#39;t have to use the blanket anymore so stop crying&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped crying and closed her eyes to sleep happily after this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Knock&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan stood up and walked towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Aunty Edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Young Madam cry, is she alright?&#34; Aunty Edge asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she is fine Don&#39;t worry about her&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Edge nodded and walked back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan closed the door, he was shocked by what he saw when he looked back at Sherry.</p>
