                <p>Sherry was discharged from the hospital five days later after Bryan made sure the doctor did a full body check up on her before he finally relented and drove her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was more than happy when she finally left the hospital, She hated the hospital smell a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She falls asleep peacefully when she finally gets to her room.</p>

                <p>Sherry had classes today after taking five days leave in school when she was at the hospital, so she woke up very early and got ready for school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left home early too because she has been trying to avoid Bryan since the day he forcefully kissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into her class, her course mates were already in the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down at her seat and plugged in an earphone in her ears. She loved music a lot, when she was alone in her high school when everyone abandoned it was the music that made her become stronger sometimes. She also loved singing and wanted to be a famous singer but she started hating staying in a crowded place since high school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was framed, a lot of people surrounded her and stoned her. Since then she has been afraid of staying in crowded places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is why she liked staying alone too, she hated conflict when you have friends they will surely be one conflict or the other. Especially, if they are girls and you are beautiful they would be jealous of your beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She composed a lot of music to keep herself under control when she was in high school. She couldn&#39;t possibly fight the whole school. It was a very terrible experience and she doesn&#39;t want to recall them anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was in a deep thought when someone tapped her on her shoulder, she turned around to look at who the person was. She unplugged her earphones from her ears when she saw that it was Tara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, i have been saying &#39;hi&#39; to you but you didn&#39;t hear me because of the earphones&#34; Tara explained with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry nodded understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t like talking anymore, especially if it is someone she is not familiar with. It is not that she is shy but she felt uncomfortable talking to a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the time, she nodded her head or shook her when someone asked her a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara smiled and sat down next to her, &#34;The music competition is today, did you know that?&#34; Tara started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry frowned when she heard, she didn&#39;t know that She didn&#39;t even remember anything about the competition, she suddenly recalled what she heard Vera saying in the washroom about destroying her thumb</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the music competition the same as the piano competition?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara smiled when she heard this, this was the first time Sherry asked her a question on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34; Tara replied and continued, &#34;are you participating?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t interested in showing off her singing talent before but when she remembered what Vera said at the washroom.. She wants to participate and destroy her good plan since she is bored anyway..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hehe, so you are going to participate this semester You didn&#39;t participate last semester tho it was Vera who won last semester competition&#34; Tara grinned at her and added, &#34;I believe you will come first&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry gave her an odd look when she heard this &#34;Why do you believe that I would come first?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara blinked her eyes at her &#34;It is because you are my role model, my role model is perfect and unbeatable&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stared at her to see if she was sincere, but all she could see in her clear bright eyes were sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sighed and pursue her lower lips, &#34;I&#39;m not perfect&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara nodded, &#34;No one is perfect, so in 100% I&#39;ll give you 99%&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled, she started liking Tara a little bit, &#34;Why didn&#39;t you choose Vera as your role model?&#34; Sherry asked, a little curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara shook her head with disgust in her eyes, &#34;She is a white lotus, i hate pretenders She pretend to be humble and gentle but her venom is more dangerous than a snake&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry smiled a little when she heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even naive Tara could tell who is a white lotus and who is not but she has been friends with Wendy for five years but she still couldn&#39;t tell that she is actually a scheming bitch until it was too late. Her reputation in Nevermore high school is very bad and she was very popular in school in bad ways tho Even though she never did any of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy claimed that she saw her with her own two eyes putting some on chest to make her breast bigger but it was a lie she never did any of that She hated wearing bras like other girls. She would rather leave it natural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know what happened until the next day she went to school and people were throwing things at her, calling her nasty names and almost stripped her to see what she is using on her chest, they threatened her to admit it or they will go to meet the school director and if they go to report her the school director would expel her immediately, she had no choice but to admit it even though she was innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could remember Wendy smirk that day, it was deeply imprinted in her mind. Sherry hated everyone then she never did any of those why didn&#39;t believe but believed Vera instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You lost, Sherry&#34; it was as if she could still hear Wendy&#39;s voice in her head with the victory look in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Stop!&#34; Sherry yelled, when she saw that someone was about to pour a bucket of urine on her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her eyes, gasping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, are you alright?&#34; She heard someone asked besides her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around to look at who it was, It was Tara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine&#34; Sherry reassured her when she saw the worried look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around and saw that everyone was looking at her awkwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave them a smile to apologize to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You scared me, i thought something bad happened to you&#34; Tara tapped her chest to stop her heart which was beating fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, thank you&#34; Sherry said and plugged in her earphones that was what she needed right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara didn&#39;t disturb when she saw her like this, she also started reading novels on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she heard a voice said, from a microphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HELLO LADIES AND GENTLEMAN CAN YOU MOVE TO THE MUSIC HALL ? THE COMPETITION IS ABOUT TO START&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry couldn&#39;t hear because of the earphones in her ears, Tara tapped Sherry on her shoulder and said, &#34;The competition is about to start, we were asked to go to the music hall now&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded when she heard and carried her bag.</p>
