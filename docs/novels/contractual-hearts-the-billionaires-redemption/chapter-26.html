                <p>&#34;Okay! I&#39;m expecting you both&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked out of his office, his Secretary, Clinton walked towards him immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need anything sir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan waved his hand and walked out of his company.. He got into his car and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped his car at Sherry school and called her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in front of your school gate&#34; he said and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry walked out of her school in thirty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the door and sat down beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan started the car and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked out of the window and realized that it was not the direction of his house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we going somewhere?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Grandma said we should come for a meal,&#34; Bryan said without looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry muttered and looked out of the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive was silent but not awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got there in an hour, Bryan packed the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry got down from the car and waited for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan walked towards her after packing the car, they walked into the house together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma was sitting down on the couch with Flow beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma stood up and walked towards them when she saw them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled and walked towards Sherry, she held her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look so skinny, is he bullying you?&#34; Grandma asked Sherry, Sherry stared into her eyes and saw that it was full of heartache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart trembled, she had never heard someone ask her this or look at her with heart ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom was always traveling and didn&#39;t have time for her and her sister before Sherry started working.. Although her mom doesn&#39;t treat her badly, she doesn&#39;t treat her well too..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fortunately, I sent Aunty Edge to your house. Are you trying to starve my granddaughter in law to death?&#34; Grandma scolded Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan: &#34;..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Grandma doesn&#39;t care about him being the legitimate Grandson, he suddenly feels like Sherry is the true granddaughter while he is just the son in law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, he is not bullying me,&#34; Sherry quickly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is not his real wife, so Grandma should not scold him for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma it is my fault&#34; Bryan took a deep breath and admitted his mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked when she heard this but she understood that he was just trying to appease his Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmph!&#34; Grandma harrumph and turned to Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go, the food is ready&#34; Grandma held her hand and led her towards the dining room leaving Bryan standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow bit her lower lips in anger when she was ignored, whenever Sherry arrived she would always be ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to look at Bryan, &#34;Brother Bry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan trailed behind his Grandma not giving Flow a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow clenched her fist tightly, she wanted to leave but she didn&#39;t want to leave without achieving her plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would make sure Sherry and Bryan get divorced today, she was sure once she showed Grandma her trump card she would ask Bryan to divorce her and Bryan would have no choice but to because of Grandma&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph only she can marry Brother Bryan, he belonged to her alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put on a gentle smile and walked towards the dining room Aunty Gladys served the food and they started eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They soon finished eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan received a call from the investigator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go out to receive this call&#34; He said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Grandma waved her hand at him, &#34;You should go&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan: &#34;..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly has a feeling that his Grandma didn&#39;t miss him but Sherry..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up and walked out of the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled when she saw his sullen face like he was abandoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma..&#34; Flow started and bit her lower lips and stared at Sherry like she was hesitating, she continued &#34;I don&#39;t know if i should show this to you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart sank when she saw this, she had a feeling it was about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma said nonchalantly, &#34;What is it?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow took a deep breath and looked at Sherry apologetic, &#34;Grandma i don&#39;t want to show this to you but it is about Sister-in-law&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She handed Grandma the envelope in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma accepted it and opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out some pictures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow looked at Sherry, her eyes gloating like she could already imagined Bryan divorcing Sherry, &#34;i don&#39;t want to show this to you before but it is about brother Bryan, a friend of mine showed this to me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma looked at the picture, her expression changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry&#34; She called in a grave voice and continued, &#34;did you do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She showed the picture to Sherry, it was a picture of Jackson and her, in the cafe the picture looked suggestive like they were kissing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry bit her lips and stared at Grandma, &#34;No&#34; She replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she knew that she would not believe her, they never believed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, i believe you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked up in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow was also shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma smiled at her warmly when she saw the shock in her eyes, &#34;I trust his taste and am sure you won&#39;t do such a thing.. Besides that is what some scheming bitch always does. It happened to me when I married Bryan&#39;s grandfather&#34; Grandma explained and added, &#34;So you have to be careful&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was a little surprised when she heard this, she suddenly felt a little greedy if only this Grandma was her Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her late Grandma also treated her well too but it only lasted for a year before she died.. She has never visited her or seen her before. It was a year before she died that she finally experienced her affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow&#39;s expression turned pale when she heard this, it was not what she expected to happen that her happened.. She clenched her fist tightly and forced out a gentle smile, &#34;That is right, sister-in-law there are a lot of people wanting to become big brother Bryan&#39;s wife so you have to be careful, so you won&#39;t be framed,&#34; Flow advised gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry gave her an indifferent smile, &#34;Thank you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a little puzzled as to how Flow got the picture. She saw Jackson with only Wendy that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Does she know Wendy or what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Bryan picked the call and put the phone on his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have sent the footage to your phone&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his folder and saw that there was a new file there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated on whether to open it or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He decided to open it.</p>
