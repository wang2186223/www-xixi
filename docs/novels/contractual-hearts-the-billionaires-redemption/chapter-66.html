                <p>Sherry snorted, he treated her with indifference when they met when he already liked hmph arrogant man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I have answered your question, shouldn&#39;t you answer mine now?&#34; Bryan arched an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart jumped like it wanted to fly out from her chest, she clenched her fist to calm her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should she confess or not?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t know that even though he told her that he had been in love for ten years she was still scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was feeling tempted to confess that she also had fallen for him but she decided not to after thinking about it. She was afraid he would not believe her and would take her for granted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and exhaled loudly, &#34;Thank you for loving me&#34; She started. Bryan was disappointed when he heard this, she continued when she saw his disappointed face, &#34;But I will learn to love you&#34; She said after much thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded, he was happy at least she didn&#39;t reject him, she would learn to love him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It boosted his Mora and he wants to ensure that she falls in love with him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there is no hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shouldn&#39;t rush things, since she just accepted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay wifey&#34; He smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry heaved a sigh of relief when she saw that his expression brightened, he didn&#39;t look sad and disappointed like when she told him thank you for loving me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay wifey, you have eaten, it is time to take your drugs&#34; Bryan said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s face froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her head and looked at him in shock, he was looking back at her with a big smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then remembered that she already threw the medicine away, on their way home without him knowing. So she was sure he wouldn&#39;t find it where she threw it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a thought occurred to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if he bought another one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry quickly rejected the idea, the name of the medicine is too long even she can&#39;t remember it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he won&#39;t remember what she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart calmed down after thinking about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised an eyebrow when he saw the relief in her face, he smirked at her devilishly, he dipped a hand into his pocket and took out something, Sherry&#39;s eyes followed his movement. She became scared once more when she saw the smirk on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope it is not the medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She prayed it was not the medicine in her heart but her face looked calm even though she was flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan unwrapped the thing in his hand and brought out the medicine, Sherry&#39;s heart sank immediately when she saw the familiar medicine she took in the hospital that day. She was sad and felt very unhappy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t cry because of the medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time to use medicine babe&#34; Bryan said with an innocent smile and added, &#34;I bought this medicine yesterday at the hospital, the previous one was nowhere to be found. Who do you think takes it?&#34; Bryan asked with an innocent face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was feeling guilty when she heard his question and her eyes couldn&#39;t met his eyes that looked like it knew that she took it, she took the medicine from his hand and carried the water on the table, she took the medicine obediently and looked at him with a calm face, &#34;Who knows?&#34; She asked back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Bryan nodded, &#34;You took the medicine obediently, are you feeling guilty?&#34; Bryan arched an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew that she hated medicine and would look for ways to avoid taking it. But she actually took it obediently without being told twice. He knew that she was feeling guilty by the way she behaved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pretended to be angry, &#34;What do you mean? You mean I&#39;ll do something petty like that? I know that the medicine is for my own good so I&#39;ll be sure to take it. Hmph you don&#39;t have to tell before I take my medicine&#34; Sherry snorted and looked away from his eyes that were searching her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded, &#34;Okay I know that my baby is not petty, She is very obedient&#34; Bryan coaxed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat down next to her and wrapped his hand around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry snorted, &#34;Hmph, Good for you&#34; She said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe, today is my birthday,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, happy birthday hubby&#34; Sherry said and pecked his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at her with his eyebrow raised, &#34;That&#39;s all?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Sherry looked at him dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want a gift&#34; He said like a spoiled child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay I&#39;ll get you one later&#34; She said, she doesn&#39;t know what to give him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has given her ex different kinds of birthday gifts, shoes, trousers, shirt etc with her hardened money but she got nothing in return on her birthday. Not even a happy birthday. She was always the one giving the gifts, it looked like she was dating herself not a man. She doesn&#39;t know what to give him though, she wants it to be special and it should not be a regular gift she gave her ex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want it now,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was unhappy that she didn&#39;t know that today was his birthday, he knew hers because he checked her Id card. He still remembered he never forgot her birthday. But she didn&#39;t remember him, she didn&#39;t even know that it was his birthday today, he wants her to give him a gift now so she won&#39;t tell him that she forgot later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the gift she will give him, he could buy it himself but he still wants a gift from her, that she gave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sighed, &#34;But I can&#39;t go out you know because of the reporters&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to worry about that, I&#39;ll solve that&#34; Bryan reassured her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay fine, I&#39;ll go&#34; She stood up from the couch, she looked at her clothes and felt that she didn&#39;t need to change it. It was casual clothes but it is still presentable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan stood up too, &#34;I&#39;ll follow you&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shrugged and nodded, &#34;Okay let&#39;s go&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan held her hand and they walked out of the house hand in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan opened the car door for her, he closed the car gently after Sherry got In.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked to the other side and got into the car, he started the car and drove out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They drove out of the gate, there was no sign of reporters anywhere. Sherry sighed in relief and looked at him, &#34;Did you do it?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked ahead and asked, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The reporters are nowhere to be found, did you do that?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan shook his head, &#34;No&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was confused when she heard his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the mirror and saw an unfamiliar car following them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly told Bryan, &#34;That car has been following us since we drove out of the house&#34; She said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded, &#34;Yes, they are our bodyguards&#34; He replied to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded in understanding when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked out of the window and saw a mall, so she asked him to stop there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan listened to her obediently and parked the car in the mall, Sherry opened the car door and got out of the car without waiting for him to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked back and saw that the car also stopped and two men walked out of the car. Bryan got out of the car and walked towards them. He whispered some things to them before walking towards Sherry&#39;s back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will they follow us in?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t want people to look at them like they were weird. People would probably think she was the one who asked Bryan to call the bodyguards, because it has been a while since he used the bodyguards. Most people don&#39;t know he has bodyguards too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would probably blame her, but she doesn&#39;t care about that. She never cared about what others said about her. It doesn&#39;t affect her, it is fine as long as it won&#39;t affect her source of income. It is not like they were the one feeding her or taking care of her. If they were the one taking care of her fine she would care but they never take care of her, so why should she care. Gossiping about her won&#39;t feed her stomach nor will it feed theirs.</p>
