                <p>Sherry heaved a sigh of relief when she heard this, fortunately, Steven helped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you&#34; She thanked him sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about you thank me with a kiss?&#34; Bryan said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed, she tiptoed and kissed him on the lips briefly, it was a short kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was shocked, he was actually just teasing her, because she has not been in a good mood since they left the hospital and this was the first time she took the initiative and kissed him, he was really happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was grinning from ear to ear and looked happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was not sure of what was wrong with him, he was grinning from ear to ear like there was a happy occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked back to the room, after a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed and lay down on the bed and fell asleep without knowing, Bryan was in the study room busy, he left some important work this afternoon after he called her so he had to finish some things tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring ! Ring !</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked it up from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Conerlius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered the call and put the phone on his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,&#34; Bryan answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already gave police the evidence of her phone call, police arrested her but she said her phone was stolen since yesterday and she had not used it to call&#34; Cornelius said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed, &#34;I can know why she is fearless, tsk tsk&#34; Conerlius said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan&#39;s face turned cold, &#34;Where is she now?&#34; He asked in a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The police released her since the evidence was not solid enough &#34; Cornelius said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan hung up on him after hearing this, feeling angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took his phone and scrolled through the numbers, he finally found the number he was looking, he send a text message, &#34;Come out of your house, I&#39;m outside&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked out of the house quietly, after sending this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow walked into her house with a triumphant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just coming back from the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sent a woman to attack Sherry today with reporters, she wants the video online. But her rationality has eaten her brain up or her rage blinded her eyes, so she used her cell phone and sim card to call the woman. By the time she realized what happened it was too late, she could only throw her phone away destroying the evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t expect her fears to actually happen, the police came to arrest her, she quickly lied that her phone was stolen since yesterday so she was not the one who made the call. The police released her because there was not sufficient evidence pointing that she was guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was angry and happy at the same time, the reason she was angry was because she already told the woman to do it quickly and not be caught but she actually overdo it and got caught by Bryan. Good for her. She doesn&#39;t care whether she survives or not. The reason she was happy was because of the way the police took the case seriously. It showed that Sherry was seriously injured besides she heard one of the police say that Sherry was still at the hospital. She smiles happily gloating at her misfortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not sure if the woman successfully destroyed her face or not, she wished she could go there herself to see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to wear her pajamas when her phone &#39;Beep&#39; the notification of a new message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the message and was shocked to the core when she saw the sender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Brother Bryan&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;can you come out of your house, I&#39;m outside &#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow sat up on the bed immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly put on some makeup on her face, Sherry&#39;s face would probably be as swollen as a pig by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe when Brother Bryan sees her face, he would fall for her instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at herself in the mirror and was satisfied when she saw the way she looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put on seductive clothes, she walked out of the house and stood in front of her gate, Bryan was not there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow was not about to give up completely, so she stood outside determined to wait for him, even though she was feeling cold because it was winter time already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan sat down inside his car not far away from Flow, he was looking at her while smoking. He watched her wait outside for hours waiting for him with an expressionless face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was amused when he saw how determined she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clothes she was wearing were exposed, and it would make her catch cold faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t care and just watched for two hours and thirty minutes before he finally started the car and drove towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked out of the car, Flow has been squatting down since because her legs were aching, she immediately stood up when she saw Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother Bryan&#34; She called in a soft tone, her voice also trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems you don&#39;t know your limit and dared to arm my wife&#34; Bryan looked at her with a ruthless smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow&#39;s gentle smile froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he still suspect even after the police released her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked Bryan with an innocent face, &#34;Why don&#39;t I understand what you&#39;re talking about? I don&#39;t understand&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would know if there is no evidence!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan arched an eyebrow, he already expected her to deny it so he was not surprised, &#34;I don&#39;t care about you denying it or not but I&#39;ll warm you for the last time, if you do anything that would harm my wife, Don&#39;t blame me if I stopped giving your family face&#34; Bryan warned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reason he was not willing to do anything to Flow was because of the close relationship they had with his family, he would warn her and give her a second chance if she still dared to arm Sherry, he wouldn&#39;t care about how close his families were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow trembled in shock when she saw the ruthlessness in his face, she shivered both because of his gaze and the cold. &#34;Brother Bryan&#34; she tried to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan didn&#39;t give her the chance to get near him before he got into the car and drove away leaving her on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow trembled, she fell down on the floor with a pale face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought it was because he got tired of Sherry &#39;s face that made her happy. She specially dressed up for him, who knew that he would be so late that she had to wait for him for hours before he finally came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t blame Bryan but blamed Sherry instead, it must be her fault that was why Bryan came late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he came he didn&#39;t even glance at her or care about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He actually berated her because of that bitch?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn she was feeling angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sneezed twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understands at once that she already caught a cold. She didn&#39;t blame Bryan and blamed Sherry, she was the one who caused it.</p>
