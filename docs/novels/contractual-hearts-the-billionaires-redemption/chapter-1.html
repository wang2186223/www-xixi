                <p>Sherry Hue, a genius stock trader drowning in family debts, signs a 90-day marriage contract with enigmatic billionaire Bryan Ruger—$100,000 weekly for playing his devoted wife. But their icy arrangement ignites when Bryan discovers she’s the scarred girl who saved his life years ago. As Sherry battles gold-digging relatives, jealous heiresses, and her own traumatic past, Bryan’s calculated world unravels. Caught between a fake marriage and real desire, they must confront secrets that could destroy them... or rewrite fate. In a world of lies, can a contract forged in gold become a vow of the heart?</p>

He was shocked by the way she appeared; she had snow-white skin, an oval face, attractive eyebrows, and a pair of soft red lips that were bright red like cherries, but her eyes appeared to be ready to turn into a gun and kill people; they also appeared cold, ruthless, and emotionless, as though she was incapable of feeling any emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his eyes caught hers, the young man shivered unconsciously. He clenched his fist to control his feelings and forced a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Mr. Bryan&#39;s secretary,&#34; Clinton said in his introduction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34;. She murmured while gazing solely at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Clinton knows Sherry won&#39;t be inviting him to a seat, he has no choice but to sit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope Miss Sherry doesn&#39;t mind, my Boss is busy so he doesn&#39;t have time to come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She talks as if she would die if she talked too much, therefore it seems like his boss has found his counterpart, Clinton shook his head inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed a document from the brown package in his hand and got right to the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can review the contract to see if there are any provisions with which you disagree&#34;. He extended his hand to her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took the paper and began carefully reading the contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clinton made excellent use of the chance to thoroughly scrutinize her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had neatly styled hair and was dressed in a long white skirt. She had a stunning, regal, and commanding appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pen?&#34; After reading the contract, she looked up from the paper and fixed her gaze on Clinton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clinton made a foolish remark, &#34;Ah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finished reading it that quickly, he thought, staring at her in astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he realized how foolish he appeared, he collected himself, reached into his pocket, pulled out a pen, and handed it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took the pen, wrote her name on the paper, and then returned the paper to Clinton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clinton placed the paper into the envelope before rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His work is finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like a ride?&#34; Clinton offered because, if his boss had arrived, he would have dropped her off, wouldn&#39;t he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t look at him as she kept fiddling with her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clinton gave a quick nod before leaving the café.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry drank all of her coffee before getting up and leaving the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed as she turned to face the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another contract was inked. She smiled a little, but if you didn&#39;t look closely, you wouldn&#39;t see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was in a good mood because she was contemplating the money she would make from this completed deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flagged down a cab and climbed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She informed the driver, &#34;Shalon street.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;$30&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t respond to what the driver said; instead, she just stared out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone abruptly rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled her phone from her bag, she sighed when she saw the caller,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her big sis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the phone ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before it eventually stopped ringing, the phone continued to ring for a few more rings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced out and realized that they had arrived at her house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got out of the car after paying the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dipped her hand into the purse in her and pull her a set of keys</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inserted the keys on the doorknob and entered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She entered the dining room, set her bag on the couch, poured herself a glass of water, and drank every last drop because she was a little thirsty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down on the couch and turn on the television</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Ringg&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She received a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled her phone out of her backpack, She quickly checked the display-it was an unfamiliar number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t pick it up, just left it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It rang once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her sister again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a sigh before pressing the response key.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed it on her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, am I speaking Miss Nancy&#39;s sister?&#34;. a girl asked on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked in surprise when she heard an unfamiliar voice &#34;Who is this?&#34;. Sherry questioned in a cold voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you please come to Vegas Street? Your sister is in difficulty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beep, beep,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for her response, She hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevada Street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry got out of the vehicle, after paying the cab. She immediately saw her sister waving at her when she looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed that the place was full of crowds, so she scowled a little. She despises staying in a place that is excessively noisy and crowded. But despite that, she continued to move in the direction of her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my sister, and she&#39;ll pay you&#34;. Sherry heard Nancy say immediately she got there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry frowned a little when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope it is not what she is thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people who surrounded Nancy suddenly focused their gaze on her, making her feel a little uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34;Sherry asked Nancy while giving her a chilly look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I owe her a few dollars, so hurry up and pay her&#34;, Nancy remarked without feeling remorseful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blinked in realization when she heard this, this is exactly what came into her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this wasn&#39;t the first time this has happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she your sister?&#34; Sherry heard a voice asked behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry turned her head to look at the person who asked, it was a young girl &#34;Yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your sister owes me $50,000 and has been avoiding me for the past month; she has not paid. She made a $5000 interest payment guarantee to me when she took out the loan. So I gave my consent. In addition, she appeared to be a respectable person and constantly treated me with contempt. I gave her the cash that day for that reason. Who knows, maybe she&#39;ll end up being a cold-hearted person&#34;. The girl explained everything that happened immediately when she heard her affirmation, &#34;tsk tsk the both of you are so well dressed but people won&#39;t know you are actually a debtors&#34;. Sherry overheard the girl say this in a low voice.</p>
