                <p>Bryan smiled when he saw her close the bathroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed and walked out of her roomyesterday when he was about to walk out of her room, she suddenly started crying in her sleep. He quickly consoled when he saw that she had calmed down. He tried to leave but she held her hand and refused to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he had no choice but to stay in her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she walked out of the bathroom, she didn&#39;t see him in her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly changed her clothes, she didn&#39;t have classes today..and she doesn&#39;t have any friends so she could only work and make some money instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out her laptop and started workingshe lost track of time and she even forgot that she hasn&#39;t even eaten breakfast yet..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the time, and realized that it was 1 pm already. She stretched her tired body, her body was aching because she has been sleeping in one position for six hours now. Her stomach growled noisily, reminding her that she hasn&#39;t fed herself today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t eat dinner last night either. She took her phone and ordered a takeout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After eating lunch, she stood up and walked out of her roomshe is tired from looking at her laptop screen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the house, she didn&#39;t see Bryan so she guessed that he had gone to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to stroll around aimlessly, she saw a mall and entered the mall to see if she would need anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around and didn&#39;t see anything she was interested in, her stomach was feeling uncomfortable so she walked into the ladies room in the mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the ladies room, after finishing her business. She walked out, she was about to walk out of the mall when she saw a familiar face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Emma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her friend from high school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the only friend she had in high school, after she was framed and stepped on by the people she called her friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only him who stood by her side, she never Treated him as a friend in the first place, she thought only the friends who betrayed her in the end were the only ones who treated her wellbut at the end of the day she realized that they were just fake friends..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She owed Emma big time, that was why she avoided him; she felt that she didn&#39;t deserve to be his friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about twenty years old, wearing rimless glass. His skin was fair and nose was straight, he smiled at her warmly, &#34;Hi, Ery&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard him say, she raised her head and looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the only one who ever called her Ery, She bit her lower lips, she has changed a lot but he still recognized her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I know you?&#34; She pretended not to recognize him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He faked a hurt face, &#34;You have forgotten about me? I&#39;m Emma from Nevermore high school&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Emma, how did you recognize me?&#34; She asked curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was trying to avoid him by pretending not to know him, but she decided not to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;, I&#39;ll recognize you even if you become 50 years old,&#34; Emma replied with a smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about we grab some food?&#34; Emma asked with a smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was bored anyway and was looking for ways to kill time so she followed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sat down inside a restaurant, Emma called a waiter and handed the menu to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ordered some things, Emma also ordered beer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started chatting. Now it is more like Emma doing the talking while Sherry will nod sometimes or say something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have changed a lot, Sherry,&#34; Emma suddenly says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry forced out a chuckle, &#34;Everyone changes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma shook his head, &#34;No you were never like this&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled without replying, she didn&#39;t know what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up from her seat, &#34;I&#39;ll be leaving first&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give you a ride it is late now&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay i can take a taxi&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;ll drop you off&#34; Emma insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry checked the time and found that it was about 9 o&#39;clock, it was not too late but it will be difficult to get a taxi at this hour. She nodded, &#34;Okay, thank you in advance&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked out of the restaurant together, immediately they walked out of the restaurant she saw Bryan with that woman she saw in his Grandma&#39;s place, Flow walked out of the restaurant also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were talking and laughing, it is more like Flow doing the talking and laughing at her joke the man beside her just had an indifference expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry glanced at them briefly like she doesn&#39;t know them, Emma opened the door for Sherry like a gentleman. However, before Sherry went inside she heard Flow called her name from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Sherry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked over with a frown on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, it is really you,&#34; Flow exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was also looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow looked at Bryan expecting him to do something, no man would stand aside and watch their wife enter another man&#39;s car right? She looked at Sherry looking like she was about to watch a show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Flow,&#34; Sherry said indifferently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are going home?&#34; Bryan asked calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow expression changed when she heard this, is he not supposed to be angry if his wife is about to enter another man&#39;s car?</p>
