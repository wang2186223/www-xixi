                <p>She thought it was because he got tired of Sherry &#39;s face that made her happy. She specially dressed up for him, who knew that he would be so late that she had to wait for him for hours before he finally came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t blame Bryan but blamed Sherry instead, it must be her fault that was why Bryan came late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he came he didn&#39;t even glance at her or care about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He actually berated her because of that bitch?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn she was feeling angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sneezed twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understands at once that she already caught a cold. She didn&#39;t blame Bryan and blamed Sherry, she was the one who caused it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into her house, feeling angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry opened her eyes, she quickly closed it back because the room window was opened, so the light of the sun made her go blind when she opened her eyes. She tried to open it later, she looked around and nobody was inside the room. She sighed and stood up from the bed. She stood in front of the mirror, she saw that her face was now back to normal. The swell has also reduced a lot too. She guessed it was Bryan&#39;s handiwork because she remembered that she didn&#39;t use anything on her face when she was about to sleep. She was too tired to remember anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And her body was aching badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would remember this debt, and make Flow pay double.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the bathroom to take a shower. She wore casual clothes Since she can&#39;t go out so she won&#39;t be able to go to school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry walked out of the room, she took an elevator to the living room. She walked into the living room, no one was there. She walked towards the kitchen and saw him as she expected to cook with chef clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked hilarious but he looked handsome in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure he would look handsome no matter what he wears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood there and looked at him for a while. She felt that the scene looked beautiful and cool, so she took out her phone and snapped at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the picture and smiled in satisfaction. She was not good at taking pictures but she looked handsome from every angle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hid the picture where no one could find it with a password.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never taken a picture with a man before, and no man ever snapped her and used her as wallpaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also longed for that, but her wishes never came true. She wants to be pampered, cared for and loved. Bryan showed her everything but instead of feeling satisfied, she was not instead she was afraid. That everything is just a dream and she will wake up soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized that she has fallen for him, but will his affection last long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry?&#34; Bryan called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry snapped out of her thought and looked at him, &#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The food is ready&#34; He smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded, &#34;I&#39;ll help you to serve the food&#34; She said and started walking towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan stopped her, &#34;No you don&#39;t have to, just go and wait for me to bring the food to you. Our baby might be in your stomach, don&#39;t stress yourself&#34; Bryan smiled slyly at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry chuckled when she heard what he said, &#34;Baby? No baby here, it is my monthly visitor here&#34; Sherry blinked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sorry to burst his bubble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it doesn&#39;t matter, just learn to be lazy so you won&#39;t stress yourself when you are pregnant&#34; Bryan said in a nonchalant tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not disappointed that she was not pregnant, there is still time, he would mold a baby and put it into her stomach soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded and didn&#39;t insist about helping him, she walked to the dining room and sat down. She took out her phone to browse the internet so she won&#39;t feel bored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beep!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A message came into her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Tara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara: Yo babe!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry: Good, what about you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara: I&#39;m good, are you enjoying your holiday?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry:( She sent a bored emoji), bored as hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara: (Send a laughing emoji) You don&#39;t have a choice, you have to except if you wish to get harassed by those aggressive reporters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened yesterday was not uploaded online because Bryan destroyed those reporters&#39; cameras and sued their company, some went bankrupt in an hour. They don&#39;t even have a chance to save their heads not to talk of uploading it, so only a few people know about it. Even Tara was not aware, if she knew she would have come to visit Sherry and made sure those reporters got jailed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry: Yes I know madam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara: Babe, you would be a godmother soon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry: ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t understand where a baby is coming from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara: I&#39;m really pregnant, it has been confirmed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry: For real ( Sends a disbelieve emoji)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara: Yeah, so you would be a godmother soon, are you happy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry: Do you wish to keep it? You won&#39;t tell the baby&#39;s father?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara: I want to keep it, my mom has been asking for a grandson for two years now. I don&#39;t know who is so daft and lied to my mom that I was a lesbian she has been demanding a baby since then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry: (Sends a wow emoji) you are lesbian? (Sends a shocked emoji), Wow. I can&#39;t believe I have a lesbian friend ( sends a thinking emoji) are you perhaps attracted to me? That was why you became my friend? Note I&#39;m not a lesbian, I&#39;m straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara: F*ck I&#39;m not a lesbian, yuck that is disgusting, I don&#39;t like it. I&#39;m straight!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry: I don&#39;t believe it! (Sends a disbelieve emoji)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara: Damn you Sherry!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It has been a while since she had a good time with someone she can call a friend. It actually feels good if the friend is real, not those hypocrites and backstabbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your friend is a lesbian?&#34; A voice asked behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked and almost jumped up from her seat because she was not expecting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You why can&#39;t you make a sound while walking?&#34; Sherry asked after calming down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at her with a nonchalant look, &#34;Why should I? It is not like you have anything to hide&#34; Bryan said and asked, &#34;Your friend is a lesbian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; Sherry spat and she quickly changed the subject and ordered him, &#34;Quick serve the food, I&#39;m hungry&#34; She said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan chuckled, not minding her tone, &#34;At your service my queen&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry flushed red, she tried to keep a straight face even those she was flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Queen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounds cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan served the food and they started eating quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They finished eating in a few minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan cleared the plates and washed it, Sherry wanted to help him but he didn&#39;t allow her to, he insisted that she should not bother that he will do everything himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finished washing the dishes and walked into the living room, he saw her sitting down at the couch leaning down. He walked towards her and sat down next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember what day it is today?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him puzzled, &#34;What day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was hurt a little when he saw her confused expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Does she ever love him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked her , &#34;Do you ever love or like me?&#34; Bryan asked with a serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was nervous of what her answer will be, what if she says no?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doesn&#39;t want it to be like he was just forcing himself on her, he also wants her to be a willing partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry became a little nervous when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already believed that love was dead and it is something that doesn&#39;t exist even though she felt it thrice with three jerks making her miserable and made her give up on love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really doesn&#39;t believe it exists, because after the first trial till the third she keeps getting hurt in the end. Until he barges into her life again making her fall for him hopelessly after giving up on love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really doesn&#39;t want to answer his question, she is really scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she confesses and he took her for granted, or he was just being obsessed with her for the moment which would end soon, what should she do then?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she would be left heartbroken and hopeless again, no?</p>
