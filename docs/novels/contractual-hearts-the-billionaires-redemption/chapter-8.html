                <p>She worked for an hour and thirty minutes, she didn&#39;t dare to sleep late so she wouldn&#39;t wake up late because she knew that she was going to meet Bryan&#39;s Grandma tomorrow so she had to sleep early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked the time on her phone to check the timeit was 11pm already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yawned tiredly and turned off the light, she covered her body with the blanket and dozed off..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry woke up early today because she remembered that Bryan told her that they were going to visit his grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put on some makeup after dressing up. She checked her appearance in the mirror. She was what people would call stunningly beautiful. She had snow white skin, an oval face, pretty eyebrows and a set of soft lips that were bright red like cherries. Her bright eyes were cold and lifeless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore a white long skirt, with long flaxen hair resting on her back. With a big chest and a firm butt, her body was a graceful curve representing an S-shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly dabbed a bit of powder on her face then she applied a new coat of pink lipstick on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She always liked to be indoor but since this is inevitable she had to go since she already signed a contract with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurriedly picked up a pair of black stiletto from her closet. She put it on and walked out of her room after dealing with her cat food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked down the stairs step by step, Bryan was already sitting down in the living room waiting for her. Surprise flashed in his eyes when he saw her appearance but it flashed and disappeared quickly that no one would  notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go&#34; Bryan stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked out of the room together, Bryan opened the driver seat and got in. Sherry opened the passenger seat and sat down by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry took a deep breath and prepared herself to face Bryan&#39;s family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours later, a Mercedes Benz drove out of the town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car drove into a street more like an estate. Sherry started seeing big houses, there are no small houses in the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The houses there would cost tens of billions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car moved and passed the big houses for nearly an hour before finally stopping at the Erik residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Sherry got out of the car, she saw a very luxurious house. It was a three storied building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>High hall and elegant door, round arched Windows and cornerstones. It looked more beautiful than Bryan villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by beautiful flowers and the shadow of an artificial mountain under the willow tree not far away, Sherry could see the green mountains and water in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stream that was flowing down from the peak of the mountain had formed a different kind of scenery in this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house looks like a little palace for a royal family. It contained an effective window system for good ventilation. The house is equipped with modern appliances and air-conditioning for comfort and convenience. Trees and flowers was  planted around it for decoration and to make it look beautiful</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan got down from the car and walked towards, he put his hand on her slender waist. He felt that his hand was just made for her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know we must do this, right?&#34; Bryan whispered in her ears, blowing his hot breath on her neck, he stared at her neck to see if she would blush or be shy but her expression was still the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Boring&#39; Bryan rolled his eyes when she saw her indifferent eyes, he started doubting if she actually liked a man or woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I know&#34; Sherry answered, trying to calm her heart that was beating, accelerating like she would have a heart attack soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Damn! This man is trying to seduce me but i won&#39;t fall for his honeytrap&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that he did it purposely but she decided not to say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her in through the door of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Bryan opened the door, Sherry could smell the fragrance coming inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was lunch time and there seemed to be a servant preparing a sumptuous lunch. The glazed light shone on Sherry&#39;s face and she was dragged slowly by Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was composed and not nervous because it is just a contract marriage, she doesn&#39;t need to please his grandma and besides this is not the first time she is meeting someone grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has met like five grandmas now from the other contract marriage she signed so she was used to it.</p>
