                <p>He raised an eyebrow and asked, &#34;What monthly visitor?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry bit her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she expecting him to understand the meaning of monthly visitor, he was a guy for heck sake, Sherry&#39; She yelled in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked down and said with a blush, &#34;My monthly flow is here, so can you help me get that?&#34; She asked in a tiny voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took Bryan ten seconds to get what she was trying to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, &#34;Okay I&#39;ll ask Clinton to get it?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doesn&#39;t want her to get the wrong idea, he can go and get it himself if she wants him to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded, &#34;That is fine, thank you&#34; she closed the bathroom door after saying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan took out his phone from his pocket and called Clinton instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt her stomach hurting, she is having menstrual cramps as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she always has it every month, she is still not used to the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lips to stop herself from groaning in pain, so Bryan won&#39;t be worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t endure the pain and moaned in pain lightly but Bryan heard her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright Sherry?&#34; Bryan asked, outside the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry tried to speak normally so he wouldn&#39;t notice anything, &#34;I&#39;m fine, i&#34; she didn&#39;t finish her words before she blacked out and fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise was heard by Bryan who was waiting for her outside. He opened the bathroom door immediately without speaking, he was shocked to see Sherry lying on the floor unconscious. He walked into the bathroom and squatted down, &#34;Sherry?&#34; He called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body most especially her forehead was covered with sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isn&#39;t it just menstruation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did she fall unconscious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan quickly took Sherry in his arms and took her to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the emergency room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor walked out of the emergency, Bryan was pacing to and from outside the emergency room, he quickly approached the door once he came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is she?&#34; Bryan asked instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is your relationship to the patient?&#34; The doctor asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m her husband,&#34; Bryan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is fine, it seems she liked eating too much of cold foods and all sorts of sweet things which caused this, why can&#39;t you be careful and you are her husband?&#34; The doctor asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan bit his lower lips and didn&#39;t reply to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t eat cold foods in front of him or he has never seen her eating cold or sweet things before but he didn&#39;t tell the doctor this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor shook his head, wrote a prescription and said nagging, &#34;Monitor her so she would stop eating cold foods or sweet things, it is bad for her health and she would have difficulties of getting pregnant if care is not taken&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor handed him the prescription he wrote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Buy this drugs for her, make sure she use it regularly so she would become healthy and her cramps would also not be like this and she is still unconscious now, you can call the nurse to change her clothes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan accepted it and went to get everything inside the prescription.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also bought tampons, clothes since the one she wore is stained with blood and new panties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked into the ward Sherry was in, she was still unconscious as the doctor said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried her in his arms and walked into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could easily ask a nurse to do it but he wants to do it himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He changed her clothes and everything, he walked out of the bathroom and lay her down on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat down beside the bed waiting for her to wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her eyes thirty minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around and saw that she was at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why does she always end up in the hospital these days?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn she has never been to the hospital before because of her phobia for medicine and drips but it was when she met Bryan, she has visited the hospital four times now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was afraid of going to hospital and she was scared of those nurses and doctors, so even when she was very sick she would put a blanket on her head and lay down there till she got better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They can&#39;t even afford money to eat so how would they afford the hospital bills, Whenever she was sick before when her family was still together, her parents would always buy drugs for her, she would pretend like she had take it but she would put it under the couch, she was caught one day that day her mom wants to clean the whole house, so she opened the whole couch to sweep the sands under the couch, then boom they would see different types and sizes of drugs under the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew She was the one immediately because Nancy loves taking medicine or drips. She even loves injections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She always looks at her with disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tch! She doesn&#39;t understand why she would always be happy that she wants to take drugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After seeing that she always hid the drugs under the couch, they would always monitor her whenever she was taking drugs, so she decided to start flushing it in the sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So everytime after taking drugs, she would always go to the bathroom to flush it away and she has never been caught. Before her dad ran away with their savings with his mistress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, after he ran away. He didn&#39;t want us to have a place to stay, so he called the owner of the house and told him that he already left the house with his belongings and it remained her mom and two children and he was not sure that her mom has any money to pay for the house so he should send us out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes she always wondered if he was her real father, because no father would ever do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They roamed about three years with no house to stay. Her mom&#39;s friends also left her when she encountered a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reason she believed that everyone is a hypocrite was based on her experience.</p>
