                <p>She ate dinner outside before going back home because Bryan doesn&#39;t have a housekeeper to cook, when she got home Bryan was not home yet.  She walked into her room directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lay down on the bed to sleep but she couldn&#39;t sleep when she finally slept.she woke up at midnight because of a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the nightmare that had haunted her for three years now. The reason why she always slept very late was because of the nightmare, if her body was very tired and needed sleep she wouldn&#39;t have the nightmare and that is sometimes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly realized something, when she and Bryan slept together in his Grandma&#39;s she didn&#39;t have the nightmare. She also remembered that the first day she moved into his place, she was not sure if she had the nightmare or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t confirm her suspicion because she couldn&#39;t just walk to Bryan and ask him to sleep with her to test if she will have a nightmare or not, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up and walked out of her room, she was afraid of sleeping againshe doesn&#39;t want to remember what she is desperately trying to forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed the door silently and walked towards the balcony. She sat down on the stool there and just looked at her surroundings but her heart was still heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dipped her hand into the coat she wore, she took out a pack of her cigarettes and lit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not a heavy smoker and she smokes except when she is feeling a little down like this, she smokes to relieve her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued smokingshe slowly lost track of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lit the sixth cigarette when she heard a voice ask behind her &#34;You can&#39;t sleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was startled because she didn&#39;t hear his footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at him briefly.. He was wearing his robe and he looked a little sexy..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away from him, &#34;en&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke after this, She finished smoking and walked past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night&#34; she said in a low tone and walked into her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was feeling very weak and tired..so she lay down on the bed, she fell asleep quickly as she predicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She woke up early, she only slept for an hour and thirty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a shower, wore her clothes and walked out of her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she got to the living room, Bryan was not thereshe guessed maybe he was still sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the house and hailed a cab to school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The class was so smooth because Vera was absent from school so there was no one to bother her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After class, she was about to walk out of the class when a girl stopped. The girl looked beautiful and cute but she put on a glass which was hiding her beauty, Sherry was sure the girl would be more beautiful without a glass on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, I&#39;m Tara&#34; the girl introduced herself shyly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded in acknowledgement not saying anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara was not embarrassed when she saw this, &#34;can we be friends?&#34; Tara asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pursed her lower lip, &#34;No&#34; She replied and walked out of the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes people think she is proud, but she was not and she doesn&#39;t feel like she had the obligation to explain anything to them, she also tried to have friends when she was young but all she got was betrayals and she was framed a lot by themso she gave up and decided not have friends anymore and just be alone because she hates conflict too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the school and was about to hail a cab when a Rolls Royce stopped in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She furrowed her brows, a little annoyed she was about to walk away when the passenger window opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why is he here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard him say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She complied and opened the car door, she got in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down beside him, she looked out of the window feeling a little bored..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes grew heavy and she felt a little sleepy because she didn&#39;t sleep well today but she doesn&#39;t want to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was settling a few emails on his laptop. He suddenly felt something heavy on his shoulder, got turned and looked at his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw that it was Sherry, her eyes were closed..it seems she fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t wake up because he knew that she didn&#39;t sleep well last night for some reason he didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his head and said to Calvin who was driving, &#34;Drive a little slower&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Boss&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan closed his laptop and put it aside and gently reached out to shift the girl who was still sleeping from his shoulder so her head wouldn&#39;t hurt later when she woke up..he decided to place her head on his lap instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then covered her body securely with his suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car drove into his house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently carried her out of the car in bridal style, he carried her into her room, and laid her down on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was very sound asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even wake up when Bryan carried her into the bedroom and placed her on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked petite and vulnerable on the soft bed. Her long hair covered half her face. She looked innocent and adorable unlike the way she usually looked, which was indifferent and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan sat down by the bed, he stroked her soft face. He watched her peaceful expression, his eyes landed on her lips which looked soft so that he would love to take a bite again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He planted a soft kiss on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wasn&#39;t normal, he felt like he should taste all of her again. He wants to see if her lips will be sweet like when he kissed them in his Grandma&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his rationality told him not to and the dark circles on her face stopped him too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up and left her room quickly before he lose control and deepen the kiss</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the next day, Sherry finally woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she opened her eyes, the first person she saw was Bryan who was sitting down by the bed looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell into a daze for a few seconds when she saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is he doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly remembered that he came to pick her up from school yesterday eveningit seems she fell asleep in his car right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning&#34; She heard his sexy voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning,&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to stand up, she looked at her body and realized that the clothes she was putting on was different from the one she wore yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked her eyes in surprise but the clothes were still on her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her head and looked at him with questions in her eyes. She blushed and asked &#34;These clothes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I changed it for you&#34; he said nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face flushed and she opened her mouth in shock &#34;You&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow and asked &#34;What about me? What is there that I have not seen before ? Didn&#39;t i also change your clothes for you at Grandma&#39;s place?&#34; He smiled teasingly.. &#34;Besides the front is very small so i don&#39;t have interest in it&#34; he smirked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a hooligan!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He is bullying me!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is not small at all, it is a B cup!!&#34; She tried to defend her breast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh but it looks small when i was changing your clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry &#34;..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn she doesn&#39;t want to talk to this shameless man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up from the bed and walked into the bathroom, she closed the door with a &#39;bang&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rested her body on the door and put a hand on her chest, her heart was beating so fast in front of him she didn&#39;t want him to know that was why she left quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled when he saw her close the bathroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed and walked out of her roomyesterday when he was about to walk out of her room, she suddenly started crying in her sleep. He quickly consoled when he saw that she had calmed down. He tried to leave but she held her hand and refused to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he had no choice but to stay in her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only</p>
