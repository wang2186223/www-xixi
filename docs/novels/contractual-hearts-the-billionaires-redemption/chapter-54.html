                <p>She really slept with a guy she didn&#39;t know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he an escort?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still thinking about this, when the sound of water in the bathroom stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara hopped off the bed, she put on her clothes at speed and carried her handbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out one of her cards and scribbled something inside a paper and put it on the bed, then she put the card on the paper so it wouldn&#39;t fly away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it was a win to win deal, she didn&#39;t want to take advantage of the escort so she paid him for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard walked out of the bathroom and watched her leave without stopping her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a one night stand anyway so there is no need for him to take it personal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, he was planning to marry Sherry before, but Cornelius called him when he was still away and told him &#39;Bad news&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About Bryan and Sherry&#39;s marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew her first and he fell for her first. Besides, he was the one who introduced her to Bryan when he told him about his Grandma urging him to get married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to marry her after she finished her contract with Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not sure of what method Bryan used that made her agree to marry but he was sure it was not because of money. He had also offered a lot of money before just for her to marry him but she said &#39;no&#39; because she doesn&#39;t want to depend on a man to live and wants to make her own money herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had not seen her since the day he committed that mistake, he was afraid of facing her hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even know that he was the one who told Bryan about her and that was why he approached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was because of the mistake, he didn&#39;t show up in front of her so she could forgive him slowly and she would have made a huge amount of money after fulfilling her contract, then he would approach her again and propose to her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who knows that Bryan would snatch her away from him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Married!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard clenched his fist tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wants to show up in front of Sherry and asks her if Bryan forced her to marry him. If he forced her to, he would elope with her or better still he would make her escape Bryan&#39;s clutches but if she was willing he would wait for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how long it takes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put on his clothes and took his wrist watch from the bed. He was about to walk out of the room when his eyes fell on a card on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took it, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was sure it was not his card so it can only belong to the lady he spent the night with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she forgot it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes fell on a white paper on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked it curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The handwriting was beautiful but the words written inside were infuriating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Hi handsome hunk, i guess you are probably an escort so i decided to thank you for spending a night with me, that card contains three million dollars I&#39;m sure no client has ever paid you that much because you are very bad in bed hehe no need to thank me, the pin 1234 byeee&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard crushed the paper in his hand feeling angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He is bad in bed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was his first time!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara hailed a cab to her house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paid the taxi and walked into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the door and walked into the living room watching a show on the huge television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was so beautiful it looked like a palace and it was more beautiful than a palace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom, Angelina turned her head from the television and looked at Tara, &#34;You are back? Why didn&#39;t you come home last night? Were you with my son-in-law?&#34; Angelina asked with her brow raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara pursues her lips unhappily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even let her rest before asking her questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, there is no son-in-law anywhere&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angelina was stunned, &#34;Didn&#39;t you tell me you will bring my son-in-law back today, where is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he rejected her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I&#39;m tired, I want to rest,&#34; Tara said and turned to leave</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know we had a deal, you must bring back a husband in a month or you will marry the man i choose for you&#34; Angelina reminded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah whatever&#34; Tara yawned and walked into her room, closing her room door with a loud &#39;bang&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angelina sighed when she saw her behavior and continued watching the show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara lay down on the bed feeling tired, her body was sore and aching and she didn&#39;t feel like standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was feeling a little angry when her mom reminded her of the reason why she drank in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought all parents will be reluctant and couldn&#39;t bear for their children to marry, why is it different in her own case. Her parents couldn&#39;t wait to marry her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They have always been urging her to get married and have grandchildren but she was not ready yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tried to engage with a guy she doesn&#39;t know or like, so she promised them that she would bring the person she liked home that they should give her two months but they insisted that they could only give her a month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went ahead and confessed to her crush, but got rejected in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sad but not that sad so she went to drink with Sherry and lost her virginity to a male escort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents always looked at with an odd look whenever she said she doesn&#39;t like any man, the way they looked at her is always weird and it is freaking her out. They changed methods and started urging her to get married and have children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt that being an only child is not a good thing, if she had an elder brother or sister now she won&#39;t be facing her parents&#39; urges but her siblings will be the one too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They also asked her to inherit the company, fortunately she was still in university so she usually used that as an excuse, she was not sure how long the excuse would go because she would graduate soon right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just wants to sleep, eat and do nothing all day. She feels that having siblings is better once more, especially a male sibling who will be the one facing her parents nagging not her but she is not lucky enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone suddenly rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took it out from her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Sherry.</p>
