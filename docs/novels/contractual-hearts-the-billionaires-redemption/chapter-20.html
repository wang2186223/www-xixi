                <p>It was a bracelet she always saw with Jackson, he told her that it was very important to him because his late mother gave it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took it and looked towards where Jackson passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carried her back and walked out of the cafe, it was around 8 o&#39;clock by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked towards the direction he passed to see if she would be lucky to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After walking for a while she didn&#39;t see him, she sighed and decided to help him keep it and decided to give it to him any day she saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked towards a silent narrow part, it was dark and a little quiet there, she was about to turn back when she saw how quiet it was..   Until she heard two familiar voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Jackson and Wendy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you do what I asked you to do?&#34; She heard Wendy ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I did,&#34; Jackson replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you guys talk about for so long?&#34; Wendy pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you jealous? You don&#39;t have to, it is only you I love the most&#34; Jackson said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She peeped into the corner and she saw them making out while talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That bitch is too foolish. She thought you really loved her in high school,&#34; Wendy said. A hint of mockery was heard in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she didn&#39;t know you were the one who asked me to confess to her,&#34; Jackson replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for helping me this time muah&#34; Wendy said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything for you babe&#34; Jackson replied</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart trembled when she heard this So even her first dating was all her hallucination?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy was her best friend in school but Sherry didn&#39;t know that she is a hypocrite, she was framed a lot of times by Wendy in high school. Sherry stopped talking to her after this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never knew that Wendy was also behind it. She remembered the way she always told Wendy everything that happened between Jackson and her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she felt everything was ridiculous, everything was just her imagination but what did she own Wendy that made her treat her like this even though she treated Wendy sincerely?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t know how she walked out of that narrow part or the things they discussed later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a little lifeless, so her first love story was just her wishful thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is more reason for her never to fall in love or trust someone, everybody is just a hypocrite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued walking aimlessly in the cold night, even though she was shivering, she didn&#39;t stop walking before she finally stopped in front of a bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt an urge to drink alcohol to drown all her sorrows and sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the bar and ordered two strong alcoholic drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started drinking, she finished the two bottles by 10 o&#39;clock pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was feeling drunk and dizzy, so she stood up and took a taxi home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the house with the pass code and walked into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw Bryan sitting down at the couch with a laptop in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was putting on his robe with a pair of glasses on his eyes, he looked handsome while working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart pounded when she saw him but when she remembered that all men are the same. Her heart turned cold, she decided not to look at his deceiving face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up immediately and he heard her walk in, Bryan furrowed his brow, &#34;You drink?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34; She replied indifferently with a cold face..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan frowned when he heard this, &#34;How much did you drink?&#34; He asked again, Sherry didn&#39;t notice a tinge of worry in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stared at him with a cold smile on her face, &#34;Mr Bryan, i think you should not be meddling in my business right? And this is just a contract which will end soon besides I&#39;m not your real wife, so i should not be explaining my movement to you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>all men are jerks, all women are hypocrites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan&#39;s face darkened when he heard this, the living room aura suddenly turned gloomy and terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry could not help but subconsciously shivered when she saw the look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah&#34; Bryan scoffed and walked towards the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was really foolish for being worried about that ungrateful woman. He was supposed to be working inside his study room but he decided to work in the living room instead to wait for her. Not only is she ungrateful, she also asked him not to meddle in her business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry decided to use the stairs instead, She was already very drunk and dizzy although  she still had a bit of rationality in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a little uncomfortable and decided to take a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the bathroom after taking off her clothes, she lay down comfortably in the bathtub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled bitterly when she remembered everything that happened in high school.. She almost committed suicide in her high school because of depression not because she was heartbroken but because she was framed by her best friend. Everyone hated her a lot and everyone bully her even those that are younger than her and no one believed her when she said she didn&#39;t do any of the things they accused her of, no one stayed beside her except Emma, and they bullied Emma too because of her too they all avoided her like she was a plague.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had three ex boyfriends before she finally gave up on love, she was betrayed by two of them but her last boyfriend was the cause of her nightmare which she is trying to forget desperately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes grew heavy, she was feeling sleepy She tried to stand up from the bathtub but she couldn&#39;t no matter how much she tried so she gave up and just lay down there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell asleep inside the bathtub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she woke up again, she was feeling dizzy and her body felt heavy so she tried to leave the bathroom She was feeling very cold but she still couldn&#39;t stand up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She woke up thrice because her body was feeling cold and uncomfortable. Her body felt heavy and weak, she couldn&#39;t even lift her hand, her stomach also started hurting from her period cramps. She tried to speak but her voice came out hoarse and quiet even though she didn&#39;t hear what she was saying herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell unconscious again for the third time. She woke up again. She was still in the same position. Even the bathtub water had already turned bloody because of her period. She tried hard to stand up but it was the same as before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally fell unconscious and didn&#39;t wake up again.</p>
