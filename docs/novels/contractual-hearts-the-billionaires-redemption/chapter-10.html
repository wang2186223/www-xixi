                <p>&#34;Sister-in-law, What is your name, I&#39;m Flow Cunningham&#34; Flow introduced  herself softly but she looked at Sherry arrogantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry had heard about the Cunningham, Their company was on fifth level on the richest family in America. Most people were afraid and respected Cunningham because of their powers.. Sherry was not stupid she could understand what Flow was trying to tell her, she was telling her indirectly of her surname so Sherry would be sacred of her or flatter her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry Hue&#34; Sherry replied and acted like she didn&#39;t understand what she was trying to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a little curious about Bryan &#39;s background, when his Grandma welcomed her she looked like a normal Grandma but once Flow mentioned his engagement with Bryan, Her aura was strong and powerful so she knew that they were not just normal rich families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow was angry when she saw Sherry ignoring her. She felt like she was acting haughty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry Hue?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never heard of any socialite named that..she must find out her family background first before knowing her time to deal with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere was tense and a little awkward when Flow walked infortunately, Aunty Gladys walked out of the kitchen with a tray in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put the tray of food in front of Flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow thanked politely and elegantly before she started eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Gladys stood behind Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gladys, can you go into my room to bring what I prepared for my granddaughter in law?&#34; Grandma said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, hold on&#34; Aunty Gladys walked away quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow didn&#39;t talk because she was eating so the dining room was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Gladys came back with a small box in her hand, she handed it to Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma smiled at Sherry, &#34;This is for you&#34; She handed the box in her hand not giving her a chance to reject it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, I can&#39;t accept this,&#34; Sherry tried to return the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma pouted at her, &#34;Are you not happy to see me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am happy,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then accept it, it is my gift for you&#34; Grandma said immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma&#34; Sherry tried to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Bryan interrupted her, &#34;Just accept it since she gave it to you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry listened to it and was about to keep it in her bag when she heard Flow&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did Grandma give you sister-in-law? I&#39;m so jealous..it is probably a good item.. Grandma didn&#39;t even treat me as good as she treats you&#34; Flow said and lowered her head pitifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma chuckled when she saw this, &#34;Don&#39;t worry i have a gift for you too&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yaay..&#34; Flow clapped her hands like a baby when she heard, she glanced at Sherry with an arrogant smile. She was sure her gift would be better than Sherry&#39;s gift, Because that box Grandma gave Sherry was a little old. &#34;Sister-in-law, can I see the gift Grandma gave you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure&#34; Sherry smiled nonchalantly like she didn&#39;t see Flow&#39;s arrogant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the box, Flow stretched her head to look at the boxshe gasped when she saw what was in this box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is this not.?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile froze when she saw the content inside the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is this not the so-called ring the wives of the Ruger wore?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard that anybody who wears the ring can command the company and the secret agents in the Ruger residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow stared at the ring she always wanted in a daze for a few seconds. What did she have exactly that made Grandma give her the ring?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came from a peasant family and she was sure that she was not as beautiful and elegant as her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at with hatred in her eyes, she quickly forced out a smile so Grandma won&#39;t notice anything amiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wowthis ring is so beautiful&#34; Flow smiled gently, she clenched her fist tightly to keep herself from closing control of her emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t understand why Grandma gave the ring to her and what is the meaning of the ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed the box gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Gladys handed another box to Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma smiled at Flow, &#34;This is your own gift&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow smiled and accepted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Grandma, muah&#34; She said with an innocent face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow opened her own box and her expression changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a stupid necklace!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she tell her that she lacked a necklace? She wanted the ring not the necklaceAH! AH! She is so angry that she almost burst out in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly found an excuse and left to prevent herself from losing control of her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma smiled when she saw this, she hoped Flow would give up now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could see Flow&#39;s emotion clearly even though she tried to hide it, that was why Grandma gave Sherry the box in Flow&#39;s presence so she could give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan stood up, &#34;We will be leaving now&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry also stood up when he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys should stay for the night, i have cleaned up the room for you&#34; Grandma said immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan sighed helplessly, &#34;Yes&#34; he agreed because he knew he had to if not Grandma will refuse to use her medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at Bryan in surprise. He walked upstairs, and she quickly followed him into his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed the light switch on the wall. The room was very big, it was two times her room in his house, it was painted in black and white..it was dull and moderate..he doesn&#39;t have any pictures hanging in his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took off his suit and threw it on the couch in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan casually slipped his hand into his pocket and the corner of his lips slightly tilted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at her and suddenly lifted his leg and walked towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry quickly backed away until her back touched the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan stopped and smiled teasingly, &#34;You should shower in the bathroom, I&#39;ll take a shower in the guest room&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left without waiting for her reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was the only one left in the room. She looked hesitant at the bed in the bedroom and felt her scalp tingle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they going to share the same bed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the contract it is written that they won&#39;t be intimate right?</p>
