                <p>It was late in the morning when Sherry woke up. She opened her eyes and felt like her head was about to split because it was aching. She looked up and saw Bryan looking down at her too, his eyes were full of lust and desire, he looked like an animal starved, it looked like he could swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It frightened Sherry, that she tried to jump out of the bed but he didn&#39;t give her the chance and held her tightly, before flipping her he is now laying down on top of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to escape after seducing me?&#34; Bryan asked, his voice was hoarse and deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did she seduce him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-what?&#34; She stuttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised an eyebrow at her stunned expression &#34;You forgot what you did last night so soon?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry tried to recall what happened last night</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped when she remembered everything she did to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at her expression, Bryan knew that she already remembered, &#34;So you have to pay your debt back, Okay?&#34; He whispered, his throat was dry at how seductive she looked early in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed under his intense gaze, She tried to run away from his gaze but he held her tightly and trapped her under him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bent down and kissed on the lips, She responded so he deepened the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He released her, &#34;You have to take responsibility for what you started&#34; Bryan said, his voice was hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed before she could say anything, she responded to his kiss again, his desire became more intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt the air being sucked out of her lungs. Bryan&#39;s hand naughtily explored her waist. He continued kissing her deeply, domineering with lust and desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry panted as he withdrew from the intense kiss, &#34;Why should I always take responsibility?&#34; She pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan felt like pinching her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked adorable!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart itches to pinch her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you started it so you have to end it. If you also want me to take responsibility for you, how about I seduce you, so you can also ask me to take responsibility?&#34; Bryan asked with his eyebrows raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shameless!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he seduces her and she asks him to take responsibility, is she not causing trouble for herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wants to trick her but she won&#39;t fall for his trick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmph&#34; She harrumphed and ignored him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan chuckled looking at her sullen expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed her once again, he held her down and took off her pajamas, Sherry was still dazed in the kiss. His warm palm reached in and stroked her inch by inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan lips fell on her pale and delicate neck, biting and sucking them leaving love bites there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His large hand went straight to her back and started touching and massaging them. Sherry felt her body turned weak, she moaned softly under his torture. She melted in his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan pushed his swollen manhood against her, through her panties, &#34;Are you ready?&#34; Bryan asked in a hoarse voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his throbbing desire that was rubbing against her, Sherry tried to push him away. &#34;No I&#39;m still sore&#34; She lied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan laughed,, &#34;Little liar&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed in embarrassment when he said it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan snorted when he saw her red face, moving his lips against her chest, sucking in pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He removed her pants and pushed his crotch into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry gritted her teeth, &#34;It hurts, be gentle&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her passionate moaning aroused Bryan more, he took her ears between his lips, Sherry felt a sense of ecstasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry opened her eyes and stared at his fair neck. She leaned over and licked his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her action caused him to lose control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan growled, &#34;Little slut&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally poured his content into her after a series of begging. He released her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry panted softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He is such a beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She promised not to touch alcohol anymore so she won&#39;t provoke him again and give him the opportunity to take advantage of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go and shower&#34; Sherry said and tried to stand up, her body was feeling sticky because of the sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you walk?&#34; Bryan teased her with a serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry snorted at the hooligan, &#34;Of course I can&#34; She replied and tried to stand up from the bed but her leg had turned jelly and trembled when she tried to stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked you before&#34; Bryan said as he bit his lips to prevent himself from laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face flushed red in embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it her fault?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all his fault!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan stood up from the bed, he carried her into his arms and walked into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put her inside the bathtub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you manage yourself?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, quickly leave&#34; Sherry pushed him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay fine I&#39;ll go and cook&#34; Bryan smiled and walked out of the bathroom humming happily like a satisfied beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry quickly showered and walked out of the bathroom. She opened her closet but she couldn&#39;t find any of her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her closet was empty, she was confused but she couldn&#39;t go out to meet Bryan wrapped in a towel so as not to arouse the sleeping beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened his closet and took out one of his longer shirts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put it on and it was long enough for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the room and walked into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hubby&#34; Sherry called, she felt a little embarrassed calling him that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was not in the living room, so she walked into the kitchen and saw him cooking with a serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stood at the door and watched him quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked so handsome when he was serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen enough?&#34; Bryan asked her without turning back..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He already knew that she was there and he had noticed her immediately when she came but she didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know that I&#39;m here?&#34; Sherry asked casually and walked into the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe because we are man and wife,&#34; Bryan said and turned around to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes turned darker when he saw her in his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so seductive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sleeping manhood which was already satisfied aroused again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not noticing his odd behavior, Sherry walked towards and looked at the food he cooked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a bite and hummed in delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan became more aroused when he heard her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delicious!&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food he cooked was so delicious, she was sure it was more delicious than a high restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan suddenly hugged her from behind, he wrapped his hand around his waist,  his manhood was touching her butt directly. Sherry froze when she felt what was poking her back. She was familiar with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh! Not again Sherry lamented in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry&#34; He whispered into her ears, his voice was hoarse and sensual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No not here&#34; Sherry tried to push him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I want to do it here,&#34; Bryan said in a spoiled voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you have work to do?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already so late but he is still at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have any important thing to do at the company,&#34; Bryan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The food will turn cold&#34; Sherry came up with another excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll warm it back,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pouted and looked at him with a pitiful face, &#34;But I&#39;m still feeling sore&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pitiful face aroused Bryan more; he felt like he would lose control but he endured it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be gentle&#34; Bryan replied and kissed her, he carried her and put her on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t protest anymore and gave in to him.</p>
