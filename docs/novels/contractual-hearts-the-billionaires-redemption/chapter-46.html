                <p>Sherry helped Bryan into the car and sat down next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Bryan with a stern face, &#34;Why are you doing that to me?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan felt an itch in his heart when he saw her stern face, she looked so adorable, her stern face looked adorable and cute, he felt his crotch rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even her face turns him on!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me with an innocent face, &#34;What did I do?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How is she supposed to say that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn this man is really shameless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to turn around and ignore him, when he cupped her small face, with a sense of urgency, he pressed her down the car and started to kiss her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was caught off guard, she widened her eyes while he circled his arms around her waist. He deepened the kiss and hugged her firmly that she won&#39;t be able to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin noticed that the car was silent, he looked back from the mirror and saw what was happening. He quickly looked in front and pretended like he could not see anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>See no evil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was almost breathless, she felt as though she was being devoured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His movement was dominating, he slid his hand into her clothes. Sherry started struggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were in the car beside someone who was there but no matter how much she struggled she still couldn&#39;t escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry bit her lips to stop the moan that was about to escape from her mouth, she felt a strange warmth against her thigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan didn&#39;t pause at all, he moved his lips away from her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop&#34; Sherry said breathless, she tried to regain her breath, panting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t release her and moved his lips to her neck, kissing and sucking her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pushed him away strongly, he fell back. She sat down straight, panting heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scoundrel&#34; She scolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat down straight and realized that he lost control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The self control he was proud of is nothing in front of Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry walked out of the car and ran into the house with a red face. She felt so embarrassed that she couldn&#39;t look at Calvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went back into the room and walked into the bathroom to take a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She changed her clothes and walked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met Bryan in the living room, she ignored him, feeling mad at him and walked out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hailed a cab to her mom&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It has been awhile since she went there, the other day she went there her mom was not at home. It was only Nancy that she saw at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taxi stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry paid the taxi man and walked into her mom&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom was inside the living room watching a show on the television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom smiled immediately she saw her, &#34;Sherry, you are here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded and sat down on the couch opposite her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom asked, her gaze still on the television, &#34;How is your work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine mom&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom glanced at with a serious expression, &#34;Let&#39;s talk, Sherry&#34; She said with a serious tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry glanced at her, &#34;Okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw Wendy, your friend from high school yesterday&#34; her mom started, Sherry heart sank when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry muttered, she felt awkward talking to her mom, she felt that they are not close anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would rather keep things to herself than tell her mom, she doesn&#39;t know why maybe it was because when she needed her she was not there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be honest, she blamed her mom a little, but she didn&#39;t hold a grudge against her and did her duty by giving her money weekly and sometimes monthly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything that happened to her from high school till now, she never told her mom or anybody about it She always keeps everything in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She told me that you snatched her friend&#39;s fiance just because the guy is rich, Sherry you can&#39;t do that Don&#39;t forget that mistresses are bad people who people hate a lot, don&#39;t ruin someone else&#39;s happiness just because of money or your happiness&#34; Her mom warned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry gave her mom a self-deprecating smile. She didn&#39;t ask her whether it was true or not but she already came to the conclusion that she is the third party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, you didn&#39;t even ask my daughter if it was true or not but you already believed the random words someone told you?&#34; Sherry asked with a bitter smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, I don&#39;t blame you but Wendy is a good child and she can&#39;t lie to me,&#34; Her mom said with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry muttered and walked out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry!&#34; Her mom called her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t stop and walked out looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come back now, if you knew that I&#39;m your mother&#34; Her mom yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry turned a deaf ear to what she said and hailed a taxi, she got into the taxi, feeling so sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seems only Bryan and his Grandma trusted her even though she had not known them for long, but someone who gave birth to her doubted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt so sad and lonely, the feeling of despair that she always felt was returning to her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t tell her mom about the things Wendy did to her in high school yet, if she told her will she even believe her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t understand why people usually choose to believe Wendy rather than her? Is it part of her charm?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hatred for Wendy became deeper, if Wendy was standing in front of her she was sure that she would probably beat her to death or try to kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why can&#39;t she just leave her alone? She just wants to start living her life peacefully but she still continues creating trouble for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no wonder why she thought of committing suicide when she was young and naive, even when she is all grown up she still doesn&#39;t want her to live her life peacefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thing she regretted the most was becoming friends with Wendy, everyone would probably love their high school and would yearn to go back there, but all the feelings she had left for high school was hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated the school, she was humiliated a lot in that school by the students, She had to go for therapy for six months before she regained herself, if not perhaps she would have turned into a psychotic killer and wants to kill all the students in the school because of everything she went through in the school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They protected Wendy like an egg while they humiliated her and trample on her dignity multiple times. She had to force herself to complete her high school even with all the humiliation she was going through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry snapped out of her train of thought, confused as she looked out of the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that Bryan&#39;s house was not far away from her mom&#39;s house. It is just like an hour&#39;s journey but they have been on the road for an hour and thirty minutes now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw that she was not familiar with the place the driver was driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was scared and quickly took her phone out , she texted Bryan and told him where she was, she hit the send button.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her head and saw that the driver was pointing a gun at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so scared, her palms become sweaty. She clenched her fist to stop herself from trembling.</p>
