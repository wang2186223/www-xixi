                <p>&#34;Sister in law&#34; Flow called with a gentle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow expression changed at her behavior, she gritted her teeth in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you arrogant for? Are you not just a third party&#34; Wendy said loudly, the people shopping inside the mall heard her clearly and stared at Sherry with disgust in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled nonchalantly, &#34;When did I become the third party? Is it your boyfriend that i snatched or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy glared at her, &#34;What? You are still arrogant? My friend and her fiance are already engaged but you still shamelessly snatched him away&#34; Wendy said arrogantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow held her hand pitifully, &#34;Forget it, let&#39;s just go&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy became more angry when she saw that Flow was gentle and understanding, &#34;No, Bestie you should not be so easy going, let&#39;s teach this third party a lesson&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant gloated when she saw this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph so she is just a shameless third party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled when she heard this, she turned and glanced at Flow &#34;So Miss Flow i snatched your fiance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow panicked when she saw her smile, she feigned a frightened expression, &#34;No Sistt-er.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy stood in front of Wendy and shouted at Sherry aggressively, &#34;What? Why are you trying to sacred the poor lady again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry mouthed an &#39;Oh&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a shameless third party is that shameless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe that she is just a third party, she looked so beautiful and innocent&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is why, you should never judge people by face&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people inside the mall despise Sherry even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow smirked when she saw this scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would make sure to destroy her reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could tell Bryan truly loved Sherry because of the way she handled her with care and gentleness that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, she&#39;d deceived herself by thinking that Bryan only married Sherry because of Grandma&#39;s health and urging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jealousy in her eyes was overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Bryan had grown up together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she was the only female friend beside him, even though he didn&#39;t talk to her he still treated her well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he had never been gentle to anyone except his Grandma, nor had he looked at her lovingly or gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d known Bryan since she was young and always chased after him, he didn&#39;t show any expression to her so she thought he liked her too. She had imagined being Bryan&#39;s bride since she was young, the treatment Sherry was receiving she had never received before, how could Sherry deserve it?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she saw that Sherry wasn&#39;t wearing a ring the first day she met her, she guessed that Bryan was just playing with her so she would wait for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was very happy as long as Bryan wasn&#39;t in love with the woman. She would gladly wait for him. After marriage there is still divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he didn&#39;t like Sherry, he wouldn&#39;t protect her or defend her so she was just trying her luck by making Wendy provoke her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he didn&#39;t protect her, she would wait for him but if he protected she would make Sherry regret the day she agreed to marry Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Flow, Bryan told me he only sees us as his sister, but it seems the feelings you harbor for him are different.&#34; Sherry said in an understanding way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan never told her anything about Flow and she doesn&#39;t care about that. She just wanted to try her luck before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the people look at Flow with an odd look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow panicked when she saw the look people were giving her, &#34;Nonsense! I treated Brother Bryan as my brother&#34; Flow immediately clarified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people turned to look at Wendy and pointed fingers at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So her friend was lying by saying this young lady snatched her friend fiance before&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmph, she is a liar&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She just wanted to cause misunderstanding and wants to embarrass the young lady&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy was about to explode when she saw the pointed people were giving her, Flow quickly held her hand so she would not say anything more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow looked at Sherry with a gentle smile, &#34;Sister-in-law can you afford that? I can help you pay for it if you can&#39;t afford it&#34; Flow said generously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need, thank you&#34; Sherry rejected her calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tsk tsk why put up a air?&#34; Wendy shot her a look of contempt. &#34;She is already nice offering to help you pay but you keep acting arrogantly&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled, she glanced at her and brought out her black card, &#34;Yes i can&#39;t afford it&#34; Sherry said and flashed her a mockery smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendy&#39;s eyes were full of jealousy when she saw the black card in Sherry&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant gloating smile stiffened when she saw the black card in Sherry&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she can&#39;t afford it with the black card in her hand then that means no one else can afford it&#34; Someone said in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you say that? Is that black card rare? I have seen many black cards before, ``another person asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know anything, do you? I&#39;m working at Federal Bank of America, the card in her hand is very rare. Five people owned it and we don&#39;t know the people who owned it except the higher ups I didn&#39;t know she also owned one Wow, she is really rich, ``the person explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd gasped when they heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The young lady is so rich?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And this lady said she was a mistress, if she is a poor mistress then no one else is rich&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow glared at the black card in Sherry&#39;s hand with jealousy in her eyes The card in her hand was a gold card, and it is nothing compared to the card in Sherry&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Brother Bryan give her the card?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart sank, and she became more jealous at the possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t know that the card was Sherry&#39;s card, when she was working her ass off doing both legal and illegal business then, Flow was still a kid back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonsense! Who knows if the card is fake&#34; Flow shouted she couldn&#39;t accept the fact that Sherry owned a black card while she owned none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She became friends with Flow because of her gold card, she became more jealous when she saw the black card, she had never seen it before, this was the first time she saw it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if the card is found to be a fake card, Hmph she will get a reward from the mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One must know Gold mall was a well known luxurious shopping mall and it is owned by Rainbow company, only rich people frequented here so if they catch someone who wanted to use a fake card as payment, the person will be jailed immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow anger was reduced by half when she heard this If the card is really fake, then Sherry would be jailed.</p>
