                <p>Sherry was shocked when the room door suddenly opened, she looked up and saw that it was Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan&#39;s expression darkened when he saw her with a towel that didn&#39;t reach her knee but when he remembered the reason why he came, his expression turned gloomy and terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shivered subconsciously when she saw Bryan looking gloomy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you accept Flow money and agreed to divorce me?&#34; Bryan interrupted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow informed him so fast?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded truthfully, &#34;I did and asked her to give me a month since we will be divorcing in a month&#34; Sherry replied innocently since she felt that what she did was not bad anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry immediately noticed that he looked even more dangerous at this point. He was not showing much expression but the temperature around him dropped drastically. Unable to breathe at how dangerous he looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never seen him like this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart was almost in her throat. Facing his cold face she was so frightened and her heart was screaming for her to run away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly gave a chuckle and his cold gaze was cast upon Sherry. He walked out of the room and closed the room door with a &#39;bang&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt her leg become weak and couldn&#39;t stand properly, she slumped down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan walked out of the house and sat down in his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched the steering tightly, blue veins popped out of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took out his phone and dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come out for a drink,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this Bryan? Did you steal his phone?&#34; The other person asked in a surprise tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan pursed his lips and asked &#34;Are you coming or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Coming, coming,&#34; The person said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan hung up and started the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove to the club where he always met his friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seductive Club, 10pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan sat down inside the room he and his friends always stayed at whenever they came here, he ordered for three bottles of whiskey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter quickly delivered it and walked out of the room, afraid that he would disturb him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He poured some whiskey into his glass and drank three cups before the room door finally opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan arched an eyebrow when he saw Cornelius, &#34;You are late&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius choke when he heard this, &#34;You are the one who is always late and i have to beg multiple times before you come out to drink&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was also Bryan&#39;s childhood friend, but he doesn&#39;t like going out, he is a hacker, he was the one who Bryan called for him to investigate Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius walked towards him and sat down opposite him, he poured whiskey into his glass and took a sip. &#34;Are you in a bad mood?&#34; He asked when he noticed that his aura seemed gloomy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was furious, even Cornelius a man could tell that he was in a bad mood but that woman didn&#39;t even care about him. He pursues his lip in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius raised an eyebrow when he didn&#39;t speak, &#34;Why are you in a bad mood? Is it because that woman named Sherry hue who you asked me to investigate? Who is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I married her,&#34; Bryan said after keeping quiet for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius gasped in disbelief when he heard this, &#34;You? You are married? And I didn&#39;t know about it? Are we still friends?&#34; Cornelius asked multiple questions but Bryan didn&#39;t reply any. Cornelius looked at him oddly, &#34;Is Is your thing even functioning? I thought you liked men?&#34; Cornelius asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly shut up when he saw the murderous look Bryan gave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a contract marriage,&#34; Bryan said when Cornelius stopped talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh she was the one you signed a contract marriage with, the one Richard recommended?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius nodded, &#34;Then why are you in a bad mood?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She accepted Flow 100 million dollars and agreed to divorce me&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So?&#34; Cornelius asked in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t understand? I&#34; Bryan stopped talking and poured whiskey into his glass and drank it all in one gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius realized something, &#34;You fell for her?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Bryan didn&#39;t deny it he cursed when he realized that his guess was right, &#34;Fuck&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really fell for her? I thought you said you are waiting for your crush who you fall in school with?&#34; Cornelius asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan had told him and Richard before, whenever he was asked the reason why he is not married yet or dating he always responds that he is waiting for his crush who he never saw her face before except the scar behind her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is the one&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius gasped again, &#34;She is the one? When you asked me for a video after asking me to investigate her, she is the girl in the video?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius opened his mouth and couldn&#39;t close it for awhile, he got a lot of shock tonight and was not sure he would be able to sleep</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34; Bryan said, he had finished two bottles of whiskey in a short while and was drunk already. Tipsy, he looked at Cornelius &#34;She wants to leave me after a month, what should i do?&#34; He asked Cornelius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time Cornelius ever saw him with an helpless look, his expression was always cold and arrogant like nothing could affect him. He finally believed when people say love is a weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius didn&#39;t know what to say, he said hesitatingly, &#34;How about you get her pregnant? So she won&#39;t be able to leave even if she wants to&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the only advice on his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan thought about it seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wants money he could give her all his assets just for her not leave, the 100 million dollars Flow gave her was like a drop of water in his wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll send you home, you are drunk and can&#39;t drive&#34; Cornelius stood up and walked towards him, to support him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at him seriously and said, &#34;I&#39;m not drunk&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius felt amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All drunkards always say the same thing, they are not drunk when they are drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you are not drunk, I&#39;ll drive you home&#34; Cornelius said and supported him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked out of the club, he helped to the co - driver seat and used the seat belt on him before turning around and walked towards the driver seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got in and started the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly felt that his life was pitiful, he even had to take care of him when he was drunk, how would he find his own girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got to Bryan house in an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius parked the car, &#34;We are here&#34; He told Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan opened his eyes and looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his head and glanced at him, &#34;Okay&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No thank you?&#34; Cornelius asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan ignored him and walked out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn, son of a bitch..  Ungrateful ass&#34; He cursed him in a low tone so Bryan won&#39;t hear but Bryan&#39;s ear is very sharp and heard him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems you don&#39;t want to get your bonus of this month&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you can&#39;t do that, don&#39;t forget that i drove you home&#34; Cornelius said pitifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I ask you to?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Ungrateful&#39; Cornelius cursed him in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quickly get lost&#34; Bryan looked at him with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gladly&#34; Cornelius ran out.</p>
