                <p>&#34;I have evidence that she cheated&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice said, everyone turned around to look at who just spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vera walked onto the stage, her face twisted with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara face became flushed in her anger,&#34;Vera is too much, everyone saw that your voice was very nice and unique but she is saying nonsense just because she lost to you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled leisurely like she didn&#39;t care about Vera, she was very confident in her music and voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her hardest time, she composed the music with a lot of her emotions.. She was feeling depressed a lot then, she had nowhere to vent her thoughts.. She could only stay alone and composed some music to express herself no one has ever listened to her music..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time she sang it to people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara took a deep breath and calmed down when she saw Sherry was unconcerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Vera?&#34; The coordinator called, a little surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry cheated,&#34; Vera said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have evidence?&#34; The coordinator asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No but I&#39;m sure she cheated,&#34; Vera said as she clenched her fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t think Sherry would come today, she heard that she took a sick leave so she thought she wouldn&#39;t come to school this week, if she knew she would have destroyed her voice instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was twisted with jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t talk with evidence Miss Vera&#34; The coordinator smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The student also started insulting her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she think the world revolved around her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hehe it seems Miss Vera doesn&#39;t want to accept her loss&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just because you are always the winner in the previous years doesn&#39;t mean you will continue be the winner&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Accept your loss!&#34; Someone from the student said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Accept your loss!&#34; The students also said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vera clenched her fist tightly when she saw this, she stared at Sherry who was sitting down with a nonchalant look, her eyes turned vicious as she glared at her.. She felt a little embarrassed when the students didn&#39;t stop telling her to accept her loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran out of the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girls who hated her before snickered when they saw the way she ran out of the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coordinator cleared his throat, &#34;Miss Sherry, please come to the stage and accept your award and gift&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was surprised when she heard this, there was a gift?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is the only thing on her mind, the award is nonsense to her it us not like she can exchange it for money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just decided to fuck up, Vera planned she didn&#39;t expect that she would get a gift too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked towards the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coordinator gave her an award, and a check too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry grinned happily when she saw the check Even though she hadn&#39;t opened it yet, she was sure that the money was worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bowed at the judges and students before walking back to her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did it!!&#34; Tara said cheerfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled and opened the check to see the amount of money inside of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her good mood improved when she Saw the figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was 10 million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry walked into the house, fortunately Bryan was not back, she was trying to avoid him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a shower, she finished her homework and went to bed. In the late night, the door of Sherry&#39;s room opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall and handsome figure walked in He stood there and just stared at her sleeping face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Sherry showered and got ready for school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She changed her clothes and walked downstairs She was shocked when she saw a variety of foods in the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time she had ever seen food since she came here</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young Madam&#34; She heard a voice say from behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry turned around and was a little surprised when she saw an unfamiliar face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The middle aged woman smiled when she saw how beautiful Sherry was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young master has a good taste She was sure her little master would be very handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sent by old madam to help you cook, my name is edge&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Old Madam?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan&#39;s Grandma?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Aunty Edge&#34; Sherry nodded and added, &#34;I&#39;ll leave first&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young Madam, breakfast is ready&#34; Aunty Edge said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ll skip breakfast, I&#39;m in a hurry and must go to school now&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Edge shook her head, &#34;No that is not okay, you should eat&#34; She added, &#34;Besides you are too skinny&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sighed when she saw this and obeyed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked to the dining room and sat down. She looked around and didn&#39;t see Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm What about Bryan?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here&#34; She heard his voice and walked out of the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry muttered and bowed her head, her face a little red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked so handsome and sexy in the morning and even his voice sounded sexy and hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is thinking dirty again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan sat down next to her, Sherry peeked at him a little and saw that his face was full of dark circles but he was still looking delicious as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed he didn&#39;t sleep well last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t sleep well last night, he sat down beside her because of her nightmare. He was also the one who asked Grandma to send Aunty Edge here So they would be sleeping in the same room and he noticed that she doesn&#39;t eat breakfast sometimes too. If they start sleeping in the same room, he would be able to watch over whenever she had a nightmare in her sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started eating in silence Sherry&#39;s head was lowered all this while not daring to look at him so she wouldn&#39;t drool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They soon finished eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stood up and was about to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll drive you to school&#34; She heard him say behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could go myself&#34; Sherry whispered, she added, &#34;Besides you must be busy with work&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not busy&#34; Bryan interrupted her and walked out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry bade Aunty Edge &#39;Goodbye&#39; before following him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was waiting for her inside the car. Sherry had no choice but to open the door and sat down next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started the car and drove out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got to her school in an hour Sherry was about to get down from the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait&#34; she heard him say, his voice sounded so sexy that she felt herself shiver subconsciously not because of the cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stiffened immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything?&#34; She saw without looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt him put something on her hair, she wanted to turn around to see what he was doing but she froze when she felt something on her hair, she stood still when he didn&#39;t make any movement anymore Sherry opened the car and walked out of the car hurriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was looking at her in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scar behind her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Is she the one?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart raced when he thought of the possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took out his cell phone, he found a number and called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call went through and a male voice said, &#34;Mr Bryan, do you need me for anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to investigate someone&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is it? A male or female? Her full name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Female.. Sherry Hue&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need the results in two hours, all the details about her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t bother to investigate her because Richard recommended her to him but because of the scar behind her ear, it felt oddly familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hoped she is the one if she is the one he will never let her go anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed and felt like the time was running slower than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove to his company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rainbow Company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat down in his office waiting impatiently, looking at his phone every second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone rang</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the number he called this morning..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan picked the phone and placed it on his ear, he didn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Bryan, you have to prepare yourself  first&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan felt slightly ominous when he heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talk!&#34; He said.</p>
