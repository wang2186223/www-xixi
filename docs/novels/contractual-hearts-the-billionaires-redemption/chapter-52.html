                <p>Bryan saw her immediately as he walked out of the room. He walked towards her at an average pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry raised her head up when she noticed that someone was walking towards them, she saw that it was Bryan, she smiled brightly like a girl in love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was dazed momentarily by her smile, his heart fluttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are here, hubby,&#34; Sherry said in a delighted voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan&#39;s heart skipped a beat when he heard her voice, it sounds so seductive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the third time she was willing to call him hubby on her own accord.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm, I&#39;m here to take you home,&#34; Bryan said in a deep voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed and her heart warmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was always confused about home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she realized later that home was anywhere the person who made your heart skip a beat is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at Tara worried, &#34;Should we drop you off?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was red and she was feeling dizzy, but rational.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, my driver is on his way, go baby. I want to be a godmother quickly&#34; Tara said, in a slow voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed, &#34;Nonsense we will be leaving now&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go baby&#34; Tara cheered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry put her hand in Bryan&#39;s outstretched hand and they walked out of the club together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David drove them home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry fell asleep inside the car, so Bryan had to carry her into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lay her down on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to get up when she suddenly pulled him, he was caught off guard, so he fell on the bed. Sherry took the opportunity and flipped onto him and took the upper hand with her entire body. She was laying down on top of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, don&#39;t play with fire&#34; Bryan said, his throat was dry and his voice was hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled brightly ignoring him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you not feeling sore from what we did last night?&#34; Bryan asked, worried that he would wear her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went crazy last night, maybe it was because it has been weeks they did it last after his first night, they did it for hours she fainted thrice and begged him for mercy before he was finally willing to let her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wants it, he is willingly to do it with her but he just didn&#39;t want to wear her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started grinding her butt against his waist as she sat there. Bryan crotch was so aroused that it took everything in him not to flip her back and have his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was drunk and she was just having fun and didn&#39;t know what she was doing, she finally stopped moving her butt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then bent down and kissed his face, nose, and neck. She kissed his tiny pink lips and teased it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She changed her target and kissed his sensitive ear, she licked it gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was so aroused but he kept his calm and let her do whatever she wanted, watch her and he wanted to know how far she could go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened his suit, and his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kissed his Adam&#39;s apple and licked it, she started sucking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan couldn&#39;t take it anymore and flipped her, their position changed, he was on top of her now. Bryan pinned her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blinked in a daze, the look in her eyes was one of intoxication. It looked seductive and foggy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She attempted to flip back but Bryan pinned her down firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry couldn&#39;t flip so she grind her waist on his crotch, they were facing each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was so turned on that he almost stripped her naked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sealed his lips with hers and kissed her with full dominance and lust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry put her leg behind his back and folded it, then she started grinding her waist on his crotch more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan breaks their intense kiss and tears her clothes in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t wait anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him in a daze, her eyes were innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan put his face on her neck, licking and sucking on them. Sherry moaned softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved to remove her panties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his head after removing her pants, he stared at her and saw that she had fallen asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan cursed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ignited the fire in him and fell asleep without extinguishing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He covered her body with a blanket securely before standing up from the bed. He walked towards the bathroom to take a cold shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara stood up and walked towards the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finished her business in the restroom and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met a man outside and immediately she walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had such beautiful features, his deep dark eyes piercing deep into her soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was at least six feet tall, so he was taller than her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to walk past her when Tara stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, handsome hunk&#34; Tara smiled brightly, a little drunk and dizzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man grunted and was about to walk when Tara walked closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we sleep together?&#34; Tara asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s mouth twitched when he heard what the woman in front of him said. Were all women so straight forward and wanted to sleep with any man in sight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just came back from a business trip which lasted for two months and he came to meet an important client at the club. He was on his way home when she stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; Richard rejected her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara pouted sadly, &#34;Why not? I won&#39;t pester you to take responsibility, you also don&#39;t like me?&#34; Tara asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard sighed, she looked like she would cry once he says &#39;Yes&#39;, &#34;No&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara&#39;s eyes brightened, &#34;Does that mean you like me?&#34; Tara said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did he say that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara sealed her lips with his, before he finished his word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting one arm around his neck, and kissed him deeply and clumsily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was her first kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard wanted to push her away but his hand froze so he couldn&#39;t push her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because he can&#39;t, he just doesn&#39;t want to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips were tender and sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her lips touched his, Richard felt shocked by the electricity that electro his body. His heart suddenly races like crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So seductive</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes became darker and held her tighter. Tara didn&#39;t notice his odd behavior and licked his lips gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard held her tightly and deepened the kiss, he kissed her hard. His tongue slid into her mouth fiercely filled with lust and desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He locked her in a wall and continued kissing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coincidentally, the room Richard just met his client was opened so he carried her into the room directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway she said she won&#39;t pester him for anything and they don&#39;t even know each other in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It will be counted as a one night stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lay her down on the bed and lay on top of her, he kissed her lips wildly, like a beast starved while Tara was like a sheep waiting to be devoured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed her and removed her clothes one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara&#39;s heart was beating fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally she would lose her virginity to a handsome hunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no regrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just feeling a little scared. She heard that it always hurt.</p>
