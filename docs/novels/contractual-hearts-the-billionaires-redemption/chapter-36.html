                <p>She had come back from abroad to marry Bryan and she was ready to wait for him if he is not ready to marry yet she would wait for him even if it takes years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow took her spoon and started eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry and Bryan also started eating silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan put some fish on Sherry plates, Sherry was shocked and looked up at him but his face was indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow gripped her spoon tightly when she saw this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He has never put a meal on her food before, how could this bitch deserve it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took her spoon and was about to put a fish on his plate, he suddenly carried his plate and avoided her The fish fell on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, i don&#39;t like someone putting food on my plate&#34; Bryan said casually and continued eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentle smile she feigned was gone when she saw this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked when she heard this. She took her spoon and picked up the meat and put it on his plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan took it and ate it happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, my wife is an exception,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow clenched her jaw tightly, the ball of jealousy grew and rose in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed the wine glass on the table heavily, and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry and Bryan looked up at her when they heard her movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow took a deep breath and kept her emotions properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried her best to maintain her rationality and forced out an unnatural smile. &#34;I&#39;d like to head home first, i wanted to use the meal to apologize for my friend behavior at the mall yesterday but i suddenly feel unwell, I&#39;ll treat you to a meal next time&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you should rest then, Miss Flow&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow glanced at Bryan but he didn&#39;t even look at her non-talk to her. She faked a smile at Sherry, &#34;Thank you I will&#34; Flow retracted her gaze from Sherry. The moment she did so, her gaze turned vicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry Hue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You took away my man, Do you think you can be happy forever with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some thing, i can&#39;t have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, don&#39;t think about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ll let you never have it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, I&#39;ll take back everything that I have lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that time, i want you to pay the most painful price. I want you to live a hundred times more painful You will wish you were dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I won&#39;t let you go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would rather kill Sherry than let her be happy in the arms of the man she loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Does she think she can become a phoenix once she marries Bryan? She is just a sparrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She can only be a sparrow!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised his eyebrows &#34;Mm, Nice one you just used me&#34; Bryan said and stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt a little guilty when she heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was true she really used him but it was his affair in the first place. Why should she help him clean it up? She doesn&#39;t know why she is feeling a little guilty when he looks at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm&#34; Sherry tried to talk but he sealed her lips with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hot breath fanned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He deepened the kiss, ravenous and more wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to push him away but he held her hand in place with one of his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used his other hand and caressed her breast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh&#34; Sherry moaned in his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan felt a certain place has risen by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He withdrew from her lips and put his mouth on her neck instead, he bit and nibbled on the spot leaving a mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh&#34; Sherry groaned when he bit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is he a dog?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door to the room opened suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry quickly pushed him away and sat down straight feeling a little embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan straightened up, he looked up and stared at who the intruder was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a waiter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan glared at him coldly, the waiter felt a shiver run in his spine when he saw his cold gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly looked down and avoided his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34; The waiter tried to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan stood up from his seat, &#34;Let&#39;s go&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stood up and followed him behind, she looked at the waiter with a grateful gaze before walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan started the car and drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive was silent, no one said anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry ran out of the car immediately he parked the car..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly ran into the room, her lips were swollen from the kiss She couldn&#39;t face Aunty Edge with her swollen lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at her reflection in the mirror, she saw the mark he left on her neck and cursed him multiple times on her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he born in the month of the dog?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door of the room opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan walked into the room, he glanced at Sherry briefly before opening his wardrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took out some clothes and put them on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started unbuttoning the one he was currently wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took off his shirt like Sherry was not there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry gulped subconsciously when she saw his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he seducing her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he was, then congratulations to him he won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t take her eyes off his shirt, it looked so manly that she felt like she would have a nosebleed if she continued watching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You liked what you saw?&#34; She heard him ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded her head like she was under spell..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly shook her head when she realized what she just did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled when he saw her flustered expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34; Sherry said when she realized what he just did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised an eyebrow and stared at her, &#34;What? I only asked a question and you nodded I didn&#39;t force you to reply&#34; He said with an innocent face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry glared at him angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was purposely seducing her, she still fell for his trap even though she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, &#34;Did you remember what you did yesterday? You tried to seduce me yesterday night&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him in disbelief, &#34;You are lying&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am i? You almost strip naked&#34; he sighed dramatically, &#34;I tried to stop you but you refused&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry covered her ears, &#34;You are lying!&#34; She yelled and ran into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rinses her face with water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she really do that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She believed that he was telling the truth because he didn&#39;t have any reason to lie to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>33</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A month later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days have been going fine for Sherry, the month was peaceful with no trouble maker even if they wanted to find trouble for her she returned it two times to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she could say it was peaceful and her contract marriage with Bryan would end soon, a month and two weeks to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the living room, coming back from school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met Bryan sitting on the couch in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening&#34; She greeted him and was about to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard him say, so she turned around and looked at him, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow is Grandma&#39;s birthday, she is organizing a banquet and you would be introduced as my wife in the banquet too&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry knitted her brows, confusion could be seen in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What does that mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their marriage would end in a month and two weeks, so is there a need to introduce her to the world as his wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a little disturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t resist opening her mouth to ask him, &#34;Why? Our marriage will end in a month and two weeks, so is that necessary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan&#39;s face became gloomy when he heard her saying that their marriage would end in a month and two weeks, even though that was the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt a little disturbed and sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pursued his lips and reply, &#34;That is what Grandma wants&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded that she understood and walked back to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still sharing a room with Bryan because Aunty Edge was still living with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She showered and lay down on the bed feeling tired because of today&#39;s class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell asleep in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know when Bryan entered the room, she was sound asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Tony family had established themselves in Starlight City for many years. Naturally, many famous and rich people gathered for the Old Madam &#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The banquet was supposed to start at four. However, many people had arrived and gathered around at around three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calming and elegant music echoed throughout the large hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere was lively and calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People gathered in groups, some young females and their mom gathered together, gossiping intensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan Tony was naturally the talk of the town. Even though he was not there yet, many people were anticipating his arrival and some females were excited and dressed up beautifully. Maybe they will catch his attention because they heard that he was still single.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While some businessmen wants to introduce their daughter to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, A baby green figure entered. The color wasn&#39;t exactly complementary to the theme of the party which was blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The precious stones on the gown glistened beautifully in the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was too beautiful for anyone to take their eyes off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure strolled into the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress was neither too short nor too long, and it showed off her slender long legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The makeup was exquisite too and she looked like a model.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looked so beautiful&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which background is she from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Judging by her dress, she doesn&#39;t look poor&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does she have a boyfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remembered her, she is Flow Cunningham I heard from a secret source that she is engaged to Bryan Tony&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, so she is taken?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow was extremely satisfied with her appearance, and the envious look people gave her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled gently and felt extremely proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gasps got louder and Flow seemed to have become the center attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure Brother Bryan would like her the way she is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was anticipating whether Bryan would bring Sherry or not to the public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t invited to the party, but she felt that it is not bad for her to be shameless once and attend even though she was not invited Besides, Grandma was still not talking with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked and sat down quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, her phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the screen and saw that it was her best friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked it up and put the phone on her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Janet&#34;</p>

                <p>Flow hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt that people were not looking at her anymore, she was confused of who caught the people&#39;s attention and followed everyone&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw an eye-catching pink figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outfit, that aura was outstanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slim and Slender.</p>

                <p>The makeup was light but beautiful and elegant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her features were well defined and alluring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow face turned pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked presentable, yet simple and elegant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people could barely resist looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like an angel compared to the first girl in green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An Angel in a pink dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone suddenly realized that the girl was walking next to someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that Mr Bryan ?&#34; Someone asked in the crowd.</p>

                <p>&#34;I thought Flow was his fiancee, no?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The girl is so tall and beautiful, they looked compatible together&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, if i would choose between her and Miss Flow i would choose her of course&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, she took my breath away&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unfortunately, she is Mr Bryan girlfriend&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Discussions were ongoing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men sitting down beside Flow gasped as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They slowly took their leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow could feel judgments of comparison from all directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This bitch is seducing all the men with her innocent look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d thought she would look prettier than Sherry with her dress but the moment she walked in, she had lost to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow bit her lips and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked towards them with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother Bryan&#34; Flow smiled at Bryan gently but Bryan didn&#39;t even give her a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow bit her lips in embarrassment, people were watching them, so she thought Bryan would surely save her some face but he didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all this bitch&#39;s fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seduced Brother Bryan and whispered into his ears and told him not to talk to her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sister-in-law, you looked beautiful,&#34; Flow complimented her with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled and nodded, &#34;You don&#39;t look bad yourself&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t look bad?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t just want to admit that she looked beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow stared at Sherry pretty face, a vicious thought crossed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she destroyed her pretty face, would she become the most beautiful?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Brother Bryan would not like her anymore and divorce and marry her instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made up her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt a chill run through her spine, she rubbed her hand together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt herself get goosebumps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around but no one was looking at her in any bad way, except with jealousy and envy in their eyes while the men looked at her with admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away, not thinking about it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan put his hand on her waist and walked away from Flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow couldn&#39;t follow them even if she wanted to, if she followed them behind wouldn&#39;t she look like their servant instead?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Flow&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow heard someone called her from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow looked back and saw that it was her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow smiled gently when she saw her &#34;Janet, you are here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34; She looked towards Bryan and looked at Flow, &#34;who is the girl beside Brother Bryan? Are you not his fiancee?&#34; She asked because Flow told her she was engaged to Bryan when they were abroad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She became friends with Flow abroad, they met in school and became best friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow smiled wryly, &#34;I don&#39;t know why, Brother Bryan doesn&#39;t want to talk to me anymore since I came back from abroad,&#34; Flow said pitifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet became angry when she heard this, &#34;It must be that bitch who seduced him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated mistress since she was young because her mother died when her father brought his mistress home. Then her mother was diagnosed with kidney problem, she couldn&#39;t take it and died since then Janet had hated all mistresses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw that Sherry was now alone, she held Flow&#39;s hand and said, &#34;Let&#39;s go and meet her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow feigned panicking when she heard this and tried to draw Janet back, &#34;No let&#39;s not go so Brother Bryan won&#39;t misunderstand&#34; She said with a look of panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>38</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet smiled at her reassuringly, &#34;Don&#39;t worry i know what I&#39;m doing&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow smiled smugly when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph if anything happened, she won&#39;t be the one at fault but Janet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who asked her to want to protect her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sat down quietly waiting for Bryan, he left saying he had some business to attend to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was feeling a little bored when she heard an arrogant girl&#39;s voice behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard that you are Brother Bryan&#39;s new girlfriend, do you have what it takes to get married into the Tony family? You must be talented, i wish to you challenge you in music so we can exchange pointers, do i have the honor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said loudly so Sherry wouldn&#39;t be able to reject her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry turned around and didn&#39;t recognize her, she didn&#39;t know her at all but when she looked at the person standing beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone turned to that girl. She was wearing a blue gown and had a cocktail in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl glared at Sherry with disgust in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated the mistress alot so she hated Sherry immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faked a smile, &#34;I&#39;m Janet bullet&#34; she introduced herself to Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A commotion ensued the moment she said her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Janet Bullet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know her! She is the champion who won in Singapore music competition, she is very popular&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is right, i remembered her now too&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is just a little unfortunate that she doesn&#39;t want to become a musician with her voice I&#39;m sure she will become very popular&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is right, i heard she rejected a company who wanted to her sign with them saying she was not interested in music&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet kept her eyes on Sherry waiting for her reply patiently, ignoring the commotion that ensued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow grabbed her hands, &#34;Janet forgot it&#34; She said like she was trying to stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet ignored her and looked at Sherry with a provocative gaze, &#34;What? You don&#39;t dare?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was bored anyway. Besides, this was a good opportunity for her. She composed a birthday song for Grandma before this was her chance to sing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another commotion ensued immediately, she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This woman doesn&#39;t know her place&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems she doesn&#39;t know how many awards Miss Janet has received for her voice&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She should apologize to Miss Janet or she would be the one embarrassed&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmurs became louder. Many people were looking at Sherry with pity and ridicule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry ignored them like she doesn&#39;t see the ridicule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Begin first, Miss Janet&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet looked at her before turning and walking towards the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone came to give her the microphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet took it and started singing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was clear and it was good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People felt that she was talented as the rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she sang was neither too fast, slow or too loud nor too low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The song was rather light, livening up the atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone could tell that she was skilled and talented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone applauded her once she finished singing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a pretty Good voice,&#34; Sherry complimented her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet looked at her indifferently and handed her the microphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry took it and walked to the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleared her throat.</p>

                <p>Happy birthday, Grandma</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many people gathered around her now and they watched her with admiration in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s eyes were on her now. She had stolen the limelight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow looked at Sherry unwillingly and clenched her fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t expect Sherry to be so good at singing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at Janet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was really useless, she couldn&#39;t even beat that bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry left the stage after singing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are pretty talented&#34; Janet raised an eyebrow and complimented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loved people who can sing but she already had a bad impression of Sherry before so it is impossible for them to become friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks a lot, Granddaughter&#34; Grandma&#39;s voice suddenly echoed in the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was shocked when they heard her voice, because she had not arrived before so they didn&#39;t know when she arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma walked towards the stage, she waved her hand at Sherry for her to come closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stood up and walked towards her immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for coming to participate in the birthday, it is an honor&#34; Grandma said into the microphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The main purpose of this birthday is to introduce my granddaughter-in -law&#34; Grandma said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone gasped and looked at Sherry feeling shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Bryan is married to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, i can&#39;t believe that Mr Bryan is already married&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men felt a little sad, while the women looked at Sherry in envy, jealous and hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot of girls are heartbroken after hearing that the man they have been dating is married already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby Bryan,&#34; Grandma said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan walked towards them and stood beside Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma handed the microphone to him, Bryan accepted it and started, &#34;Hello everyone, this is my wife&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow face turned pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brother Bryan actually introduced that bitch to everyone as his wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, it was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was clinging on to the hope that if he didn&#39;t bring her to the party, that means he didn&#39;t love her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he actually brought her to the banquet and introduced her to everyone as his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Sherry with hatred in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could tear her apart, she would have done it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>39</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry yawned and stood up from the bed, she walked into the bathroom and showered before wearing some clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took her phone and checked for messages, she was shocked when she saw almost 50+ messages on her phone with missed calls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara sent her 20 messages while the rest are from some of her high school mates who don&#39;t talk to her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened Tara&#39;s message and started reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you are Mrs Tony?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, i can&#39;t believe that I&#39;m friend with the popular Tony&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey are you there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was thinking that man who came to pick you up when you were drunk looked familiar but i wasn&#39;t sure&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn, Girl i can&#39;t sleep&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled and started typing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply came quickly like she was waiting for her message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn, you are awake now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, when did you get married to Mr Tony?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is a month now&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sad, you didn&#39;t even tell you are married, are we still friends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s talk when we see, I&#39;ll explain to you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;m waiting for you in school&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scrolled through the other messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of them were &#34;Hi, hello, let&#39;s meet&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother to reply to any of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom or sis didn&#39;t call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom doesn&#39;t like watching news and Nancy also hates it, she prefers watching Chinese dramas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry put her phone into her bag and walked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t see anyone in the living room, so she walked out of the house and took a bike to school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she got to the school gate, Tara was already waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara immediately walked towards her and held her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are here&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked into the school together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They went to the cafeteria first because Sherry was hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now explain&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara said, Sherry started eating Tara was not eating because she already ate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is a fake marriage, &#39;&#39; Sherry said nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara gasped in disbelief, &#34;A fake marriage?&#34; She looked like she didn&#39;t believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded and took a sip of her water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did his Grandma know about it too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he just married me so his Grandma would not force him to marry the person he doesn&#39;t like, keep it a secret&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara nodded and put her hand on her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry finished eating so they stood up and walked to the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her course mates smiled at her, flattering her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pursed her lips and didn&#39;t talk to anyone..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The title is not hers in the first place and they would divorce in a month when they divorce the people trying to please her will be the one to step on her later so she doesn&#39;t care about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry went to sit down on her seat with Tara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lecturer walked into the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the morning lecture, they did an exam for the last two weeks and the results were out.. The lecturer announced the result to everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry got full marks in all the subjects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her course mates admired her more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was surrounded by many people, some tried to flatter her while some came to ask her questions they didn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, can you take a look at this question? I don&#39;t understand it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me see&#34; Sherry took the question and stared at it for a few seconds before quietly writing the complete solution step by step so the person can understand. Her handwriting was exceptionally beautiful just like her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave the solution to the person when she was done, &#34;Thank you &#34; the person thanked her sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not expect Sherry, who usually seemed aloof and indifferent, to be easy to get along with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The students came one by one after seeing that she was actually nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, i also don&#39;t understand this&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The students surrounded Sherry in a few minutes..  Only Vera was sitting down alone with two of her friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vera gritted her teeth in anger, &#34;She always seduce people wherever she goes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vera, you should not offend her, she is Mrs Tony now&#34; Katherine said casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vera became more angry when she heard this, &#34;What Mrs Tony? I&#39;m sure he is toying with her and would dump her soon&#34; her gentle face looked terrifying and vicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was supposed to belong but that bitch snatched her spotlight away, She was the best student before Sherry arrived She was flattered because of her powerful background and people always come to ask her questions when they don&#39;t understand but that bitch actually snatched all her crowns away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t take this lying down but she couldn&#39;t offend Sherry too because of the man behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at Sherry with jealousy in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snatched her man too!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always liked and wanted to be Mrs Tony, she actually became Mrs Tony!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No Sherry has crossed her boundary just because she is beautiful and a little intelligent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry answered all her course mates, her hand was sore by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara smiled at her and console her, &#34;Sorry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t solve the problem so their impression of her would change but because she was trying to help and nothing else, she doesn&#39;t care if their impression of her changed or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is their business not hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>School ended soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry and Tara walked out of the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked towards the gate together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry hailed a cab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave first&#34; Sherry smiled at Tara and waved at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara nodded and waved back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry got into the car and the driver drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going to visit her mom. It has been a while since she visited her because she was busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom didn&#39;t even try to call her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry gave a bitter smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one cared about her and she is already used to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind started to wander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All her mom cared about is money and it has always been like that since she was young, she thought she was busy that was why but it has always been like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure her mom didn&#39;t even remember her birthday date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was not like this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recalled when she was four years old, her father was still with them then. On her birthday, her mom and dad bought a teddy bear for her. She was asleep and when she woke up she heard them singing her a happy birthday song and gave her the teddy bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What changed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it because her father ran away with the savings and his mistress?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when she was bullied in school, she had no one to depend on.. She almost committed suicide out of frustration and Nancy was also young then, so they had to take care of each other with no one to depend on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also almost killed all her high school students who framed her by poisoning them Once they died she would not be framed again and would have a peaceful life right? Then they should just die She almost killed them, her mental health was bad and no one cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are here,&#34; the taximan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry snapped out of her thoughts, she paid the man and walked into her mom&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was quiet, she was a little surprised because her mom doesn&#39;t have anywhere she always goes to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked towards the backyard and was shocked by what she saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>40</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw Nancy with her ex boyfriend Steven, Steven was kneeling down and begging Nancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry opened her mouth and couldn&#39;t close, she tried to walk back like she was never there when her feet hit the door making a loud noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry frowned, she raised her head and looked at them They were also looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven&#39;s face flushed in embarrassment, he stood up from the floor feeling a little embarrassed that Sherry saw him in that state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nancy&#39;s face turned nasty when she saw Sherry, &#34;What are you doing here?&#34; She snapped at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t respond and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to seduce him again? Like you did before?&#34;, Nancy said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stopped and turned around, she looked at Nancy in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never seduced him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, i believe you&#34; Nancy gave her a mockery smile, she turned around and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nan-&#34; Steven tried to stop her, but she didn&#39;t even look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steven sighed in frustration and looked at Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t take her words to mind, she is in a bad mood&#34; Steven said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded and turned around, she walked out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already in a bad mood and didn&#39;t want to face her mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hailed a cab to Bryan house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Nancy were very close before, Sherry didn&#39;t know why Nancy loathed her now They were very close before like normal sisters but since Steven broke up with her after finding out that she cheated on him, she had loathed Sherry Sherry thought it was because Steven broke up with her so she was in a bad mood but it has been going on since then..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She treated her like she was an enemy and it made Sherry sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry paid the taxi man and got out of the car</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the house, it was not locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who knows when Sherry opened the door she was frightened by a tall figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful&#34; Seeing that Sherry was going to fall, Bryan reached out and grabbed Sherry&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was pulled directly into his arms, Sherry&#39;s nose hit Bryan&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt so painful that tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him with a wronged expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest was too strong, she felt like her nose would break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hurt?&#34; Bryan asked feeling a little amused at her wronged expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out and rubbed Sherry&#39;s nose gently like he was massaging it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt it was less painful and stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are so careless&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry glared at him with anger in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, it was her fault because she was frightened by his sudden appearance in the house and she was also absent minded but who asked his chest to be so hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry ignored him and walked towards the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan chuckled a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry walked faster when she heard his chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the room door and closed it with a &#39;bang&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down on the bed feeling a little tired. She rubbed her eye brow and yawned feeling sleepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body was aching and she didn&#39;t feel like standing up to take a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room door opened and someone entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She guessed that it was Bryan but was feeling too lazy to open her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt him lay down next to her, she didn&#39;t move and lay there motionlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt his breathing become heavier and it was near her ears so she opened her eyes with a frown on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he suddenly leaned towards her and kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a deep kiss, he was taking and taking with his kiss. Pushing his tongue into her mouth, he caught her soft and sweet tongue sucked on it and held her tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry trembled and felt her body become limp. She didn&#39;t have any energy to resist him and just allowed him to do whatever he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated kissing because she found it disgusting but she liked his kisses she doesn&#39;t understand why. So she tried to avoid him as far as she could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she still couldn&#39;t avoid him if they were living in the same room together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he released her, she was out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and felt like she would die out of suffocation because of his kisses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes also became heavy, she slept without knowing..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at his erected crotch and the heartless girl who had fallen asleep leaving him to his fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked into the bathroom and took a cold shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He can&#39;t count how many times he has taken a cold shower ever since they started sleeping in the same room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He has been single since he was young, he has never fallen in love with anyone before until he met that girl in high school who left a deep impression on his heart and he couldn&#39;t forget her since then, and he found her five years later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never believed in destiny, until he found out that Sherry was that girl, he believed that it was destiny who brought her back to him which made him happy All he had to do is to keep her by his side now, which he believed won&#39;t be hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked out of the bathroom and lay down by her side, he watched as Sherry shifted towards him and put her head on his chest before sleeping soundly again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled and hugged her to sleep too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Sherry woke up, Bryan was not inside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She woke up later because she didn&#39;t have lectures for that day but she still had to shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up from the bed and walked into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a hot shower because it was winter  She walked out of the bathroom and put on casual clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took her phone to check for messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw that she had fifteen missed call from Flow and twenty text messages from her. She didn&#39;t save her number but her memory was good so she remembered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the messages and started reading them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call me back&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pick up the call&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you not picking up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ignored and didn&#39;t want to call her back, she would call back if she had anything important to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to leave her phone on the bed when her phone rang immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry picked up and put the phone on her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you pick up since I&#39;ve been calling you?&#34; She heard Flow&#39;s irritated voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled closely when she heard her, she hated this kind of people so much, &#34;Miss Flow, i think this is my phone which i bought with my money right? You didn&#39;t buy the phone for me huh? I pick any call that i feel like picking and i don&#39;t pick up when i don&#39;t feel like&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow expressed turned ugly on the other side She clenched her jaw tightly and pinched her thigh to regain her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should calm down and she must achieve her goal of making the phone first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She repeated this in mind for a few times before forcing out a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry thought she didn&#39;t have anything to say anymore and was about to hang up when she heard her voice again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, Miss Sherry i was in a bad mood before, i hope you don&#39;t mind&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just tell me whatever you want to say&#34; Sherry said feeling a little disgusted by her sickening gentle voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we meet? I have something to tell you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Sherry agreed, feeling curious about what she wanted to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll text you the address later,&#34; Flow said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry hung up after saying this.</p>
