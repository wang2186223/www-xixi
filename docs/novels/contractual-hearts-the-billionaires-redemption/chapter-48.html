                <p>Bryan was sitting down in the living room, waiting for Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left the house because she was embarrassed and has not returned and it is getting late which is odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the time, she always stays at home and doesn&#39;t go out except when she has classes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took his phone and dialed her number but she didn&#39;t pick up. He looked at his phone and suddenly realized that he doesn&#39;t even know who to call that she always talks with. The only friend he has ever seen her with, he doesn&#39;t have her number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to call her again when a text message came into his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Beep&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan opened the text message and saw that it was from Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Can you come and save me? I think I&#39;m somewhere Universal street&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned when he saw the message, he quickly dialed Cornelius&#39; number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone rang and he picked at the second ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you calling me this time? Did your wife leave you?&#34; Cornelius said teasingly, seeming like he was gloating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me track her number. I need it now!&#34; Bryan said with a serious voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? She really left?&#34; Cornelius asked, he was already pressing his laptop furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cornelius!!&#34; Bryan growled in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius shivered when he heard his angry voice, his anger is very bad and no one would want to offend him when he is angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m already tracking it,&#34; Cornelius replied quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send me her location&#34; he said and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dialed a number on his phone again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Young Master&#34; The person picked at the first ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pick up five people from your team, And come here right now&#34; Bryan said and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wheeled himself out of the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin walked towards him immediately he saw him, &#34;Sir are you going somewhere?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t bother&#34; Bryan dismissed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin left quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five men walked towards him and bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young Master&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Cornelius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan picked up immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello bro, I have tracked her number. She is somewhere in Universal street, the deserted place,&#34; Cornelius said in a serious voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Universal street&#34; He told the men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They always follow him whenever he is going on a business trip or whenever something dangerous happens, they are well trained guards. His grandfather trained them. They became his bodyguards when he took over the company from his Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the men, Nicholas, opened the door for him, and helped him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went to the driver seat and started the car, the rest took another car and followed them behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got there in an hour, it was supposed to be an hour and thirty minutes journey but Bryan urged Nicholas to drive faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas parked at a car he saw first, he helped Bryan out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the bodyguards went to check the car, then he walked towards Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have checked the car, there is nothing amiss there but i found this phone&#34; He handed the phone to Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan accepted the phone and recognized it as Sherry&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is her phone&#34; He said and continued &#34;Three people should go to the left, While the rest should follow me&#34; Bryan commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three people left immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas pushed the wheelchair and they started walking towards the left direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got a place, there was left and right there and there was also an alley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One of you should go to the left,&#34; Bryan told one of the guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One left immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan pointed at the alley and ordered Nicholas to wheel him there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas pushed the wheelchair towards the alley without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The alley was dark but Bryan had sharp eyes so he could see a man figure pointing a gun at someone, Nicholas also saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took out his gun and fired at the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was shot at the shoulder, he fell and lost consciousness coupled with the stab Sherry stabbed him, he already felt weak too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan pushed himself towards her, anxious,  Nicholas turned on his phone flash light, the alley brightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was lying in a pool of blood, Bryan wheeled himself faster towards her, he got there but he couldn&#39;t check on her without standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gritted his teeth while trying to stand up, he sat down next to her and held her in his arms. By the time he finished, he was covered with cold sweat because of the wound in his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was so pale that her face was as white as a piece of paper. Breathing heavily, she was covered in cold sweat, her eyes were shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am in heaven?&#34; She asked and continued, &#34;Why am I hearing Bryan&#39;s voice too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan felt like laughing at her silliness, &#34;Little fool&#34; Bryan said, his voice was hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears fell down from her cheeks, making his heart tremble, &#34;So I&#39;m really in heaven&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her eyes with difficulty, the brightness of the room blind her eyes momentarily, she opened her eyes a little till she got used to the brightness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bryan? What are you doing in heaven too?&#34; She asked, her eyes were becoming heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t endure it anymore and closed her eyes, she fell unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry!!&#34; Bryan called his voice filled with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young Master, Young Madam is still breathing, she just fainted&#34; Nicholas quickly informed when he saw that his expression looks terrible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should we do then?&#34; Bryan asked foolishly, his mind was blank and he didn&#39;t even know what to do anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s take her to the hospital,&#34; Nicholas said immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, hospital&#34; Bryan said in realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas ordered one of the guards to help him to the wheelchair, he was about to carry Sherry in his arms when Bryan stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, don&#39;t carry, put her on my lap&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas&#39; mouth twitched when he heard him, is he still getting jealous in this situation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He obeyed him and put her on his lap, he is not interested in Sherry anyways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed Bryan out of the alley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards carried the man and followed them out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was pushed out to where the car was. The ambulance had already arrived, Bryan was not sure how he got into the ambulance and arrived at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just kept looking at Sherry, he would feel her nose to see if she was still breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got to the hospital and the nurse wheeled Sherry into the emergency room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was about to follow when he was stopped by the nurse, &#34;Sorry sir, you can&#39;t go in&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn&#34; Bryan cursed, the nurse was scared when he saw his angry expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man looked handsome but he was too terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young Master, let the doctors do their work&#34; Nicholas advised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He has been with Bryan since childhood, they grew up together and you could call them close friends.</p>
