                <p>She wasn&#39;t clean so it is normal for him to despise her for being dirty.. His puppy love should stop now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pushed him away while he was still in a trance and ran out of the room, Bryan snapped out of his daze and ran after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry!&#34; He yelled her name so she could wait.</p>

                <p>She believed that tears and love are weaknesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed her eyes solemnly and waited for the car to hit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Controlling her tears, she continued to run and run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw a car heading her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped and wanted to run away, but it was too late the car was already near her.. She stopped and waited for death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe her coming to this world was a mistake from the very beginning, maybe death would be a relief to her, everyone just despised her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry waited for the expected pain but none came, instead she heard a groan. She opened her eyes and turned around, shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was lying down in a pool of blood and the car that knocked him down already drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry kneeled down next to him, tears were already streaming from her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bryan&#34; She called, her voice was hoarse and low like she was afraid he wouldn&#39;t answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan opened his eyes and smiled at her, &#34;I never cared if you are virgin or not, i liked you not because you are a virgin or clean i just liked you okay&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded, tears kept falling down from her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time someone ever told her this.. This was the first time someone ever sacrificed himself for her, the first time someone ever told her he liked not because of anything just like her naturally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt like getting married to him for real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry held his arm, &#34;Don&#39;t talk anymore&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled, &#34;You have to take responsibility for me, my first time was with you, my first kiss, my first sex, my first hug and all intimate act, it was my first time with you, so you have to take responsibility for me, okay&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry avoided his gaze and tried to help him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me,&#34; Bryan said, coughing furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He coughed blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s face became pale when she saw him coughing out blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m waiting for your reply,&#34; Bryan said stubbornly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop talking and save your strength,&#34; Sherry said in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t talk after I hear your reply&#34; Bryan smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay fine, I&#39;ll take responsibility for you&#34; Sherry said to reassure him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled brightly, he suddenly felt that accident was worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have promised me,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I know&#34; Sherry interrupted him so he wouldn&#39;t say anything anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm&#34; Bryan said and was about to close his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry yelled at him, &#34;Don&#39;t you dare close your eyes! If you close your eyes I won&#39;t take responsibility for you&#34; She threatened him softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan chuckled when he heard her stern voice, &#34;Okay Madam&#34; He said teasingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ambulance arrived in a few minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt her heart start beating normally after the ambulance arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They quickly rushed him to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sat down outside while Bryan was pushed into the operation room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down and kept glancing at the emergency room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry!&#34; She heard someone call her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry turned around towards the hospital entrance and was stunned when she saw Bryan&#39;s Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately stood up and walked towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, what are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did she know that Bryan was hospitalized?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma Patted her back consoling her, &#34;Aunty Edge called me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry understood after Grandma said this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t see Aunty Edge when Bryan had an accident, maybe she was anxious and didn&#39;t look around properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pursed her lips and looked at her with guilt in her eyes &#34;Grandma, Bryan had the accident because of me. You don&#39;t blame me?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If he didn&#39;t do that, I would have reprimanded him for not doing that,&#34; Grandma said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry held her hand and led her to sit down on the seat she sat down before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt her heart warm when she heard what Grandma said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both sat down waiting for the emergency room door to open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The emergency room door finally opened, two doctors pushed Bryan out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry and Grandma immediately stood up and walked towards the doctors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is my Grandson?&#34; Grandma asked immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is alright, the operation was successful&#34; The doctor said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma and Sherry heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They pushed Bryan into a room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry allowed Grandma to sit down beside Bryan while she walked into the bathroom inside the room. She poured some water into a bowl and held a white towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the bathroom, she dipped the towel into the water and squeezed, then she gently wiped Bryan&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did it for a few more times before stopping after seeing that he was not covered with sweat anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood beside him and watched him intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw his finger twitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bryan?&#34; She whispered when she saw this and looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he awake?&#34; Grandma asked when she heard Sherry calling him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but I think his finger twitched. Maybe I saw it wrong&#34; Sherry said sadly, she suddenly missed him a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t know how to express her feelings anymore, she started hiding her feelings ever since she was betrayed and got used to it that she doesn&#39;t know how to express her feelings anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wanted to give it a shot again.</p>
