                <p>Bryan nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The killer was tied to a chair, he was awake now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he confess?&#34; Bryan asked the men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; they answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised his head and looked at him, &#34;Who sent you?&#34; Bryan asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man gave him a mockery smile, &#34;Even your men can&#39;t make me say the truth no talk of you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan lit a cigarette, he put it between his fingers, he narrowed his eyes at the man, making the man shiver subconsciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give him a shot,&#34; Bryan said to Nicholas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas nodded and walked towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-what do you want to do?&#34; The man looked at Nicholas warily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas didn&#39;t answer him, he took out an injection which was already prepared, and there is some liquid inside the injection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stabbed the man with an injection and pressed the liquid into his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man didn&#39;t feel anything when the content inside the injection was transferred into his body but he didn&#39;t dare to let his guard down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly felt his eyes were heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleeping pill?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was puzzled, his body felt heavy too before he knew he already closed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t fall asleep, he could hear everything going on around him but he couldn&#39;t open his eyes no matter how much he struggled, he couldn&#39;t even move his body, everything he could see was darkness but he could hear everything going on around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you can hear me,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice sounded like he was the devil himself, the man felt like he was in hell alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is real torture!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Can he give him a second chance? He would confess!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to move or open his mouth but he couldn&#39;t no matter how much he tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a chemical made from Brazil, i heard it is make for people like you who prove to be stubborn and doesn&#39;t want to confess, I&#39;m willing to let you enjoy it for the first for an hour, after an hour I&#39;ll give you the antidote but if you refuse to confess I&#39;ll let you continue living like this, you won&#39;t be able to live nor will you be able to die, this is the last chance&#34; Bryan said, his eyes twinkled with evil unlike the gentle expression he usually show Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man felt like he just gave him a death sentence, he would have to stay like this for an hour?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is too evil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wished he could turn back time and &#39;obediently&#39; confess but it is too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan took out his phone and read his emails silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 hour later..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his head from his phone and stared at Nicholas, &#34;Give me a shot&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicholas nodded, he walked towards the table and took another injection from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked towards the man and gave him a shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man tried to open his eyes and he succeeded, he felt happy but he was happy too soon when he saw Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready to confess?&#34; Bryan asked with a devilish smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man hesitated for a few seconds before he nod his head, &#34;Yes&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, I&#39;m listening,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man opened his mouth and started talking, &#34;I know this can sound ridiculous but i don&#39;t know the person who sent me&#34; The man said and looked at Bryan hesitatingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan chuckled, the man shivered in fear when he heard his laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems you are not ready to confess, Give him a shot and let him sleep forever&#34; He ordered Nicholas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!! Please don&#39;t! I&#39;ll confess, I swear I&#39;ll confess I&#39;ll tell you everything I know&#34; The man said fearfully, he looked at Bryan with pure fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The arrogance that was in his eyes before was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say something useful,&#34; Bryan said impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell you everything i know, i received a call from a man i don&#39;t know who he is but the man said i should rape and kill the woman, he transferred money into my account, $100,000&#34; The man said truthfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was sacred and thought he didn&#39;t believe him, &#34;I swear I&#39;m not lying, you can check my bank record&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, how did the man get your number and is that the work you are specialized in?&#34; Nicholas asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan didn&#39;t stop him because he also wanted to ask him the same question, Nicholas knew him too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know how he got my number and that is my train of work but i have never seen the man before, i only heard his voice on the phone&#34; The man said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Check his bank record&#34; Bryan told Nicholas and wheeled himself out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is a sleepless night for some people while some people are already on their bed dreaming and sleeping leisurely. Sherry was already sleeping and dreaming that she became the richest woman in the world while those who can&#39;t sleep an example is Flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow paced in her room anxiously looking at her phone every second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally her phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up immediately and put the phone on her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, how is it? Is she dead?&#34; Flow asked anxiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling happy and anxious too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, the guy was caught,&#34; a man &#39;s voice said on the other side of the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow expressions changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That bitch is really lucky, did he manage to rape her?&#34; Flow asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she was rescued before he can do anything to her&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow cursed and threw the vase of flowers beside her on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crash!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made a noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knock!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby girl, are you alright?&#34; A woman asked from outside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow took a deep breath and calmed down a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I&#39;m fine it was a mistake&#34; She replied in a normal voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I ask Anna ( The househelp) to come and clean it up?&#34; Her mom asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I&#39;ll call her later&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take care and don&#39;t get hurt&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making sure that she had walked away, Flow said on the phone, &#34;Will it be traced back to me?&#34; She asked calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, i didn&#39;t leave traces, even the bank i used to transfer the money to him was hacked by a friend&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, thank you I&#39;ll send the rest of your money but is the guy still alive ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes he should still be alive but he was caught already so they will kill him anyway&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow hangs up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bitch is really lucky but if it doesn&#39;t work today, it doesn&#39;t mean that it will not work tomorrow or any other day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to do it but she refused to divorce Bryan, if she can&#39;t make her leave willingly and peacefully she would make her leave by force.</p>
