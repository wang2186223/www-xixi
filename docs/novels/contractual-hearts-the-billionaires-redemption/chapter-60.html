                <p>Sometimes she always wondered if he was her real father, because no father would ever do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They roamed about three years with no house to stay. Her mom&#39;s friends also left her when she encountered a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reason she believed that everyone is a hypocrite was based on her experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had to seek refuge in some places, till her mom gathered enough money and leased a house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leasing a house, she started traveling for weeks, sometimes months, so she basically grew up alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And no one was there to monitor her or care for her when she was sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The love she didn&#39;t get from her parents, that was what made her fall for those jerks she fell for before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you thinking?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has been looking at the hospital ceiling since she opened her eyes, deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had called her more than five times but she didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry snapped out of her thought and stared at him, &#34;Why are we at the hospital again?&#34; She asked with a displeased expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised an eyebrow at her displeased expression, &#34;You don&#39;t remember anything? You passed out in the bathroom scaring the shit out of me, now you are blaming me for bringing you to the hospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you should have&#34; Sherry stopped talking once she saw his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to tell him that he should have left her and that she would wake up herself no need to bring her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised an eyebrow for her to continue her words, but Sherry put a hand on her mouth and didn&#39;t say anything further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time to use your medicine, the doctor said you should use it once you wake up&#34; Bryan said and brought out some of the drugs he bought at the pharmacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s expression froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought it had all ended but she still had to take drugs?!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahem I have not woken up yet, I&#39;m still feeling sleepy&#34; She said with a yawn and acted like she was feeling sleepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, you will take it once you wake up&#34; Bryan said with an amused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry action froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Bryan with a pitiful face, &#34;I think I&#39;m feeling okay now, so there is no need for me to take it besides I&#39;m not feeling any pain in my stomach&#34; Sherry lied without batting an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach was starting to hurt but she doesn&#39;t want to take drugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What should she do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you have to take it, it is for your good. The doctor asked you to take it. You took a lot of cold foods and sweet things right?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry raised her head and looked at him in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>H-how did he know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never told anyone that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H-how d-did you know?&#34; She asked in an agitated voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was shocked when her voice turned agitated, He raised an eyebrow. &#34;The doctor told me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t read all the information about her in the investigation Cornelius did, because he wanted her to tell him herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry calmed down after hearing his answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is right!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor would find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he didn&#39;t find out the silly things she did when she was young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart calmed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; She muttered and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stretched his hand and handed her the medicine in his hand. Sherry took it and smelled it, she turned her face away in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was amused when he saw her disgusted expression but he acted like he didn&#39;t notice it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He poured her water into the glass and handed it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are the names of these drugs?&#34; Sherry asked as she accepted the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was looking for ways to dispose of it without him noticing her movement so she tried to engage him in a conversation to distract him. Hopefully she hoped her plan would work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), at regular doses starting the day before you expect your period to begin can help control the pain of cramps. Prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also are there and you can also use them when you are on your period, so quickly use it&#34; Bryan said not understanding her what she is trying to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s eyes widened in shock, &#34;So many drugs? Did the doctor want me to die?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure she would die before she finished using the drugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There are so many drugs!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She now understands why they are so much in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She counted them and it was five drugs in total.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>5 drugs!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn she had never used so much drugs like this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised an eyebrow at her expression, &#34;It is good for your health so it won&#39;t kill you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shook her head, &#34;No no&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doesn&#39;t understand her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drugs are too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she doesn&#39;t know how she can dispose of all of them without arousing his suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn! Who the heck prescribed these drugs to you?&#34; Sherry asked in a frustrated tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person is obviously after her life!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the reason why she hates doctors!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quickly use it, or do you want me to feed you?&#34; Bryan said with threat in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shook her head, &#34;No No I&#39;ll take it myself&#34; Sherry forced out a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled, &#34;Good girl quickly take it&#34; He said and watched intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could understand that she hates drugs from the way she was acting since and the other day at the hospital too she was reluctant to take it that day also he had to force it before she finally took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sighed at her bad luck. He was watching her carefully now so she doesn&#39;t have ways to dispose of the drugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held her breath and put the drugs in her mouth. She quickly drank a lot of water so the bitterness in her mouth would wash away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have taken it&#34; She looked at him. She looked like he just finished bullying her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If people saw her they would think he was really bullying her but she was the one who was reluctant to take medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good girl, you will take it tomorrow too&#34; Bryan said with an amused expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She will take it tomorrow also!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is bad!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she just had to take it today and that is all who knows that she will have to take it again tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression turned sullen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly had an idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she flush all the drugs with water she would not have to take it right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is so brilliant!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled at herself, her expression showed her happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised an eyebrow, one minute she was feeling sullen the next moment she was feeling happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is she planning this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine I&#39;ll take it since it is good for my health&#34; Sherry said and feeling giddy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t wait to dispose of the medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan was shocked when she said this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was reluctant to take the medicine just now but she agreed readily to take it tomorrow?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doesn&#39;t believe that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must be planning something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at her body and saw that the clothes she was wearing was different from the one she wore today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are my clothes?&#34; She raised her head and looked at him in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan replied, &#34;I have washed them&#34;</p>
