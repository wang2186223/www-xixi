                <p>Sherry was shocked when she heard her song playing out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You.. How did you find this?&#34; She stuttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan grinned, &#34;I saw it coincidentally when I was washing your clothes, I was curious about what it was so I took it. I love it when i listened to the music, Thank you I&#39;ll cherish it&#34;</p>

                <p>Did he think I composed the music for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t say anything and let him continue misunderstanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That is right!</p>

                <p>Sherry turned around and looked at him, confused. He got down and turned around to her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Oh&#39; Sherry muttered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked into the mall hand in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salesperson walked over very quickly, &#34;Good day sir/ Miss, Welcome to our mall. What types of clothes do you wish to buy? Do you have any design in mind?&#34; The salesperson asked enthusiastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shook her head, &#34;I&#39;ll look around&#34; She replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay&#34; The salesperson nodded and made way for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked into the mall with the salesperson following them behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a new arrival at our store. I&#39;m sure it would look splendid on you&#34; The salesperson pointed at a gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at the gown, she looked at it immediately she saw it. She checked the price tag and quickly canceled it from her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The price is too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stingy person like her can&#39;t afford it, even if she can afford it she doesn&#39;t want to buy it. She would rather use the money to invest in stock and make profit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salesperson saw that Sherry liked it so she asked, &#34;Should I wrap it up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shook her head, &#34;No i don&#39;t like it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan also saw that she liked it, &#34;Take it down, let her wear it,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salesperson was elated, &#34;Yes&#34; She quickly took out the gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was reluctant and held his hand, &#34;But i don&#39;t like it&#34; She pursed her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salesperson handed the gown to Sherry and held her to the changing room before she could decline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry could only helplessly change into the gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the changing room after she was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salesperson and Bryan were shocked when she walked out of the changing room, she looked like an angel with the white gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look so beautiful,&#34; The salesperson said sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wrap it up,&#34; Bryan said immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry held Bryan&#39;s hand and looked at him with pleading gaze, she said in a low tone, &#34;The gown is too expensive&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you like it&#34; Bryan said and looked the way she looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t mean you should waste money to buy it,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She can&#39;t spend money the way Bryan did, she is poor to begin with. She only has a few billionaires in her cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? You don&#39;t want to spend my money?&#34; Bryan raised an eyebrow at her pitiful expression, he continued, &#34;All my money is for you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So can I spend it any way I like?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry felt her heart ache with the money he was about to pay for the gown, she doesn&#39;t understand how the rich thinks, she knew it was not easy to earn money because she started working at the age of 15 sometimes when student are in school, she will go to her workplace to raise money and pay her school fees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is not easy to earn money but Bryan made it look like it was the easiest thing to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pursed her lips, she didn&#39;t say anything anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The gown is enough, let&#39;s go,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t want him to waste more money buying clothes or shoes for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No let&#39;s go&#34; Bryan held her hand and led her to another section which was where the bags were being displayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s eyes lit up when she saw a bag, she looked at the price tag and quickly stopped looking at it so Bryan wouldn&#39;t notice that she liked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why are things in this mall so expensive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure that if she was alone she wouldn&#39;t buy anything from this mall. It is so expensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you see anything you like?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry quickly shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan raised an eyebrow and called the salesperson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salesperson quickly approached them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wrap all the bags for me,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry gasped and looked at him shocked, &#34;Why? Do you want to give it to someone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan chuckled, &#34;No they belong to you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I don&#39;t like them,&#34; Sherry retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Choose the one you like or I&#39;m buying everything&#34; Bryan said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34; Sherry looked at him in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan turned towards the salesperson and said &#34;Wrap everything&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn! Wait I&#39;ll choose the one i like&#34; Sherry surrendered and chose the first bag she liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is all?&#34; Bryan raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought they said women loved shopping a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Sherry nodded and looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; He narrowed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; Sherry nodded again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn! Her heart was already aching with the money he just wasted on a bag and gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure that if she went to another store, she would see a gown or bag more beautiful than this and the price would be lesser too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded and held her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salesperson quickly wrapped the gown and bag, she stretched her hand to give it to Sherry but Bryan collected it before Sherry could take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took out his card and handed it to the salesperson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The salesperson quickly swiped the card and gave it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Patronize us again,&#34; The salesperson said, her voice sounding happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Never&#39; Sherry thought.</p>
