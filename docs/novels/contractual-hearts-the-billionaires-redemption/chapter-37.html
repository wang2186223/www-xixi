                <p>Sherry got out of the taxi, she turned around and looked at the cafe Flow sent to her for them to meet. She walked into the cafe and looked around, she saw Flow already waiting for her at the window side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry walked towards her and sat down on the chair across from her, she thought Flow would burst out of anger when she saw her because she let her wait for her for two hours. She was surprised when she didn&#39;t show any sign of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow was feeling so angry that she almost snapped at Sherry when she arrived but she held it in because of her purpose of calling her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pinched her thigh twice so she could calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up and stared at Sherry with a smile, &#34;What would you like to drink?&#34;</p>

                <p>Flow called the waiter and ordered a coffee for her. The waiter brought the coffee within ten minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them were silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stirred the coffee in front of her but she did not drink it. Flow took a sip of her freshly squeezed juice and sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry waited patiently for her to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow finally raised her head and stared at Sherry, &#34;Miss Sherry, how much do you need to divorce Brother Bryan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry: &#34;..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stared at her like she was contemplating on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much? Bryan is richer and more powerful than you, so what will I choose between a peanut change and a gold?&#34; Sherry stared at her like a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not sure how powerful or rich Bryan is, but seeing how people were trying to flatter her, she could guess that he is very rich.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow could not stand that look from Sherry and lost her calm, she took out her cheque book and dropped it in front of Sherry angrily, &#34;Write a figure&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was happy, anything that involves money makes her happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished that all the rich bosses of the company could come to her for them to sign a contract so whenever a girl who is a dumb as Flow liked them she could come and offer her, she will become rich instantly no?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled and looked like she was hesitating, &#34;Any figure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow looked at her with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected she is after Brother Bryan&#39;s money She made up her mind to call Bryan after Sherry leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow shook her head, &#34;From one million dollars to twenty million dollars&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Free money just to leave him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without her doing anything she is getting free money. She would divorce Bryan in a month anyway so it is a win to win case but she would make sure to collect more than that from her since she doesn&#39;t know what to use money for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph, she would just treat Flow money as an extra bonus anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled, &#34;Is that all your Brother Bryan worths?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow was pissed off and became furious, &#34;Don&#39;t be greedy&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry glanced at her sympathetically and sighed, &#34;It seems Miss Flow is not ready to do business&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said and tried to stand up to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow gritted her teeth, &#34;Wait!&#34; Flow said her heart was full of panic How would she make Brother Bryan able to see her true color if she leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Choose ten million dollars to twenty million dollars, that is the last i can do&#34; Flow stared at her with disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shook her head, &#34;Miss Flow, is that all your Brother Bryan worth? Besides, I can easily ask him for these peanuts you are offering me, no?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow pursues her lips and knows that she is right, she can easily ask Brother Bryan for money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much do you want?&#34; Flow asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;100 million dollars, deal or no deal?&#34; Sherry said, she didn&#39;t bother to sit down and stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow was furious when she heard this, &#34;You You are too greedy&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry ignored her angry expression, &#34;Deal or no deal!&#34; She repeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You..&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry turned around and acted like she was leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could hear Flow gritting her teeth, &#34;Deal!&#34; Flow said before she leaves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph, she was the one offering her free money anyways so she wasn&#39;t at fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry turned around and smiled at Flow brightly, &#34;Now you are talking&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow glared at angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Transfer or&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Transfer&#34; Sherry interrupted her immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry gave her her account number. Flow transferred the money to her instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all her savings for a year, she felt her heart ache but thinking of when she would become Mrs Tony and get more than that from Brother Bryan, her heart calmed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you are after Brother Bryan, bitch&#34; Flow spat with anger in eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t rebut her and acted unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow didn&#39;t lie in the first place she was after Bryan&#39;s money, if not she would not have signed a contract marriage with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When will you divorce him?&#34; Flow asked, feeling a little angry when Sherry ignored her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A month,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is too much, divorce him in a week&#34; Flow demanded angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shrug and looked at like an idiot, &#34;You can go and meet him to divorce him or wait for a month, your choice&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow glared at Sherry feeling pissed off, &#34;Fine a month it is. I&#39;ll be waiting&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry walked out of the cafe without saying goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow didn&#39;t care about her bye and screenshotted the money she transferred to Sherry, she sent Bryan a message with the transfer as evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother Bryan, i decided to test if sister-in-law is sincere with you or not but i realized that she was after your money, i transferred 100 million dollars to her so she could leave you and she agreed to&#34; She clicked on send and also sent the clip of the conversation between Sherry and her as evidence, she started recording it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry knew that Flow would likely tell Bryan but she doesn&#39;t care about that. She took out her phone and logged into her stock account She looked at Rainbow stock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It has been rising for two days now. She regretted not buying it if she knew that Rainbow is owned by Bryan ever since the day he announced her as his wife the company stock has been rising, if she had known she would have bought it but it was not too late anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bought the company stock worth of 50 million dollars, she was sure her earnings will be doubled or thrice of it by tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, we are here&#34; The taxi driver said when he saw that Sherry was engrossed on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked out of the window immediately and saw that they had really got to Bryan gate, she gave the driver an apologetic smile before paying him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got out of the car and walked into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was locked, so she took out the house key and opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one was at home, Aunty Edge was also not around. Sherry walked towards the elevator She walked into Bryan&#39;s room where she had been sleeping ever since Aunty Edge came to stay with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She changed into a towel and walked into the bathroom to take a shower. She walked out of the bathroom after she was done with the shower with a towel since she was alone. If Bryan was at home she would take her clothes to the bathroom and change once she was done with the shower inside the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was cleaning her body with a towel when the room door suddenly opened.</p>
