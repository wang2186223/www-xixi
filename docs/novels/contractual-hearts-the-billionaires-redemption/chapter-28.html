                <p>&#34;Good morning, Aunty Edge&#34; Sherry greeted her and sat down on the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning Young Madam, how was your night? Breakfast is ready&#34; Aunty Edge said and glanced at her meaningfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed when she saw her gaze, she felt a little embarrassed when she remembered last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is rare to get a kiss from a handsome hunk, so she decided to cherish the months of the contract marriage, after it ends, he wouldn&#39;t belong to her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan walked out of the elevator, putting on a white suit. He looked so handsome that her heart started beating fast again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked towards the dining room and sat down beside Sherry, Aunty Edge served the food when Bryan sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started eating, Sherry looked up and stared at him, she realized that his eating pace was neither too fast nor too slow, he looked dignified and calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unknowingly, Sherry stole a few more glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing it, Bryan raised his head and met her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were like the ocean, it looked like it would suck her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart fluttered, she quickly lowered her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her teacup to take a sip as her heart raced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You liked what you see?&#34; Bryan raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry choked on her tea when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He patted her back lightly, &#34;Are you a baby? You even choke on tea?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry coughed more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all his fault, who asked him to be so handsome?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they finished eating, Sherry stood up from her chair, &#34;I&#39;ll leave first&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll drop you off&#34; Bryan also stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry bit her lips and followed him unwillingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning Young Madam&#34; Calvin greeted her and opened the door for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning&#34; Sherry thanked him with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got into the car, Bryan sat down next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked out of the window, still feeling a little embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard something like someone was tapping his leg on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around and stared at Bryan, his eyes were closed so Sherry decided to admire him more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes and stared at her.. She was about to look away when he suddenly cupped her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The softness of his lips against her mouth got her heart pounding wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She widened her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a familiar scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clean and refreshing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loved his scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something tightened around her waist as her body was pressed against his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tongue worked around hers skillfully and his huge palm was supporting her waist. There was no room for her to escape his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin looked at them from the rearview mirror and was a little surprised when he saw this. He quickly turned his eyes back and pretended nothing was happening at the backseat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry on the other hand&#39;s mind was blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea how to react to this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The force around her waist was strong. She could feel his heart pounding too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His kisses were domineering and powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry tried to push him away but the more she struggled the tighter he wrapped his arm around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she decided to enjoy this, is this not too frequent?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Sherry felt that she was about to faint, he finally let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>looked at his chest right before her, and took a while to snap back to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately pushed him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34; She stammered, she was a little flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin cleared his throat, &#34;Young Madam we are at your school gate&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked out and realized that they were really there, she didn&#39;t even realize that the car had stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at him, his eyes were on her as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes looked so gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart fluttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly opened the car door and ran out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan looked at her fleeing figure with a smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like he was in a good mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To the company&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart was pounding fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She touched her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so hot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah.. So embarrassing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know why she was feeling like this towards him But she felt as though she liked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True! Who won&#39;t fall for a handsome hunk like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and suppressed her emotions before walking into her school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into her class and sat down beside Tara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to you? Are you alright?&#34; Tara asked, a little worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry shook her head, &#34;I&#39;m fine, why do you ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your face is red, are you sure you are alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry touched her face, &#34;Is it very red?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not very red but it is red&#34; Tara said as she stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I&#39;m fine,&#34; Sherry said dismissively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning class started shortly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lecture lasted for two hours before it finally ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sat down in her seat quietly, it was time for leisure but she doesn&#39;t feel like walking around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara walked out of the class after the morning class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sat down scrolling through Instagram quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly heard Tara called, Sherry raised her head and stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, let&#39;s go take a walk&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked around and realized that she was the only one inside the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed and stood up from her seat, she walked towards Tara as they walked out of the class together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry then realized that she forgot something inside the class, &#34;Go on I&#39;ll come to you i forgot to something inside the class&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okie dokie, I&#39;ll be waiting for you&#34; Tara nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded and walked back into the class, she was about to enter the class when she saw a girl inside the class she was putting something into her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry quickly hid in a place and took out her phone, she recorded everything the girl did on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl soon walked out of the class, Sherry walked into the class and opened her bag, she saw a necklace there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smirked when she saw this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out the necklace and put it on the girl&#39;s bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew who the girl was, she was one of Vera&#39;s dogs, she was also the one inside the washroom room with Vera plotting against her.</p>
