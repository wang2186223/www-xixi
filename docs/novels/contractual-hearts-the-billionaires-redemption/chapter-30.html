                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t take it, believe me Vera,&#34; Matilda said fearfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vera glanced at her with disgust in her eyes, if not because she would be useful to her in the future she would not save her and say she stole her necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I know, I forgot it in your bag yesterday,&#34; Vera smiled at her gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matilda was grateful when she heard this, she made the right choice by being friends with Vera, she knew some people would abandon her if it happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came from a poor background, she doesn&#39;t even have money to eat. Sometimes she became friends with Vera because of her background and Vera always gave her money sometimes so she always helped Vera with whatever she asked her to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she became labeled a thief she would get suspended and she wouldn&#39;t be able to participate in some things because the school would never allow a thief to participate in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was lucky enough that she got admission to the school in the first place, she got a scholarship to the school. She was very intelligent in high school but she indulged in being friends with Vera so she doesn&#39;t worry about her education anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, thank you Vera&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay it was a false alarm&#34; The lecturer said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lecturer started teaching them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry also focused on the lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lecturer soon finished the class, he walked out of the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry took her bag and was about to stand up when Tara asked, &#34;Uhm Sherry, do you have anything you want to go and do at home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, why?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about we go shopping?&#34; Tara asked, afraid that Sherry would reject her, she quickly added, &#34;I just want to buy a gift for someone but I don&#39;t know what to buy,&#34; Tara said and lowered her head pitifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled, &#34;Okay&#34; she agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yaay!&#34; Tara said happily when she agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly carried her bag and they walked out of the class together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hailed a taxi once they got to the school gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry showed the video of when Matilda was putting the necklace in her bag to Tara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara was shocked when she saw this, &#34;So that bitch did it!&#34; Tara exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;mm&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara looked at Sherry oddly, &#34;Are you not afraid that I&#39;ll betray you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter, you will not be first non the last who will&#34; Sherry shrugged indifferently and added, &#34;but i only give people chance once, i don&#39;t give people chance thrice and i showed it to you because i counted you as my friend now&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never betray you,&#34; Tara said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I hope so&#39; Sherry said in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They soon get to the shopping mall. They paid the taxi man and walked into the mall..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you buying the gift for?&#34; Sherry asked Tara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mom&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay&#34; Sherry nodded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An attendant quickly went over and said, &#34;Hello Beautiful Misses, how can I help you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at her and said, &#34;A birthday gift for a middle aged woman&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant heard her and first looked at the clothes that they were wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clothes that both of them were putting on were beautiful but it was cheap and the things inside the mall were ten times more expensive than what they were wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clothes they were wearing looked average and were a far cry from the rich ladies she always saw in their mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The clothes inside are ten times expensive and we don&#39;t sell cheap things too&#34; The attendant looked at them with disdain in her eyes, she thought they were rich young ladies but after observing their clothes she was sure they can&#39;t afford anything in the store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You looked down on people without knowing who they are,&#34; Tara scolded her immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I wish you a safe journey and please don&#39;t touch anything you can&#39;t afford to pay once you damage it&#34; The attendant said and walked away arrogantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is so rude,&#34; Tara complained when she saw the attendant&#39;s poor attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant went to seat down beside her colleague, she whispered, &#34;Keep an eye on them&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? What are they doing?&#34; The sales attendant asked, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are probably just looking around and will leave soon&#34; The attendant said and added, &#34;if she destroyed anything in the mall they would blame us so we wouldn&#39;t be blamed&#34; The attendant warned her colleague.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was loud enough that Sherry and Tara could hear her clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry ignored her and walked towards the mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of gift do you want?&#34; Sherry asked Tara who was about to lose her temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; Tara bit her lower lips a little lost..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gown caught Sherry&#39;s attention, and she walked towards the gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It has beautiful gems and the workmanship was excellent and the color made it look splendid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a nice shade of purple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would look good for a middle aged woman..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant came forward immediately when she saw Sherry looking at the gown intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry told her, &#34;Take this out for me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant frowned immediately when she heard this, &#34;The gown is very expensive and the gems on the gown are worth millions&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t see a price tag there so she raised an eyebrow when she heard this, &#34;How expensive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is very expensive, so expensive&#34; The attendant said exaggeratingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Name a figure,&#34; Sherry said impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ten million dollars, can you afford that?&#34; The attendant looked at her with a smug face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it is so expensive&#34; Sherry mimicked the attendant tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34; The attendant faced turned red in anger, &#34;You should leave emeralds that are very fragile. If you spoil it with your touch, can you afford the compensation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it out, i want to see it&#34; Sherry ignored the attendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You, Hmph you won&#39;t leave until you spend all your life savings huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara was already trembling from anger at the attendant&#39;s arrogant behavior, &#34;Tsk tsk you are only an attendant yet you are this arrogant huh? Does your owner know that this is how you treat customers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant was shocked and a little frightened when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Does she know the manager?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant looked at her clothes and rejected the idea immediately it popped into her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She can&#39;t know the manager given the way she dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She became fearless again, &#34;Hmph, you can go report to the manager that is if he will see you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems your manager didn&#39;t know that this is the way you treat customers, who knows how many customers you have chased out with your behavior&#34; Tara glared at the attendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what? Our manager doesn&#39;t ask us to entertain people like you, our mall is only for rich people not beggars like you&#34; The attendant said righteously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh wow, I have video of this and I&#39;ll post it on social media so people can see the way you treat customers&#34; Tara lied.. She was holding her phone like she was really recording it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant was frightened when she heard this, &#34;You Bring your card and pay&#34; The attendant glared at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would see if they could afford to pay for the gown, she is waiting for them to make a fool of themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was about to bring out her card when she heard a familiar voice behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hehe, A girl whose mother is a poor single mother would be able to buy a gown of ten million dollars?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry froze when she heard the familiar voice she hated so much.</p>
