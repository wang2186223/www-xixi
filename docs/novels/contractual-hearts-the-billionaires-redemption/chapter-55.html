                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, you just think about calling me, so unfair Hoes before bros I also want to have a boyfriend, sigh&#34; Tara lamented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; Sherry apologized, even though she apologized her voice was sarcastic, &#34;You can&#39;t understand since you are single&#34; Sherry teased her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So unfair to single people, my heart just broke but i made an improvement at least i am not a virgin anymore&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry sat up immediately when she heard this,  &#34;You really did it yesterday?&#34; She asked in disbelief, she thought she was just joking last night but she actually did it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah with a male escort so and i paid him too&#34; Tara said in a nonchalant voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, you are so courageous&#34; Sherry praised her sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s change topic, when are you resuming school? You took a week leave but you used two weeks or more at home&#34;</p>

                <p>She never told Tara that she got married to Bryan legally nor did she tell her everything that happened about Bryan&#39;s accident. She was already used to keeping things to herself so she didn&#39;t tell her anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay let&#39;s talk later, my body is aching&#34; Tara said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry bid her goodbye and hang up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry yawned and lay down on the bed to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell asleep in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry groaned from her sleep because of the bright sunlight that was coming from the window and was hitting her face. She couldn&#39;t sleep anymore even if she wants to because of the sunlight, she yawned and tried to stretch her arms but she couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned and opened her eyes in a daze and saw Bryan who was hugging her. He was still asleep because his eyes were closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s lips curled up at the amazing view of him. His hair was messy but he still looked cute and seductive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked so sexy even while sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How can he look so sexy while sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So unfair to average looking people like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt like he was trying to seduce her, she tried to wriggled to get out of his embrace but he pulled her closer and hugged her tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grunted in his sleep and opened his eyes. &#34;How was your sleep?&#34; He asked in his raspy voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry yawned, &#34;Good&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her body, &#34;What about your body?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry thought he was concerned about her body so she reassured him, &#34;I&#39;m fine&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he flipped and lay down on top of her. Sherry eyes widened in shock, &#34;W-what are you trying to do?&#34; She stuttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please not again! She bemoaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t seduce him or something right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled widened when he saw her shock state, &#34;Your body is fine? Then you should be able to do one round, Mm?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry put on a pained expression, &#34;No my body is still sore&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled, &#34;Fine I&#39;ll let you off today&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was trying to tease her before he also knew that her body couldn&#39;t take so much, he rolled back to his side to avoid himself from loosing control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry flee into the bathroom once he released her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan chuckled when he saw how fast she ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry took a shower and walked out of the bathroom, Bryan was not inside the room when she came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her closet and saw that some of her clothes were there, it was neatly washed and even ironed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forgot to ask him yesterday about where her clothes was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a pair of jeans and a white shirt and walked out of the room..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the living room and saw him putting food in the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The aroma of the food made her hungry, she was not feeling hungry before but she suddenly felt hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was always too lazy to cook so she would rather order takeout or go and eat in a restaurant, even her clothes she always wash them on a washing machine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her life now was so nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished it could go on like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she doubt it, her life was never smooth sailing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan turned around and saw Sherry looking in a daze, &#34;What are you doing standing there?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry snapped out of her daze and smiled at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Smells delicious&#34; She said and hopped towards the dining room. She couldn&#39;t wait to eat the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan sat down opposite her, they started eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They finished eating in forty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry then remembered something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm Where are my clothes?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I washed them, they were dirty&#34; Bryan answered nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry opened her mouth in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>H-he washed them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Has he ever done that before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know that he could even cook until yesterday, she thought he was used to being served not the other way round, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you look surprised?&#34; Bryan asked in a calm voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-you can wash clothes? L-like w-ith ha-nd?&#34; Sherry stuttered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she tell this to someone they would probably never believed her, a whole CEO of a company is washing clothes for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought that men always have this mentality about women are for the kitchen, it is their responsibility to take care of the house, wash clothes and prepare dishes etc that their responsibility is just to make money for them. But Bryan opened her eyes that some men could do anything as far as they loved the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, i usually do this when i was in school, there was no one to serve me i do things myself&#34; Bryan shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh&#34; Sherry muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would never leave this man, as far he doesn&#39;t do anything bad or cheat on her, she doesn&#39;t like sharing her man so he could only be hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go shopping today&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll follow you&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Won&#39;t you feel bored?&#34; Sherry asked him with her brow raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man has never accompanied her to shop before, this will be the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope, as far as you are with me, i won&#39;t feel bored&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blushed and felt a little delighted when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay let&#39;s go&#34; Bryan said and they walked out of the living room together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the car door for her and closed the car gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he treated her like a princess the more scared she became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered how long it would last?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan opened the car door and sat down next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started the car and drove out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan turned on the music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A song started playing out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the song she composed when she was still in love and naive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She composed the song when she was framed and sang it to Jackson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The title is NEED YOU</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What they are saying doesn&#39;t matter</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t listen to them, we don&#39;t need rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know you need me but I need you more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lover!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anytime you call me baby, you know that it makes me lose control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I want to love you like I have never loved before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lover.</p>

                <p>Because there is no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only happens once in life.</p>

                <p>But in my song you are my melody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You only can be there for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I need you now more than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second song is LIKE I DO.</p>
