                <p>Since she would be leaving the house today, she took a bath, changed her clothes, and then began packing her luggage.</p>

                <p>Sherry instantly hung up.</p>

                <p>One man walked out of the car and approached her, he tried to take her bags from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at the man&#39;s face and clicked her tongue inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man look is so-so</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was average looking, But whatever the marriage won&#39;t last anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Bryan?&#34; She asked the man even though she already determined in her mind that the man was her employer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man smiled sheepishly when she realized the mistake Sherry made. &#34;Young Madam, you are mistaken, I&#39;m Calvin the driver. Sir is in the car&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry gave the man an embarrassing smile and touched her nose to cover her awkwardness &#34;Oh&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave the man her bags and walked behind the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a little curious about her employer&#39;s look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin put her bags in the car trunk and walked to the driver seat, he was about to enter the car when he realized that Sherry hadn&#39;t entered the car yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was feeling a little lost. She didn&#39;t know where she should sit down. Should she sit beside the driver or at the back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only look at Calvin for help, she read about some male leads in a novel whereby the male hated women touching him and didn&#39;t sit beside women. She doesn&#39;t want to embarrass herself by sitting at the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin sighed in frustration when he saw this, he could only turn around,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please get in the car,&#34; Calvin said with a respectful bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car was a little dim, but she could still see the figure sitting down in the car and typing on a laptop but she couldn&#39;t see the person&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the car and sat down, leaving enough space in the middle of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin respectfully shut the car door when she was inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin started the car after settling into the driver&#39;s seat. The car started to advance gradually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry didn&#39;t speak so she wouldn&#39;t disturb him, she just looked out of the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Sherry&#34; She heard the man called beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her head to look at him, she realized that he already closed his laptop and was now looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as their eyes met, Sherry almost gaped. The man before her was  good looking- no good looking was actually a huge understatement. She was sure he was hundred times more handsome than any celebrity she had ever seen. His only dark hair looked like it was combed by his fingers and swept back away from his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a strong, defined and masculine jawline- it was perfection in her eyes. He just looked too good to be true. She was utterly impressed, and she had never been impressed by a man&#39;s beauty like this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could a mortal man look this stunning? But his eyes were ice cold and looked bottomless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She almost threw her determination away and fell for this man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to mutter, &#39;Holy Ghost fire&#39; three times under her breath three times before she regained her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it! This man is a temptation!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would blame her even if she forced herself and slept with the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could resist such a temptation?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man waved his finger in her eyes, and she quickly regained her lost composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly looked away from the man and stared at her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are drooling&#34; She heard the man say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>i-I am drooling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly wiped her hand on her mouth and looked at it but nothing was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then realized that the man deceived her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her head and looked at the man with anger in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man chuckled when he saw the anger in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the man, &#39;He looked so handsome when he laughed&#39; she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin was shocked when he heard his boss&#39; laughter, this was the first time he heard his boss&#39; laughter so he was a little shocked but he is experienced so he didn&#39;t lose his composure and focused on driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry slapped her cheek lightly so she could regain herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared out of the window ignoring the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive was silent after this happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite being silent, the drive went smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>it was already 11:00 a.m when the car finally stopped</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin walked out of the car and carried her bag out of the trunk, he gave it to a man who walked out of the house where Calvin parked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car stopped in front of a huge mansion, her jaw immediately dropped as soon as she saw it. She didn&#39;t know what to call it, but a house it was not! It was way bigger than that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry Hue noticed a combination of numerous floors of a high rise building and a residential area that resembled a garden as soon as she got out of the automobile. Bryan&#39;s residence is a posh condominium called Golden Edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A typical wealthy family will not be able to afford to live in this new residential area due to the high cost and tight security. Additionally, no one can purchase a home in this area due to the high cost. She had heard that a mansion here would cost at least $50 billion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She now comprehends how the man is able to give her $100,000 every week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who is the man she married, exactly? Who is he, exactly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is his identity?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked quietly, but her eyes were cold and indifferent, as if she were not surprised to be here. However, if you closely watched her, you would notice that she was surprised.</p>
