                <p>&#34;Is this my Granddaughter-in-law?&#34; Grandma stared at Bryan for confirmation. She was a little anxious but she doesn&#39;t want to admit the wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What if the lady beside him is his Secretary, won&#39;t that be awkward?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma smiled at Sherry dotingly, &#34;How are you my daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a little awkward and surprised, She was feeling a little nervous for the first, although this was not the first contract marriage she signed..the Grandmas she met are always hostile towards her because they felt that she is not worthy of their son so she thought Bryan Grandma will be the samethis was the first time and elderly woman treated her so well so she was feeling a little awkward &#34;I&#39;m fine Madam&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What Madam?&#34; Grandma walked towards her and held her hand, her eyes were full of satisfaction, she asked, &#34;are you guys not married yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We already did,&#34; Sherry replied politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good girl..quickly call me Grandma like Bryan&#34; Grandma said immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at her with expectations in her eyes, like if Sherry didn&#39;t call her Grandma it would make her sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s cold heart melted a little, because his Grandma made her remember her late Grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at her Bryan for helpbut he was already sitting at the dining room acting oblivious to the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no choice but to follow her wishes &#34;Grandma..&#34; Sherry called out obediently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good!! Good!! Haha&#34; Grandma said with happiness in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come, come Good granddaughteryou must be hungry and tired from the long journey&#34;  Grandma held her hand and led her to the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry followed her obediently to the dining room, the woman she saw beside Grandma when they walked into together started serving the food..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry stood up to help her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No leave it, you are a guest here dear&#34; The woman smiled at her warmly, she was very satisfied with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Grandma saw this, she became more satisfied with Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave it for your Aunt Glady, she doesn&#39;t like people helping her&#34; Grandma smiled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded and sat down back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started eating silently while Aunty Gladys stood behind Grandma attending to all her needs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already in her sixties, she had already served Grandma for many years and she was always respected by everyone but that doesn&#39;t make her become proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They finished eating soon. Grandma didn&#39;t know whether to cry or laugh when she remembered that she didn&#39;t even know her granddaughter-in -law&#39;s name. She asked with a smile, &#34;Don&#39;t mind me dear, I was so excited that I forgot to ask for your name. What is your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry maintained a warm.smile on her face, &#34;My name is Sherry Hue&#34; She replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry had thought his grandma would ask about her family and background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she never asked for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She simply asked about her age, name and if she is still a student.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandma held her hand, and remarked, &#34;I have always trusted my Grandson&#39;s judgment. Both of you have to bear a great grandchildren as soon as possible, i want to see my great grandchildren before i died&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Grandma, don&#39;t say that,&#34; Sherry quickly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma you will live long&#34; Bryan also said at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you guys should bear great grandchildren quickly anyway&#34; Grandma said with a teasing smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was speechless when she heard, it was a pity that she is not destined to be the one to give the old madam a grandson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, we will try our best,&#34; Bryan smilingly said to his Grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at him in shock, the man was also looking at her with a gentle and loving eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart was pounding wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she knew that it was just an act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the doorbell rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Gladys walked towards the door and opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Flow?&#34; Sherry heard Aunty Gladys&#39; surprised tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunty Gladys opened the door widely for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The click-clack sound of high heels on the grounds was heard before a slender figure entered her view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman stepped in wearing a formal, waist hugging suit and a narrow skirt of the same color, showing off her slender leg. She had long straight black hair that hung on both sides, adding to a touch of her coolness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma&#34; The woman called in a spoiled tone and ran towards Grandma, she wrapped her arms around Grandma&#39;s shoulders, rubbing against her in a spoiled manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Flow, when did you come back from the United States?&#34; Grandma smiled at her warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow pouted a little, &#34;Grandma..i came back last night, i missed you a lot so i decided to come to visit you first&#34; Flow replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good girl&#34; Grandma smiled happily when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow stared at Bryan with obsession in her eyes &#34;Brother Bryan, I&#39;m back&#34; Flow said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ehn,&#34; Bryan replied coldly, not giving her a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow was not feeling awkward, she was already used to his behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked in surprise when she saw the woman sitting down next to him, she felt a little jealous when she saw her beautiful face..she felt threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother Bryan, is this your Secretary?&#34; Flow asked immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No..she is your sister in law&#34; Grandma answered for Bryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flow smile froze when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Si-ster in l-aw?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had an engagement with brother Bryan before she left the country to study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t resist asking, &#34;Grandma, I thought Brother Bryan and I were engaged?&#34; Flow asked bitterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What nonsense?! What engagement?! It was just a joke between the elders . You should not take it seriously!&#34; Grandma said sternly and looked at Sherry to see if she was angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was happy when she didn&#39;t see signs of anger in her face, she couldn&#39;t resist replying to the flow so Sherry won&#39;t get mad and divorce her grandson. If Sherry divorce her grandson, who will marry her Grandson?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although, she had it in mind for Flow and Bryan to get engaged before that is if Bryan accepts it but if Bryan rejected it she wouldn&#39;t have them engaged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow was a little scared when she heard the way Grandma talked to her, Grandma had never talked to her like that before. It was all that woman&#39;s faultshe looked at Sherry with hatred in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly forced out a smile when Sherry&#39;s eyes met hers.</p>
