                <p>His eyes grew heavy and was already half asleep when he suddenly heard her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this heaven?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan opened his eyes and held her hand feeling amused when he heard her question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Little fool&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked up when she heard that familiar voice beside her, she looked at him in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you in heaven too?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled and pressed his lips on hers, Sherry stared her eyes wide open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan locked her hands down and kissed her hard, His tongue sliding into her teeth with strong lust and desires, heavy and relentless, before releasing so he won&#39;t lose control of himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So are you in heaven ?&#34; Bryan asked, his eyebrows raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart raced, was she still alive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is not heaven?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pinched herself, &#34;Ouch&#34; She could feel the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan poured her a glass of lukewarm water, &#34;Do you want water?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded, she wanted to speak but she felt like not talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan handed her the water, Sherry drank it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt like she hadn&#39;t drank water for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt her throat was normal and she asked, &#34;I thought he shot me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was about to but got shot instead&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to stand up from his wheelchair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked, &#34;What are you doing? Do you want your wounds to get worse?&#34; She asked with panic in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smiled and was happy when he saw the concern in her eyes, &#34;This injury is nothing, all you have to do is to get well&#34; He said and helped her adjust the pillow so she would be comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry watched him and saw the beads of sweat on his forehead, her heart ached for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also wants to rely on a man sometimes, she also wants to experience love and wants people to love her but she is scared of being hurt. Falling in love with the wrong person hurts like hell but who knows who is the wrong person and who is the right person?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this is love?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recalled the day she was seriously ill, she was feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t go to work so she stayed at home. Her first love called her that fateful day, that he hasn&#39;t eaten anything since morning and he is sick as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked when she heard that he was ill, she felt like they were fated and compatible because they fell ill at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rain was falling that day, but she still walked inside the rain to her work and borrowed money from her friend. The money her friend gave her was less than what she needed, she needed $500 but her friend gave her $200 because that is all she had. Sherry didn&#39;t want to spend from the $200 so she trekked from her workplace to her boyfriend&#39;s house which was about ten kilometers or something under the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him the money and he was happy when he saw the money, Sherry felt it was worth it when she saw his happy expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She told him that she was sick and would go home first. Her fever worsened when she got home and she was feeling dizzy. She fainted twice but no one was there to take care of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even call her to ask about her health. When she caught him with her friend she suddenly felt that everything she did for him was ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard Bryan&#39;s voice in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry snapped out of her thought and looked at him, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What ?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan felt sullen when he saw that she was absentminded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is she thinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have been calling you, but you didn&#39;t answer&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry muttered an &#39;Oh&#39; and looked at him with a serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just got married today and I&#39;m already troubling you, don&#39;t you feel that I&#39;m a bad luck?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, even if you are bad luck, I&#39;ll be bad luck with you&#34; Bryan said seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweet talking to me!! Sherry thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sarcastic word she was about to say froze when she saw that his expression was serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she fell for him and he turned out to be like the guys she dated in the past, she was sure she would feel like dying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart couldn&#39;t take another heartbreak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is the kind of person who falls in love easily if a guy chats with her and she is free with him and she tells him some things that are personal, if the guy cares for her and shows his concern for her. If the guy treats her well and so many other things. She was sure she would fall in love with the person. That was why she avoided guys or talking to people, even females, because most of them are just hypocrites and only fake love is out there, no real love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pursue her lips, she blinked her eyes at him, &#34;Don&#39;t treat me so well&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I might become spoil&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is the result I want, I&#39;ll pamper you a lot  so you won&#39;t be able to leave me because no one else would be able to,&#34; Bryan said cheekily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry blinked and lay down on the bed,  &#34;I&#39;m feeling sleepy&#34; She closed her eyes after saying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he had to take it slowly before she would fall in love with him.  He suddenly felt impatient but he still decided to wait and take it slowly so she wouldn&#39;t run away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wheeled himself out of the ward when he saw that her breathing was even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know that the figure on the bed opened her eyes and watched him leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She always pretends like she was sleeping since she was a kid, so it is a piece of cake for her to pretend that she was sleeping when he was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed and thought about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should she really fall in love with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marriage she wanted was a loveless marriage she had thought about, if it is not possible she would just hire a surrogate then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he wants love but she doesn&#39;t want to fall in love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was feeling confused and didn&#39;t know what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To fall or not to fall?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made up her mind to let fate decide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed and closed her eyes to sleep for real this time.</p>
