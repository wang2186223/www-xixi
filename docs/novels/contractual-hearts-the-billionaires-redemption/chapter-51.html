                <p>Sherry frowned when she saw that she was not familiar with the voice, &#34;Who are you?&#34; She asked again her voice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is me Brittany, your classmate in Nevermore, have you forgotten about me so soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brittany!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already knew who it was when she told her name, they were classmate but they were never close to the point of calling each other beside she was the one who accused her of stealing her money in Nevermore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she overheard Brittany and Wendy talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Wendy who instructed Brittany to frame her for stealing her money. She told people when they were bullying her and calling &#39;Thief&#39; and all kinds of names but they didn&#39;t believe, she regretted not recording Wendy and Brittany&#39;s conversation then, it would have served as evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; Sherry asked, after a moment of silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing much, we are still classmates even though you took my money back then&#34; Brittany said in ridicule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wrong, Wendy asked you to frame me&#34; Sherry said, her voice becoming colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You How did you know?&#34; Brittany stammered, She then realized that she said something wrong,  &#34;No wrong i mean, what are you trying to say?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure Sherry doesn&#39;t have evidence so she could deny it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hehe, exactly what you thought&#34; Sherry said in a mockery voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brittany gritted her teeth, &#34;Anyway, i don&#39;t know what you are talking about, i just decided to call you to ask if you are coming for the school reunion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>School reunion?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is it really a school reunion? Or just a place to see how rich or how poor a person is, a place to know the people with power and the people that became wealthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>School reunion indeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brittany continued when she didn&#39;t hear a reply from Sherry, thinking that she was contemplating it. &#34;It is tomorrow evening, if you are coming it is happening in Golden Class hotel, Tendy organized it and she is also the one paying&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not interested,&#34; Sherry said and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blocked her number immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about it, The people who framed her of stealing their things, they would start talking to her six months or some months after. Sherry thought maybe they found their lost items, but why would they clarify that she was not the one who stole it but they will try to talk to her. She realized later that they never lost anything but were just following Wendy&#39;s order, what she was most confused about was why they always followed Wendy&#39;s order. She is not from a powerful background nor was her parents rich or wealthy but why would they always follow her order?. That is what is still confusing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped out of her thoughts and picked her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Tara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry picked it and put the phone on her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, you know the guy I told you that I&#39;m crushing on?&#34; Tara&#39;s voice was heard on the phone, it was filled with sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Sherry answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tara told her that, that she has been crushing on a certain guy since she was young, they could be considered as childhood sweethearts. She never confessed her feelings to the guy so Sherry advised her to do so, So her feelings won&#39;t become deeper so she won&#39;t end up being hurt if the guy doesn&#39;t have feelings for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I confessed to him as per your advice but i got rejected, he said he already has a girlfriend&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to Trendy hotel and bar. I also want to get laid by a handsome hunk,&#34; Tara replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am on my way there, wait for me okay? Don&#39;t do anything rash&#34; Sherry warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay&#34; Tara replied obediently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry changed her clothes, she had already put on her pajamas before so she had to put on another pair of clothes, she just wore casual clothes and walked out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw David in the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going out Young Madam?&#34; David asked immediately he saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan had strictly warned her not to go out alone, if she wants to go anywhere she must take a car with a driver to drive her.  Sherry didn&#39;t want to before but he insisted and she knew that he was doing it for her own good so she relented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trendy bar,&#34; Sherry told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay &#34; David opened the backseat door for her,  Sherry got in and he closed the door gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked to the driver seat and got in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started the car and drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got there in fifty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry got out of the car and walked into the bar, she looked around, using her eyes to search for Tara. She immediately saw her, sitting down at a corner drinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked innocent and vulnerable. Sherry approached her and sat down next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are here,&#34; Tara said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm&#34; Sherry hummed and poured alcohol into a glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took it and started drinking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sherry, am I not beautiful enough?&#34; Tara asked, her eyes were teary, making her look pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you are beautiful&#34; Sherry answered as she drank the alcohol in her glass in one gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It has been awhile since she last drank alcohol, and she felt the urge to drink more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, why did he reject me?&#34; Tara asked..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You told me he said he has a girlfriend, so if he dates you, he will be two timing and you will be the third party, do you wish to be the third party?&#34; Sherry asked seriously even though she was feeling tipsy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; Tara shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then that is it,&#34; Sherry said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway i don&#39;t care, i was keeping my virginity because of him before now i don&#39;t want to be pure anymore&#34; Tara said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you will not regret it?&#34; Sherry asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m an adult and I can decide for myself, how old did you lose yours?&#34; Tara asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;20 years,&#34; Sherry replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m 22, i don&#39;t want to be an old lady with virginity, Hmph&#34; Tara harrumphed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David saw that they were both getting drunk so he took his phone and called a certain person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, did anything happen?&#34; Bryan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No but Young Madam and her friend are drunk&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trendy bar&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay&#34; Bryan hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coincidentally, he was also at the same bar with Cornelius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up and walked out of one of the rooms inside the bar with Cornelius following him behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Cornelius asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were discussing something important before he received a call, and stood up to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wife is here,&#34; Bryan said..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornelius&#39; face turns green with envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Must you show off?&#34; He asked in a jealous tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan smile widened, &#34;Of course, it is a pity you don&#39;t have wife and you don&#39;t know how i feel&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34; Cornelius almost spat blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he not the one who gave him advice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will also go and look for a wife myself&#34;. Cornelius said and left before Bryan angered him to death.</p>
