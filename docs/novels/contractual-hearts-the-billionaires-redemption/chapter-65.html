The more he felt that he should make her pregnant, so she won&#39;t be able to run. He was about to tell her to forget about it, she should think that he never asked the question when she spoke first.</p>

                <p>Bryan sighed because it was actually that, &#34;It was love at first sight &#34; He said with a serious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was about to say something sarcastic when he added, &#34;It was ten years ago &#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry knitted her eyebrow, she never knew him ten years and she doesn&#39;t even remember meeting him, &#34;Ten years ago? We never met ten years ago&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We met, I also attended Nevermore high school&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was flabbergasted when she heard this, she gaped in shock, &#34;You attended Nevermore?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded understanding, &#34;Even if you attended Nevermore, that doesn&#39;t mean we will meet&#34; She said and continued, &#34;don&#39;t tell me you have noticed me and secretly fall in love with me?&#34; She arched an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan shook his head with an amused expression, &#34;No, do you remember the back of Nevermore, Someone gave a towel, I wasn&#39;t sure of what happened to you then anyway&#34; Bryan shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry thought about it and remembered, It was the day she was framed for stealing a phone, she was trampled on and the students poured different kinds of things like eggs, urine, sand, flour etc on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teachers didn&#39;t do anything about it because they believed that the students were right, since they said she stole a phone it means she stole it. They don&#39;t give a damn about poor students but they become bootlickers when they see the rich.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was feeling down, her uniform was dirty, she just wanted to run away from the place, she ran and ran and she entered a place like the school backyard. She didn&#39;t even know that the school has a backyard. She is the kind of person who stays on her own. She doesn&#39;t like moving around. She would rather stay at home for months than to travel. So she doesn&#39;t know a lot of places in the school except her class, the teachers office, the principals offices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw a young boy, he looked very handsome with an expressionless gaze. Sherry &#39;s face was swollen from crying and was in a daze. She thought Jackson was very handsome, but the boy in front of her was a hundred times more handsome than Jackson. Jackson looked inferior compared to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy&#39;s eyes were closed, he suddenly opened it alert. He was confused when he saw her, Sherry greeted him shyly but he didn&#39;t answer and just closed his eyes back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry pouted and sat down on the floor, she remembered why she was here, there was no place for her in the school. She closed her eyes feeling so sad that her heart hurts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt someone clean her face, she opened her eyes and saw that it was the boy. The boy was shocked when he saw that she opened her eyes. He thought she was asleep and just wanted to clean her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smiled at him brightly, making the boy dizzy. Even though she had flour on her face, she was still very beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you&#34; She thanked him sincerely from the bottom of heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the first person who showed kindness to her and treated her well even though he didn&#39;t do a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed the towel to her hand in a flustered manner, &#34;Take it and wipe your body. Your stink&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was not embarrassed when he said that she stinks because it was the truth even she felt that it was disgusting. People would try to avoid her because of the smell, but he didn&#39;t avoid her but he approached her instead. She was happy so she used the towel to wipe her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ring!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy phone rang</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy picked up and hung up after a few minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bid her goodbye and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never saw the boy anymore till she left Nevermore, she always misses him whenever she was bullied. She went to the backyard but she never saw him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sad and thought he also couldn&#39;t stand her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She speculated about a lot of things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like maybe he heard a few bad things about her that was why he avoided her. So she forgot about him after a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry looked at Bryan in shock, &#34;You. you are the boy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded when he heard this, he knew that she already remembered him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why did you leave and I never saw you again?&#34; Sherry asked, feeling angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, Grandma called me and asked me to go to Singapore. I don&#39;t have a choice but to go,&#34; Bryan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call he received that day was a phone call from his grandma. Maybe if he hadn&#39;t left, maybe they would have dated and gotten married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never believed in fate but he started to believe now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry nodded, &#34;Wow&#34; she said, she still couldn&#39;t believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you have fallen for me since then?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry snorted, he treated her with indifference when they met when he already liked hmph arrogant man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I have answered your question, shouldn&#39;t you answer mine now?&#34; Bryan arched an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry&#39;s heart jumped like it wanted to fly out from her chest, she clenched her fist to calm her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should she confess or not?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t know that even though he told her that he had been in love for ten years she was still scared.</p>
