                <p>She gasped when she saw the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a message from her bank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>588457XXXXX</p>
                
                
                
                <p>100 Million dollars has been deducted from your account to Bryan Tony 54588XXXX your remaining balance is 10 Billion Dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank you for using our bank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Bryan in horror, &#34;You..  How did you know my bank pin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bryan gave her a smug look, &#34;It is not that hard to guess, you forget things easily, so i guess your pin will be your birthday date, i tried it and it worked&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did he know that she would forget things easily?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even her mom didn&#39;t know that she forgot things, so she used her birthday date as all the pins in some things that she had to safeguard and no one knows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After surprise, what came next was heartache</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lost 100 million dollars just like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a little sad and depressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her defected look, Bryan heart softened, he was about to say if she needs money he can give her 10× of that &#34;If you.. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room door opened, Flow walked in before he could finish his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The both of them looked up towards the door at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry carried the tray and excused herself immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went to the kitchen and washed the plates before walking back towards Bryan&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw Flow walk out of the room with tears in her eyes. Her eyes sharpened immediately when she saw Sherry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow gritted her teeth and said, &#34;Follow me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry followed her because she had something to tell her to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked towards a corridor before Flow stopped when no one was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow turned around, she raised her hand to slap, Sherry held her hand immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow tried to remove her hands from hers but she couldn&#39;t, &#34;Leave my hand&#34; She said gritting her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry threw her hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow glared at her, &#34;Didn&#39;t you say you would divorce him in a month? Why did he return the money to me yesterday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry was shocked, he returned the money yesterday?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who did he send the money to just now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hid her surprise and put on an indifferent and cold look, &#34;I changed my mind beside her loves me so much that he doesn&#39;t want to let me leave&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow clenched her jaw in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brother Bryan doesn&#39;t want her to leave?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sent the money to her back an hour after she sent him a text message with the voice recording as evidence he also warned her not to interfere with his marriage or he would make life difficult for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is all this bitch&#39;s fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brother Bryan never treated her like that before he started treating her badly when this bitch came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry eyed her like she was an idiot, &#34;Besides, the 100 million dollars you gave me is like a drop of water in my husband&#39;s wealth, do you think I&#39;m a fool and doesn&#39;t know which one to choose in endless wealth and wealth which would last me for a year&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow clenched her fist tightly not caring about the pain, the 100 million dollars was all her savings she saved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow took a deep breath and calmed down a little, she just wanted more money anyway, a gold digger Flow looked at with disdain &#34;100 million dollars is not enough? How much do you want exactly?&#34; Flow asked. She would have to borrow some money from her dad or mom, that is all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherry smirked when she heard this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This Flow is really too stupid, why should she collect her money when Bryan had tried to give her all his black cards which were unlimited and a chicken change?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow thought she was contemplating it when she didn&#39;t talk for awhile, the disdain in her eyes increased, &#34;How about i give 500 million dollars, that should be enough right? Or that is too small, how about 600 million dollars?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not interested&#34; She said and She turned around and left after saying her piece of words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;900 million dollars&#34; Flow shouted behind her, but Sherry was long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow could not do anything to stop and watch her leave with a sinister look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flow clenched her jaw tightly, till it bled but she didn&#39;t feel the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was angry and wanted to vent her anger, the look on her face was sinister and vicious unlike the gentle look which was always seen on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Does she think she would laugh last?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dream on!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she refuses to leave, she should not blame for being vicious because she already tried to make her leave perfectly fine, now she would leave her life behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The money she would use to get rid of her wouldn&#39;t even be up to a million dollars, she knew that if the killers knew her status they wouldn&#39;t do it so she decided not to tell them who Sherry was married to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway it is just a phone call, no one would suspect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out her phone and dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Can you make someone disappear forever&#34;</p>
