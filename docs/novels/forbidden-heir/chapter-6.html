                <p>Jack&#39;s comments continued to echo, heavy and disconcerting. I could feel Ethan staring at me, his eyes flaming with a combination of shock and rage, but I averted my eyes. Rather, my attention was drawn to the shiny tabletop, my thoughts racing. Too many questions remained unsolved. Why had I been picked by Henry Monroe? What did Jack have hidden? why was Ethan so determined to accuse me of a crime I had not committed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My attention was abruptly drawn back by the sound of a chair scraping the floor. Ethan jerked to his feet. He scowled at me, his jaw tightening and his eyes flashing with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He whispered, more to himself than to anybody else, &#34;This is a joke.  It must be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pivoted sharply and strode in the direction of the window, his posture rigid and resentful. Uncertain of what to say, I studied him from my seat. A part of me wanted to scream that I didn&#39;t want to be involved in this and that I had never asked to be pulled into his world, and I wanted to stand up and defend myself. However, the other part of me remained motionless, the part still reeling from the shock of the will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan abruptly turned back around and met my gaze. With a menacing tone, he asked, &#34;You expect me to believe that you don&#39;t know anything about this? That you simply... came up here knowing nothing at all and not understanding why my father left you a fortune?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gently got up while attempting to maintain a steady voice. &#34;That is precisely what I am saying. Henry Monroe named me in his will, but I have no idea why. Until a few days ago, I had no idea who he was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shook his head and gave a hard laugh. &#34;You&#39;re the luckiest woman alive, or the best liar in the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the frustration rising in my chest and crossed my arms. &#34;What makes me lie about this? What could I possibly gain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence towered over me like a black cloud as his eyes sharpened and he moved closer. &#34;Money. Power. You want to take over my father&#39;s legacy, and I won&#39;t let you succeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked, surprised at the sharpness in his words. &#34;You believe I&#39;m only here to make money? Do you think I should participate in this? I promise I don&#39;t. Like you, I&#39;m completely perplexed and all I want is some clarification.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clarification?&#34; With a hard gaze, Ethan scoffed. &#34;You don&#39;t seem to be looking for clarification. I believe you&#39;re pursuing a far more significant goal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel the heat of his rage radiating off of him; he was too close now. Though his remarks hurt, I didn&#39;t give up. I met his look, not letting intimidation get the better of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not chasing anything,&#34; I firmly declared. &#34;I don&#39;t know why your father gave me anything, and the money isn&#39;t important to me. Like you, I just want to figure out what&#39;s going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s gaze tightened, as though he was attempting to look beyond me and discover the lie he was so certain I was concealing. Tension filled the air between us for a time, and I was afraid he would strike out again. However, the conference room door suddenly opened before he could continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall man entered, wearing a dark suit and wearing an inquisitive yet friendly expression. He was looking between Ethan and me, his sandy brown hair slightly unkempt and his green eyes slightly amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I disturbing something?&#34; he smirked and inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s look hardened as his shoulders stiffened and he turned to confront the visitor. &#34;Now is not the time, Ben.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben, obviously unmoved by Ethan&#39;s rage, arched an eyebrow. His eyes shifted to me and he said, &#34;Is this the mysterious Emily Clark you&#39;ve been talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben stepped deeper into the room, ignoring the warning glance that Ethan threw him. &#34;You&#39;re the one who&#39;s agitating Ethan, then?&#34; With a friendly and warm smile, he held out his hand to me. &#34;Ben Fisher, Ethan&#39;s  friend and associate. It&#39;s good to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a little period of hesitation caused by the abrupt change in the atmosphere of the room, I took his hand and grinned politely in return. &#34;Emily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, Emily,&#34; Ben remarked, giving Ethan a playful sidelong glance. &#34;I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;ve done to get under his skin, but congratulations,&#34; he added. &#34;That is no easy task.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan glanced at his friend and grumbled, crossing his arms. &#34;I told you this isn&#39;t the right time, Ben.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben raised his hands in a semblance of surrender. &#34;Calm down, dude. I&#39;m only attempting to lighten the atmosphere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the tension in the room did not lessen. I could sense Ethan&#39;s resentment boiling just beneath the surface; it had not subsided. Ben seems to sense it as well, as he sighed and retreated after a little while, his lighthearted expression turning solemn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, okay,&#34; he murmured, dividing his gaze between the two of us. &#34;This seems like a serious conversation to me. I&#39;ll let you take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Ethan spoke once more before he could go, this time in a stern and uncompromising tone. &#34;Emily, you can act as though nothing is wrong, but I won&#39;t stop until I discover what you&#39;re hiding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scowled, my anger rising once again. &#34;I have nothing to hide. And we&#39;ll see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With mistrust in his dark gaze, Ethan shook his head. &#34;You&#39;re not welcome here. And I can assure you that you will regret ever coming to our city once I reveal you to be the con that you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath caught in my throat as his words began to drag me down like a thick robe. But I kept my worry from him. Rather, I turned my back on him and faced his intense stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not leaving,&#34; I stated gently but firmly. &#34;I&#39;m going to stay here until I get the answers I need whether you like it or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flared in Ethan&#39;s eyes, and I had a fleeting fear that he would lash out once more. He whispered instead &#34;don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you,&#34;  and then he stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there absorbing all that had just happened as my heart beat raced in the silence that followed. Ethan refused to accept me no matter what I said because he was sure I was hiding something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a little period of stillness, Ben replied, &#34;You&#39;ll have to excuse Ethan. He&#39;s been under a lot of stress recently. It&#39;s difficult to process coping with the estate and losing his father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just nodded because I didn&#39;t know what to say. It was not my fault that Ethan was upset. If I were in his position, I would be as well. However, this did not make it any simpler to accept his claims.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a little smile, Ben said, &#34;Just give him time. He&#39;ll change his mind eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I wasn&#39;t sure about that, I didn&#39;t dispute. Instead, with the weight of Ethan&#39;s threat still heavy on my mind, I smiled politely and grabbed my belongings. Upon exiting the conference room and returning to the busy streets of New York, I realized that this was just the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had the sickening sensation that things were about to grow much worse because Ethan Monroe was determined to make my life miserable.</p>
