                <p>I stood outside the school, looking at the old brick building as students shuffled inside, backpacks slung over their shoulders. Everything appeared normal for a moment. I was used to the pattern of the beginning of a school day, the distant laughter from the playground, and the teachers summoning children into their classrooms. This was my escape, my haven from the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I briefly thought I could keep everything out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily!&#34; With her typical radiant smile, Sophie hurried toward me as she called from down the corridor. &#34;I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re here. How are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made an effort to smile. &#34;I think I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Sophie came to me, her face softened and her eyes grew worried. &#34;I saw yesterday&#39;s events. Are you sure you&#39;re ready to be here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I needed to be here,&#34; I answered, sounding more composed than I actually felt. &#34;I thought everything would be normal here. Like maybe this could be my escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood and nodded. &#34;Yes, I understand. But now, Emily, things have changed. You&#39;re...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; I said quietly. &#34;But Sophie, I&#39;m still me. All I want is one normal day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed as though Sophie wanted to say more but resisted. Rather, she hooked her arm to mine. &#34;Let&#39;s head to class. The children will be delighted to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, we walked around the familiar passage, passing notice boards designed with motivational quotes and bright students craftsmanship. Somewhere far off, I could hear children talking, and briefly, it was almost like the past. Almost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The children&#39;s voices instantly stopped when I opened my classroom door. I felt uncomfortable for the first time as a dozen pairs of interested eyes turned to me. The kids knew. They must have discussed it with their parents. They&#39;d seen the news. I was no longer only &#34;Miss Clark.&#34; I was someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, class,&#34; I said, trying to seem enthusiastic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of them just stared, but a couple muttered welcomes returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled deeply before beginning the lesson for the day, settling into the pattern I was so familiar with. For a few minutes, I nearly forgot about everything else as the children progressively warmed up, responding to questions and following along. Teaching had always been my escape. However, reality soon returned with a bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, it was subtle. A student held up their hand. &#34;Miss Clark, is it true you&#39;re famous now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a forced smile, I swallowed hard. &#34;No, I&#39;m not famous. I&#39;m still just your teacher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the whispers didn&#39;t stop. The students exchanged glances and giggled with one another, as though I were some unknown celebrity. I started to lose the normalcy I had been holding on to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the knock on the door of the classroom came. When the door opened and a member of the school&#39;s administration appeared, her face was drawn and pale, and my heart fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Clark,&#34; she said softly. &#34;Could I have a word with you outside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and followed her into the hallway while the kids exchanged inquisitive looks. The woman turned to face me with an apologetic smile as the door clicked shut behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I apologize deeply, Emily,&#34; she said, clutching her hands. &#34;But the school has been overwhelmed since the news broke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. Feeling overwhelmed? &#34;What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a sigh and gazed down the corridor as though someone may suddenly burst through the doors. &#34;The media... they&#39;ve been calling non-stop, trying to get interviews with you. Reporters are camped out just beyond the school grounds. Parents worry that their kids will be exposed to all of this. It&#39;s getting to be too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver went down my spine. &#34;What are you saying, then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily, we can&#39;t continue like this. Unfortunately, until things calm down, we will have to ask you to take a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Take a step back? This was my job, my life. The one thing I had left that felt normal, and now even that was slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I muttered, &#34;I understand,&#34; but the words were harsh. &#34;I apologize for the trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The administrator nodded sympathetically at me. &#34;You are not to blame. It&#39;s just... this situation is bigger than any of us anticipated. Maybe once things calm down...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But we both knew things weren&#39;t going to calm down anytime soon. My heart heaving, I forced a smile and turned back to the classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, the day continued to drag on. Even the children realized something was wrong, as their usual enthusiasm gave way to reserved looks and hesitant questions. By the time the final bell rang, I was exhausted; emotionally, physically, mentally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were there when I left the school building. the media. Cameras ready, reporters lined the roadway. The moment they saw me was just around the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I accelerated, ignoring the yells and questions directed at me. I could hear their cameras clicking and felt their eyes on me, but I persisted in my desperate attempt to flee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arriving at my vehicle, I leaned against the door and inhaled deeply. I couldn&#39;t do this anymore. I couldn&#39;t act as though everything would return to normal. I had to go. Now there was no getting out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Margo, Sophie, and I sat in the living room together for what seemed like a farewell. They sensed that I was leaving, even though I hadn&#39;t told them yet. Sophie fiddled with her phone, her face pinched with stress, while Margo sat quietly with her hands folded in her lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, I broke the silence by saying, &#34;I have to return to New York.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margo&#39;s head jerked upward. &#34;What? Why? Emily, you can&#39;t go there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie&#39;s eyes were wide as she looked between us. &#34;New York? But... I thought you were going to stay here, where it&#39;s safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice trembled a little as I said, &#34;I don&#39;t have a choice. I was asked to resign by the school. And the press, they&#39;re everywhere. I can&#39;t stay here anymore. It&#39;s not safe, not for me... not for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margo shook her head and got to her feet. &#34;Please, Emily. We can work something out. You don&#39;t have to go back there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do. Ethan is correct. I can&#39;t hide from this. Now that I&#39;m a part of it, facing it head-on is the only way to cope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie got to her feet, her eyes full of tears. &#34;But what about us? What about your life here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a forceful gulp, my chest constricted. &#34;I&#39;m not sure. I have no idea how this will turn out. But I have to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence for a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margo approached me and drew me into an embrace, her expression softening. Her voice broke as she murmured, &#34;Be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned the whisper, my voice just audible, &#34;I will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie came to join us and put her arms around me. Her voice was full with emotion as she pleaded, &#34;Emily, don&#39;t lose yourself in all of this. You&#39;re still the same person you were before all this madness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, but I wasn&#39;t entirely sure. I was already beginning to feel different. Someone tougher, more detached. I wasn&#39;t sure if the Willow Creek girl would ever return because she was vanishing.</p>
