                <p>Ben quickens his pace to keep up with me as we leave the building, saying, &#34;Ethan, you can&#39;t keep walking away from me like this.&#34; His frustration is scarcely disguised in his tight voice. &#34;You owe me an explanation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hardly look over, maintaining a neutral attitude. As we make our way to my car, I exclaim sharply, &#34;Not here,&#34; adjusting my jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben doesn&#39;t protest, but he mutters something under his breath. He leans back in the passenger seat, his arms crossed like a reprimanded child, while I turn on the engine. I drive quietly, ignoring the heavy groans he puts out every few minutes, until we arrive at one of our favorite locations-a classy, private restaurant that provides the seclusion we require.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I give the waiter, who already knows our orders, a nod as we take our seats in a booth in the corner. Ben groans in frustration and runs a hand through his hair as soon as he leaves. &#34;This whole thing is suffocating, Ethan. All the falsehoods, all the secrecy... I&#39;m not built for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel my patience ebbing as I take a sip of water. &#34;Ben, we&#39;re in the middle of something far bigger than personal discomfort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please don&#39;t give me that,&#34; he yells, bending forward. &#34;You just told the entire room that Richards won&#39;t be a problem, but you wouldn&#39;t explain how. And without consulting me or any of us, you have been making decisions that have an impact on everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you honestly think I need to explain every single move to you?&#34; I inquire, looking at him sternly but calmly. &#34;I&#39;m handling it, Ben.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Handling it?&#34; His face flushes with frustration, and he speaks angrily. &#34;So now you&#39;re playing chess master with people&#39;s lives? With my life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I allow him to vent by remaining silent, but as he continues, my annoyance grows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice falling, he goes on, &#34;Look, Ethan, you pulled me into this, and now I&#39;m knee-deep in lies and cover-ups, and I&#39;m just meant to trust you? To follow along mindlessly? I don&#39;t know how long I can continue like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our drinks come before I can reply. Ben picks up his glass and takes a long, thoughtful sip, as though the booze will calm him down. When the waiter has gone, I bend forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right, if you really need to know, I&#39;ll tell you,&#34; I offer calmly while closely observing his response. &#34;I gave Victor a call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s eyes enlarge instantly, and he almost chokes on his drink. He repeats, bringing his voice down to a ferocious whisper, &#34;Victor? Are you out of your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Slow down,&#34; I say. &#34;He owes me a favor, and I decided to collect. Victor has connections in law enforcement that most people can only dream of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben gives me a disbelieving look. &#34;So you&#39;re just... asking favors from Victor now? Since when did we become the kind of people who ask him for anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel the tension between us growing as I shrug. &#34;Because we were in a situation where Richards was going to destroy everything we had worked so hard to achieve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how do you know that this is truly over?&#34; His voice simmers with rage as he presses. &#34;How do you know Victor actually came through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because that&#39;s how Victor works,&#34; I say with a half-hearted sense of assurance. &#34;I asked him to pull some strings, and he did. Richards isn&#39;t a threat anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben wipes his face and shakes his head, taking in this information. &#34;Don&#39;t you see just how dangerous this is, Ethan? Working with Victor it&#39;s like putting your head in a noose and hoping he doesn&#39;t pull the lever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look him square in the eyes. &#34;Ben, I&#39;m not naïve. I understand what it means to work with Victor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why are you doing it?&#34; His voice hardly rises beyond a whisper as he hisses. &#34;Why not just go in a different direction?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My patience finally gives out, and I respond harshly, &#34;Because there is no other way. You think this is easy for me? You think I wanted to be in a position where I have to call in favors from men like Victor? I did this to keep us safe. To keep Emily safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben averts his gaze and clenches his jaw, displaying a strong conflict between loyalty and frustration. &#34;I understand your desire to keep everyone safe, but this... this doesn&#39;t feel right. It feels like we&#39;re just digging ourselves deeper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh as the situation&#39;s weight presses down on me. &#34;you have to make choices that don&#39;t feel right. That&#39;s the price of survival.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He twists the glass slowly in his palms without answering, gazing down at his drink. Words hang in the air, heavy and unsaid, and the stillness stretches between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben looks up at last, a mixture of resignation and rage in his eyes. &#34;Just... swear to me that you won&#39;t do business with him again without first informing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod slowly, even though I am aware that I might not be able to fulfill that commitment. &#34;All right, Ben. I&#39;ll keep you informed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He appears not totally persuaded, but he nods and sits back in his chair while taking another sip of his drink. &#34;So, what happens now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I say, with a calm tone, &#34;Now, we wait. Richards is temporarily off our back, but it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re done with the problem. We need to be cautious and cover any loose ends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben sighs softly and shakes his head. &#34;I didn&#39;t sign up for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I murmur in agreement. &#34;None of us signed up for that. But that&#39;s what we must do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our conversation drifts into silence again. We pay the bill and depart the restaurant after a few minutes, each of us absorbed in our own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weird feeling of dread descends upon me as we emerge onto the street. I&#39;m having trouble putting my finger on it, but something feels strange. I look about, taking in the surroundings, but I don&#39;t see anything unusual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we approach my car, I&#39;m ready to grab the handle when someone emerges from the darkness to obstruct my way. I recognize him-Agent Richards-and my heart skips a beat because he seems more fierce and angry than I&#39;ve ever seen him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice is brimming with hardly restrained rage as he continues, &#34;Ethan. Will you mind telling me what you did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my hands in my pockets and raise an eyebrow, pretending to be clueless. &#34;Done? Richards, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffs and advances a step. &#34;Cut the act. I&#39;m not sure who you conspired with, but I was just removed from your case by my superiors. And that doesn&#39;t happen without some serious pressure from upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile puzzledly at him. &#34;Well, maybe they finally realized you were wasting time on a wild goose chase.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards narrows his gaze and clenches his jaw. &#34;You think this is a game? Monroe, you may have influential friends, but don&#39;t think for a moment that I&#39;ll stop looking. I&#39;m going to find out who you know, who pulled these strings, and when I do&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He falters, but it&#39;s obvious that he&#39;s threatening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I maintain my smile while I look him in the eye. &#34;Richards, you could give it a go. But I&#39;d suggest using your resources elsewhere. You know more productive areas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gives me a long look while wearing a mask of anger and irritation, and then he eventually backs off. He growls, pivoted on his heel, and vanishes back into the darkness, saying, &#34;This isn&#39;t over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk tugs at the corners of my mouth as I watch him leave. It&#39;s obvious that he&#39;s shaken. And that&#39;s sufficient for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The consequences of what I just did weigh heavily on me as I get into my car. Richards may be temporarily off our case, but he won&#39;t be gone for good. And when he returns, he will be much more determined to defeat us.</p>
