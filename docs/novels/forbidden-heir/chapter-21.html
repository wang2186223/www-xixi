                <p>&#34;You&#39;re quiet today,&#34; I said, watching Ethan across the table. We were sitting at a peaceful corner table in a tiny café close to the Monroe Enterprises headquarters in the early afternoon. I had recommended this location in the hopes that it would provide us with some privacy from the demands of the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan had left his coffee alone. His jaw was clinched, and his eyes were far away, fixed on something behind me. It wasn&#39;t the first time he&#39;d been like this recently, distracted, on edge. I sensed that something wasn&#39;t right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan finally looked up at me. &#34;I&#39;m alright,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment I didn&#39;t believe him. &#34;You&#39;ve been acting strange for days now. What is happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darted to the side as he paused. &#34;There&#39;s really a lot going on with this company. We&#39;re dealing with some tough negotiations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Negotiations?&#34; I questioned, arching my brow. &#34;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s bothering you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben showed up and pulled up a chair next to us before he could respond. There was a touch of anxiety in his eyes, but his customary easy smile was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben sat down and clapped Ethan on the shoulder, saying, &#34;Sorry, I&#39;m late. Hope I didn&#39;t miss anything interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I answered, looking between them, &#34;Not much.&#34; I couldn&#39;t get rid of the feeling that something was being kept from me, even though Ben and Ethan were close and Ben&#39;s sudden appearance wasn&#39;t out of the ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay, man?&#34; Ben&#39;s eyes were piercing and his voice light as he asked Ethan. &#34;You&#39;ve been pretty out of it today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan made an effort to smile, but it fell short of his eyes. &#34;I&#39;m alright. Just a lot on my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms and reclined in my chair. &#34;You both know that you are horrible liars?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben laughed, but it was a hollow sound. &#34;Come on, Em. I think you&#39;re overthinking things. It&#39;s just a difficult week. Running Monroe Enterprises isn&#39;t exactly a walk in the park.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, not convinced, &#34;Maybe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a quick look at his phone, Ethan jumped up suddenly. &#34;I&#39;ve got to go. I&#39;ll meet you at the office later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben and I were seated at the table when Ethan left before I could speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched him vanish around the corner. &#34;He&#39;s hiding something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben took a drink of his coffee and shrugged. &#34;Ethan&#39;s plate has always been full. You have seen how this place works. He&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nagging sensation in the back of my mind persisted even after I remained silent. Something significant was being withheld from me by Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned to the apartment that evening, trying to get rid of the weird feeling that had descended upon me following my encounter with Ethan. I detested being in the dark, and lately, it seemed like I had been there all along, kept in the background while something far more important took place all around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice yelled out behind me just as I was ready to go inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Clark?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to see a man standing at the building&#39;s entrance. He was wearing a simple black suit that made me uneasy right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; Narrowing my gaze, I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man showed off his badge. &#34;FBI Agent Richards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat skipped in my chest. &#34;The FBI?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step closer and nodded. &#34;I would like to ask you some questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around and swallowed hard. &#34;What are the questions about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Monroe Enterprises,&#34; Richards stated in a relaxed yet forceful tone. &#34;You&#39;ve recently taken on a prominent role in the company, and we&#39;re keeping an eye on things. We just want to make sure everything is running smoothly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurriedly answered, &#34;Everything&#39;s fine. I haven&#39;t done anything wrong, so I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re looking for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it didn&#39;t reach his eyes, Richards smiled. &#34;I&#39;m not here to accuse you of anything, Miss Clark. But you should be aware that Monroe Enterprises is under investigation. We have been investigating your father&#39;s business for a while now, including money laundering and arms deals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth became dry. Arms deals? Money laundering? I had never heard of any of this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stumbled, &#34;I... I don&#39;t know anything about that. I just started working with the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After examining me for a while, Richards nodded. &#34;Perhaps you don&#39;t. But I&#39;d advise you to be careful. Things are complicated over there, and you might not know who you can trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned as my mind raced with confusion. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards repeated, &#34;Just be careful,&#34; in a quiet voice. &#34;With Ethan in particular.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went cold. &#34;Ethan? What role does he play in this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards looked back at me after glancing around the deserted street. &#34;I have little to say. But I can tell you this, Ethan Monroe is being watched closely. We have grounds to suspect that he is engaged in some... dubious activity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart fell. &#34;Ethan wouldn&#39;t...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards cut in a soft but stern voice, saying, &#34;Miss Clark, just be careful. Monroe Enterprises has secrets. And sometimes, those secrets can be dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started to object, but my words would not come out. Richards gave me a courteous nod and turned to go, vanishing like a shadow into the night before I could say anything more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long time, I stood there with my head whirling. What had just happened? Was Monroe Enterprises being investigated by the FBI? And they were watching Ethan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced the floor of the flat again, my mind a jumbled mess. The FBI was investigating the company, and Ethan was at the center of it. It was illogical. Why would Ethan engage in criminal activity? Yes, he was spoiled and arrogant, but a criminal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, I reached for my phone and dialed Sophie&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily!&#34; As happy as ever, Sophie&#39;s voice could be heard over the line. &#34;How are you finding New York?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not great,&#34; I said as I collapsed on the couch. &#34;I&#39;m not even sure where to begin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no,&#34; Sophie murmured, her voice instantly turning worried. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled deeply as I described the events of the previous moment, including the FBI agent, the Monroe Enterprises probe, and the Ethan warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was done, Sophie was quiet for a while. &#34;Whoa. That is... intense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran a hand through my hair and mumbled, &#34;Yes. I don&#39;t know what to think. Recently, Ethan has been acting strangely, but this? It&#39;s unbelievable that he would be involved in such a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you trust him?&#34; Sophie asked in a quiet but earnest tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure,&#34; I said. &#34;I sense that he hides something. But... I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s what the FBI is hinting at.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, Em, watch out,&#34; Sophie warned. &#34;I don&#39;t want you to get involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be careful&#34; but I wasn&#39;t sure how.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things were getting out of hand as I lay in bed that night and looked up at the ceiling. Something significant was being withheld from me by Ethan. And it was something serious, if the FBI was correct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to call Ethan to confront him and demand the truth, so I took a quick look at my phone. However, I paused. What if I got it wrong about the truth? What if all I believed to be true about Ethan and Monroe Enterprises turned out to be false?</p>
