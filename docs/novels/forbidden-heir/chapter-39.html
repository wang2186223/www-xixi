                <p>Before I could say more, the office door opened, and Ben stepped in, immediately sensing the tension between us. When he noticed my face, his normally easygoing manner changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; Ben inquired in a tone a bit too informal for the circumstance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasted no time. &#34;Ben, have a seat. This is something you must hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben didn&#39;t appear as shocked as I had anticipated as he approached and looked at Ethan before settling in. A certain knowingness was evident in his countenance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I expected Ethan to tell Ben the same story he had told me, so I turned back to him. &#34;Tell him,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan leaned forward and eventually met my eyes, his mouth clenched. &#34;My father engaged in illegal arms deals. Monroe Enterprises was a front for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought Ben would be shocked, dismayed, something. However, he simply gave a tiny nod, as though this was nothing new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation hit me like a kick to the stomach, and I froze. &#34;You knew, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben turned back to me after shifting in his seat and glancing at Ethan. &#34;Yes, I was aware.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger tightened in my chest. &#34;You were aware? And you remained silent? Ben, I&#39;m the fucking lawyer! I ought to have knew this months ago!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben remarked, &#34;Calm down, Jack,&#34; while making a pacifying motion with his hands. &#34;I myself didn&#39;t know until recently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Recently?&#34; I said it again, raising my voice. &#34;And you still hadn&#39;t considered telling me? You two geniuses thought you&#39;d keep this small information to yourselves while the FBI is investigating us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan interrupted sharply, &#34;Because we didn&#39;t want to cause more panic. Jack, I didn&#39;t want to involve you in anything. I believed that we could resolve this without exacerbating the situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Making things worse?&#34; I sneered. &#34;You&#39;re sitting on an illegal arms operation, Ethan! How much worse can things get, in your opinion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was at a loss for what to do,&#34; Ethan retorted. &#34;I didn&#39;t want to cause a commotion. I reasoned that we could deal with it internally if we kept quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take care of it?&#34; I raised my hands in shock. &#34;You ought to have approached me right away! I could have assisted in handling this-think of a legal plan, something to lessen the harm. But you and Ben chose to keep me in the dark instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben leaned forward in an attempt to diffuse the tension. &#34;We knew it was risky, Jack, so we didn&#39;t want to engage you. The fewer people who knew, the better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The fewer people who knew?&#34; Incredulous, I repeated. &#34;I&#39;m your attorney! Knowing these things is the sole reason I&#39;m here-to defend you from this kind of fallout. But you both thought I wasn&#39;t worth telling the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan leaned back in his chair with a heavy sigh. &#34;That wasn&#39;t the point. I simply didn&#39;t want to drag you into this situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced once more while muttering, &#34;And see where that got us. &#34;The FBI is already investigating, and they will eventually uncover something that will destroy us all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben sat for a while in silence, looking from Ethan to me. &#34;Look, Jack, we&#39;re trying to keep this from blowing up in everyone&#39;s faces. I understand, though; you ought to have been informed. We are responsible for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes narrowed as I turned to face Ethan. &#34;Has Victor Alvarez gotten in touch with you since your father passed away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s face became blank as he froze. He eventually replied, &#34;No,&#34; but there was a strange tone in his voice. The words sounded planned and practiced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned forward and crossed my arms. &#34;Are you sure about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s jaw tightened again, and I could see the lie forming in his eyes. &#34;Yes, I&#39;m sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Ben, looking for any indication that Ethan wasn&#39;t being honest. But Ben, with a bland expression, was an expert at deflecting. Ben said in a level voice, &#34;He hasn&#39;t gotten in touch, Jack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, I didn&#39;t believe it. The numbers didn&#39;t add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to take in the mess we were in, I stepped back and ran a hand through my hair. &#34;If Victor is involved, things will quickly get out of hand. Ethan, you can&#39;t continue to lie to me. If he has gotten in touch&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan got up from his desk and interrupted, &#34;He hasn&#39;t. I told you, we haven&#39;t heard from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked back to Ben, my gaze narrowing. &#34;And you think I&#39;ll believe it? How long have you both been involved in this, and now I&#39;m just meant to believe that you&#39;re both telling the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben shifted uneasily, but I continued before he could respond. &#34;This must be resolved before it explodes up in our faces. Telling the board is the only way to accomplish it. We might be able to save what&#39;s left if we come clean now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben and Ethan both leaped to their feet as soon as I finished speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their shouts echoed around the room as they all yelled, &#34;No!&#34; together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked by the intensity of their response and blinked in amazement. &#34;No, what in hell do you mean? The truth must be communicated to the board. Monroe Enterprises will be shut down when the FBI finds out if we don&#39;t notify them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With hard eyes, Ethan firmly stated, &#34;Jack, we&#39;re not telling the board. We lose control if we do it. They will panic, which will exacerbate the situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben steadied his voice and swiftly backed him up. &#34;He&#39;s correct, Jack. We cannot afford to have the board turn against us. It ends when they find out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My annoyance grew as I gazed at them both. &#34;You&#39;re making a big error. The board should be aware of the future. We must get ready for the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan reiterated in a final tone, &#34;We&#39;re not telling them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of the situation was pressing down on me like a crushing weight, and I could feel the walls closing in. Why they were both so determined to keep this a secret baffled me. Unless there was more to the narrative, it didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Ben, becoming more suspicious. &#34;Ben, what else are you concealing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben looked up at me, his face unreadable. &#34;Jack, I&#39;m not hiding anything. Our only goal is to prevent things from getting out of control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t believe him, though. Ben had always been skilled at avoiding awkward truths and diverting discussions. Now I could see it well.</p>
