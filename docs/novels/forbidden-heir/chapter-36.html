                <p>&#34;All right...Ethan, I&#39;m an adult who can take care of herself; I don&#39;t require your &#39;protection&#39;.&#34; Before she left my office, Emily shouted angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily simply won&#39;t give up; I had to take charge of the issue since it was getting out of hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I really wanted to tell her everything, I realized that would only make things worse. Before pulling her into it, I needed to fully comprehend the circumstance I had found myself in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps she ought to have disregarded Jack&#39;s letter and remained in Willow Creek. Without having to worry about being singled out, she would have been educating local kids in peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe I should not have made that press announcement when she ran back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybes were out of the question. I had to take action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I considered my mother, Katherine, as the next source of information, at the very least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be right back.&#34; As I walked to the car pack, I said to the receptionist as I put on my jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had urgent questions that needed to be answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I entered Katherine&#39;s estate, I remarked, &#34;I need to talk to you,&#34; in a stronger tone than I had intended. I hurried toward the living room before the housekeeping could even announce my arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a glass of wine in hand, Katherine Monroe sat elegantly on a luxurious armchair, looking like the socialite she had always been. She didn&#39;t look astonished when I walked in, but she did raise an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; she said, sipping her wine delicately. &#34;To what do I owe the pleasure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t waste time making small talk. &#34;It concerns Victor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Katherine&#39;s face remained unchanged, I could detect a fleeting flash of recognition in her eyes. Leaning back and crossing one knee over the other, she set the glass down on the coffee table and traced the rim with her fingertips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victor Alvarez,&#34; I explained, taking a seat across from her. &#34;What are your knowledge of him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though the topic was already boring, she let out a sigh. &#34;Why are we talking about Victor? I thought he was your father&#39;s business partner, not yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>@Victor is more than simply a business associate. &#34;I remarked, my voice tensing with annoyance, &#34;He&#39;s dangerous. He is engaged in unlawful activity. I must know what you are aware of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katherine&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly as she observed me for a long time. &#34;Why is Victor suddenly of interest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused. I didn&#39;t want to tell her everything-not about the FBI or Emily. But I needed something, anything at all, from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With cautious word choice, I finally stated, &#34;Since Emily began working at Monroe Enterprises, things have become more complicated.&#34; Victor has been pressuring me to carry on with some of the agreements my father made with him. I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m really interested in these deals. I must understand what I&#39;m up against.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile, but not one of laughter, curved Katherine&#39;s lips. &#34;Ethan, your father and Victor had a tight relationship, but I wasn&#39;t really aware of their interactions. For the most part, your father kept me in the dark about his affairs. And I preferred it that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Mom,&#34; I pressed. &#34;You were married to Henry Monroe for years. You must know something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, she swirled her glass of wine and put it down. &#34;Ethan, Henry was a man of secrets. He didn&#39;t tell me much, and I didn&#39;t ask. However, I do recall tidbits of what he and Victor talked about. They were... somewhat alike. Both are driven and prepared to go to any lengths to achieve their goals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whispered, &#34;Victor is more than ambitious. He is merciless. A man who would always find reason to motivate you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a glimmer of comprehension in Katherine&#39;s eyes. &#34;Yes, he is. Henry once said that about him, I recall. Victor knew no bounds. He was indifferent to the dangers. His primary concern was power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned forward and scowled. &#34;Do you have any other memories? Anything that could be of use to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped and gave it some thought. &#34;There were times when Henry seemed... uneasy around Victor. It was rare, but it did occur. I used to believe it was simply business stress, but now I&#39;m not sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uneasy?&#34; I repeated. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katherine gave a gentle shrug. &#34;Victor had a way of making people feel like they were in his debt, like they owed him something. Even though your father was proud, he couldn&#39;t get rid of the sense that Victor was superior to him. I don&#39;t know what it was, but it bothered him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill took hold of my chest. What chance did I have of getting away from Victor if even Henry, with his immense power, had felt trapped by him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything else?&#34; I asked, attempting to control my frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katherine cocked her head in contemplation. &#34;Only that Henry always said you should never fully trust Victor. Dealing with him was not something you should do lightly. Once you were in, you were in for life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a seat back and listened to her comments. Although it wasn&#39;t much, it did support my long-held suspicion that Victor had an advantage over my father. And now, I had inherited whatever that was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katherine&#39;s voice softened for the first time as she said, &#34;I wish I could help you more. However, as I previously stated, Henry concealed the majority of his interactions with Victor from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up and nodded. &#34;Thank you, Mom. It helps. More than you realize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed slightly as she kept a close check on me as I turned to go. &#34;Watch out, Ethan. You&#39;re playing a dangerous game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped and looked back at her. &#34;I understand. And I am not my father, I can handle myself and Victor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed in my pocket as I left the house. I felt the air leave my lungs as I took it out and looked at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily: I can&#39;t stand you any longer. I&#39;m leaving the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank as I gazed at the message. Now that she is tired of me, the person I am attempting to stay near to protect-without explaining why-is stepping back into Victor&#39;s chilly grasp.</p>
