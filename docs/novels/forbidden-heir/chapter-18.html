                <p>My PA&#39;s voice hummed over the radio, &#34;You have a guest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a look at the clock. I had no meetings for the day, and it was drawing near to lunchtime. &#34;Who is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He says he&#39;s with the FBI.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat skipped in my chest. FBI? That was the last thing I needed. I inhaled deeply, gathering my thoughts. &#34;Send him in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall man in a black, fitting suit entered as the door flung open. He had an untrustworthy look because he was too cool. He looked rapidly around the room before focusing on me. He didn&#39;t waste time making small talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his badge long enough for me to see it before putting it back into his jacket. &#34;Mr. Monroe, I&#39;m Agent Richards, FBI,&#34; he stated. &#34;I have a few questions about Monroe Enterprises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heartbeat accelerated. &#34;Questions? What is this about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards took a while to reply. Rather, he walked slowly around the room, assessing the value of everything in my office. He turned back to me at last, but his expression made it clear that he wasn&#39;t playing around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards stated bluntly, &#34;Monroe Enterprises has been flagged in connection with a number of ongoing investigations. We must make some clarifications. Your cooperation would be greatly appreciated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to speak smoothly while leaning back in my chair. &#34;Monroe Enterprises is a legitimate business. investments and real estate. Nothing against the law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards said, &#34;Of course,&#34; with what could only be called a smirk lifting the corner of his mouth a little. &#34;We&#39;re only here to make some clarifications. Don&#39;t you mind answering a few questions, surely?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sensed the pressure increasing. This was no ordinary check-in. I was aware of that. Standing in front of me was evidence that the government was paying too much attention, as my father had often warned me about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hid my discomfort as I answered, &#34;Of course, I&#39;m happy to cooperate.&#34; But I&#39;d like to know exactly what this is about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uninvited, Richards sat down and leaned forward a little. &#34;We are looking into potential links between illegal arms trafficking operations and Monroe Enterprises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made an effort to maintain a neutral demeanor, but the words struck me like a sledgehammer. Arms trafficking? My father&#39;s dubious activities had always been concealed under a number of respectable business facades. I was now paying for the ignorance I had shown by never asking questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was cautious when I said, &#34;I don&#39;t know what you mean. Monroe Enterprises has nothing to do with arms trafficking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After examining me for a while, Richards shrugged. &#34;Maybe you don&#39;t know. Perhaps it&#39;s all too soon for you. However, your father; well, let&#39;s just say that Henry Monroe wasn&#39;t as clean as you may have believed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands squeezed beneath the desk. He was getting to me, but I couldn&#39;t let him see it. &#34;I was not involved in my father&#39;s actions in any way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it didn&#39;t reach his eyes, Richards smiled. &#34;In my line of work, I hear that a lot. Companies blame former management, and sons blame their fathers. To me, everything is the same. To be clear, though, Mr. Monroe, we will continue to dig. And we will return if we discover any evidence linking Monroe Enterprises to unlawful activity. Perhaps you should be ready for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a smile and answered, &#34;I have nothing to hide. You&#39;re welcome to look into our records. Everything is transparent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards stood up and straightened his jacket, saying, &#34;I&#39;m glad to hear that. Just keep in mind that we will be closely watching. It would be ideal if you cooperated if you discovered anything unusual in your father&#39;s previous transactions. It might save you a great deal of trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pressure in the room was extreme to such an extent that I could feel it when Richards left the workplace. I didn&#39;t realize I was holding my breath until the door shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was bad. Very bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my hands shaking a little, I picked up my phone and called Ben&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up, Ethan?&#34; Ben&#39;s tone was informal, but I wasn&#39;t feeling friendly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you here. Now,&#34; I said in a strained voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben didn&#39;t ask questions. &#34;I&#39;m on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After fifteen minutes, Ben entered my office with his typical laid-back manner, but his eyes widened upon seeing my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat opposite me and asked, &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so frustrated that I ran a hand through my hair. &#34;The FBI is sniffing around Monroe Enterprises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben raised his eyebrows. &#34;What? Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my elbows resting on the desk, I leaned forward and said, &#34;Arms trafficking. They believe that Monroe Enterprises has ties with illegal arms deals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben gave me a long look before whistling softly. &#34;Ethan, shit. That&#39;s not good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No kidding,&#34; I said as I paced the space. &#34;Everything is being investigated. It&#39;s over if they learn about Victor. I&#39;m in serious trouble. The business is messed up. Everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victor? who the hell is Victor?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah about that, a man I see around my father then. He got to me yesterday and told me about arm deals and continuing from where my father stopped. And yes he wasn&#39;t asking.&#34; I did not know when I confessed everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben, mouth open in surprise, &#34;Man you are so fucked&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I responded, &#34;Maybe tell me something I don&#39;t know&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben rubbed the back of his neck while leaning back in his chair. &#34;Victor&#39;s dangerous, man. If the FBI finds out what your father was doing, they&#39;ll come after you next. And Victor? He will bury you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that!&#34; I said, raising my voice. &#34;But what am I supposed to do? Victor expects me to keep the operations going, and the FBI is already breathing down my neck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben remained silent for a while, his expression solemn. &#34;Ethan, you have to choose. Either you figure out a way to leave before it&#39;s too late, or you continue to play Victor&#39;s game and risk everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to him and stopped pacing. &#34;Leave? How? Victor doesn&#39;t let people walk away. And I can&#39;t go to the cops without ruining everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben gave a shrug. &#34;Fuck man! There&#39;s always a way though. You just have to figure out what it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to believe him, but it didn&#39;t feel that simple. Already, the walls were closing in. Victor on one side and the FBI on the other. I felt as though every move I made was wrong, and I was stuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was distracted from my thoughts as my phone buzzed on the desk. I took a quick look at the screen; a security system alert. I picked it up and scowled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Security alert: Possible surveillance device detected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell?&#34; I got up and looked around the room, muttering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Ben got to his feet and asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I looked around the office, I exclaimed, &#34;There&#39;s a bug in here. Someone&#39;s been spying on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s face was strained as he looked around. &#34;The FBI?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked over to the window and didn&#39;t answer immediately. I ran my hands along the sill&#39;s edge. A tiny, hardly perceptible gadget was hidden into the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled the device out and showed it to Ben, whispering, &#34;Damn. This is not good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben frowned as he took the gadget from me and looked it over. &#34;Who do you think planted it? The FBI?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I responded, &#34;Maybe. Or Victor might.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s face grew serious. &#34;If Victor&#39;s spying on you, then you&#39;re in deeper shit than I thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. I had no idea who was keeping an eye on me. Whether it was Victor or the FBI, and I had no idea how to get out.</p>
