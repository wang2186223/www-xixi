                <p>&#34;How did this end up on my desk?&#34; My voice boomed in the otherwise quiet office, sharper than I had meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben winced a little, but it was enough for me to see. His normal poise briefly wavered as he arranged the pile of papers on the table. He avoided looking at me as he added, &#34;It was routed through accounting. Standard procedure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This sloppy work doesn&#39;t usually mean standard procedure.&#34; I opened the folder and quickly looked through its contents. The numbers were off. Expenses that weren&#39;t accompanied by invoices and names that weren&#39;t those of our usual suppliers. This was planned, not merely reckless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, the air felt heavy in my office. The anxiety that had settled here like a storm cloud was not much lessened by the quiet hum of the city outside. I reclined in my seat and looked at Ben. His usual easy assurance was gone as he shuffled on his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The charge hung in the air as I added, &#34;You&#39;ve been distracted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a while, but not long. &#34;There&#39;s a lot going on,&#34; he answered in a bland tone. &#34;You are aware of how it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited to reply, allowing the stillness to weigh heavily on him. Ben was my right hand and best ally. He had to be the one person I could trust in this situation. Even he felt distant lately, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tossed the folder across the desk and eventually said, &#34;Get this cleaned up. And discover who has been faking the reports.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben nodded and quietly picked up the folder. I couldn&#39;t shake the sense that he was carrying more weight on his shoulders than was reasonable and that his steps were heavier than normal as he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, the tense quiet was broken by the sound of the phone ringing. I immediately recognized the number and felt a knot in my stomach. Victor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the third ring, I answered. &#34;Victor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, my boy,&#34; he said in a cool, steady voice. Like a velvet-wrapped sword, it always had a scary edge. &#34;How is our empire doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stable,&#34; I answered, keeping a steady tone. &#34;For the time being.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a low, frightening laugh. &#34;For the time being. I&#39;ll act as though I can&#39;t hear the uncertainty in your voice. Ethan, you&#39;ve been busy. Additionally, mistakes are caused by distractions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I claimed that everything was under control, but even I wasn&#39;t quite sure. &#34;If Richards is involved...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor interrupted sharply, &#34;Richards is a problem. An issue that you ought to have addressed by now. Ethan, the man is a cock. Before he crawls into places he shouldn&#39;t, step on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held onto the desk&#39;s edge, feeling grounded by the cool wood. &#34;He&#39;s being led and controlled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s voice became colder and lower. &#34;Let me clarify one thing. There won&#39;t be another warning if Richards finds anything that links you or me. I&#39;ve given you enough time to take charge. Keep me from regretting it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could reply, the line died. Carefully setting the phone down, I gazed at it as though it could revive. I kept hearing Victor&#39;s remarks, like a steady drumbeat of pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Emily, a welcome but complicated distraction, knocked on the doorframe. Her heels clicked lightly on the wooden floor as she entered. She looked younger and softer today because of the way her loose hair framed her face. Her eyes, however, mirrored the tightness in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Busy?&#34; she inquired in an uncertain tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Always,&#34; I replied, forcing a tiny smile. &#34;What are you thinking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, tinkering with her finger&#39;s ring, an unintentional habit she did whenever she felt nervous. At last, she commented, &#34;We haven&#39;t spoken much lately. Really talked, I mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back in my chair and sighed. &#34;Emily, a lot is happening. You are aware of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do,&#34; she said, taking a step forward. &#34;However, that doesn&#39;t mean you have to ignore me. Ethan, I want to help. We&#39;re all in this together, no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes scanned mine for any weakness in the armor I had built around myself, and her words were sincere. However, I had no idea who to trust anymore, so how could I let her in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;You can&#39;t help with this,&#34; in a forceful but gentle way. &#34;It&#39;s better if you concentrate on your mother, the board, and the business. I&#39;ll control the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crossed her arms and scowled. &#34;That is unfair. You have no right to judge what I am or am not capable of handling. Ethan, we&#39;re meant to be partners. However, it seems like you&#39;re handling things alone these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved to stand in front of her by going around the desk. I said in a quiet voice, &#34;I am carrying it alone. Because it&#39;s the only way to protect you. You and everybody else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face relaxed, but her eyes stayed filled with frustration. &#34;Ethan, you&#39;re going to crumble under this burden. What happens to the rest of us when you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had nothing to say to her. Rather, I put a hand on her shoulder and gave it a light squeeze. &#34;I&#39;ll be all right. Believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked unconvinced, but she nodded. She said, &#34;Just don&#39;t ignore me entirely. If you need me, I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words stayed in the air long after she had left, and I watched her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling that something was slipping through my fingers made every second of the day drag on. I studied every detail that came across my desk, combed through papers, and spoke with workers. However, there were small but purposeful irregularities everywhere. A dangerous game was being played, and I couldn&#39;t afford to lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The telephone buzzed once more as darkness drew near. It had been Gerard this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; he said in his usual mysterious tone. &#34;We must get together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34; Already preparing for whatever fury he was about to give, I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, not on the phone,&#34; he answered. &#34;It&#39;s urgent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the clock and tightened my jaw. &#34;All right. Where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me an address that I was unfamiliar with. Before he hung up, he said, &#34;Come alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The burden of the day weighed heavy on me as I gazed at the phone for a considerable amount of time. It wasn&#39;t going to be good, whatever Gerard wanted to tell me. And the picture only got darker as each puzzle piece came into place.</p>
