                <p>I tried to convey a sense of serenity that I didn&#39;t feel as the elevator doors opened and I entered Monroe Enterprises&#39; busy office. With calls to make and meetings to get ready for, the morning had begun in a fog, but Emily kept coming back to me. I wasn&#39;t telling her everything, and I was beginning to feel the weight of that restriction. However, I couldn&#39;t take the chance that she would become embroiled in Victor&#39;s or the FBI&#39;s inquiry. That problem didn&#39;t need to involve her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben stopped me as I got closer to my office, a look of frustration fixed on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t continue acting like everything&#39;s normal, Ethan,&#34; he stated in a low but anxious voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pretended not to understand and arched an eyebrow. &#34;Ben, what do you mean? We need to negotiate deals and attend meetings today. That sounds like a regular day to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crossed his arms and sighed in frustration. &#34;Ethan, don&#39;t play games. It&#39;s pulling you in too many different directions. How long do you think you can continue this until something breaks, given Victor&#39;s demands, the FBI&#39;s breathing down our necks, and whatever you&#39;re doing with Emily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brushed by him, clenching my jaw. &#34;Ben, nothing will break. Everything is under my control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s voice rose as he followed me. &#34;You believe you have everything under control, but you are deceiving everyone, including Emily. She is entitled to the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my patience waining, so I paused and faced him. &#34;What Emily can manage is the issue here, not what she deserves. She doesn&#39;t have to be involved in this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack came into the room before Ben could reply, his face unreadable. &#34;We need to talk, Ethan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made an effort to speak steadily. &#34;Jack, what&#39;s this about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack took a step forward me and stared at me. &#34;It has to do with my role. I&#39;ve taken up Emily&#39;s case as her legal counsel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest constricted, and I tried to sound calm. &#34;You&#39;re our family lawyer, Jack. You&#39;re supposed to be representing both of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change. &#34;I am now her representative. I don&#39;t think you understand the situation you&#39;re placing her in, Ethan. She&#39;s in the dark about too many things, and that makes her vulnerable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben jumped right in, his anger exploding. &#34;Jack is correct. Emily is trapped with us in this chaos, and she has no idea what&#39;s happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the tension building as I ran a hand through my hair. &#34;Look, I understand how tough this is, but I&#39;m not bringing her into it. I&#39;m keeping her at a distance to protect her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack shook his head in a disapproving tone. &#34;Ethan, keeping her at a distance won&#39;t keep her safe. Whether she realizes it or not, she will be directly in the line of fire if things with Victor go out of hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my teeth and muttered as my eyes hardened. &#34;Jack, I&#39;ve made my decision. I don&#39;t need you to get involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s face became expressionless. &#34;You are just making things more difficult for everyone if you reject my legal advise. Whether you like it or not, I&#39;m here to keep you both safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben tried to diffuse the situation by placing a hand on my shoulder. &#34;Jack has a point, Ethan. Perhaps it&#39;s time to begin being more transparent. It will only get worse if Emily learns on her own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone on my desk rang before I could answer, breaking the tension. When I noticed the number flashing on the screen, the same sense of fear descended upon me. I knew who it was without having to look twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack looked between us, his brow furrowing in perplexity, while Ben&#39;s eyes widened slightly as he recognized the caller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, will you respond to that?&#34; Jack inquired in a dubious tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused and looked at Ben, who nodded slightly and advised me to proceed with caution. I picked up the receiver and cleared my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied in a bland tone, &#34;Ethan Monroe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; Victor&#39;s voice was silky, yet it had a tinge of dread that made me shudder. &#34;I hope I&#39;m not disturbing anything crucial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all,&#34; I answered, maintaining a calm tone despite my racing heart. &#34;How may I help you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Victor answered, &#34;I wanted to discuss our arrangement,&#34; and I could almost hear the smirk in his voice. &#34;I assume you haven&#39;t forgotten about our little agreement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Jack and Ben&#39;s eyes on me, listening to everything I said, and my jaw tightened. &#34;Obviously not,&#34; I replied firmly. &#34;I have everything under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; Victor muttered, his tone beginning to take on a hint of darkness. &#34;I would like not to be let down. Ethan, make sure you fulfill your half of the agreement, and there won&#39;t be any issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put the phone down as the line died and felt the anxiety fall heavily on my shoulders. I looked at Ben, and he gave me a very telling look. But it was impossible to read Jack&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was that?&#34; Jack&#39;s brows narrowed as he glanced between Ben and me, his tone fierce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to brush it off with a shrug. &#34;Just a business call. Nothing significant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack, however, wasn&#39;t persuaded. He crossed his arms and his eyes hardened. &#34;Ethan, I hope you&#39;re telling the truth. I need to know whether you&#39;re involved in anything risky. I can&#39;t defend you as your attorney if you don&#39;t tell me anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben moved uneasily next to me, obviously attempting to hide something from me, but Jack&#39;s suspicions persisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; Jack demanded in a stern tone. &#34;What are you actually up to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused, sensing the walls enclosing me. &#34;I assured you, Jack-everything is under control. I don&#39;t need you to get involved in my affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s face grew serious, and he sighed quietly. &#34;Ethan, if that&#39;s how you want to play it, then fine. Secrets, however, have a way of coming back to haunt you, believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben and I were left alone in the dense silence as he turned and walked out of the office. Ben exhaled deeply and wiped his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben whispered, &#34;You&#39;re pushing your luck, Ethan,&#34; in a worried tone. &#34;How much longer do you think you can continue doing this? Victor will not wait indefinitely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With everything bearing down on me, I slumped against the desk. &#34;I&#39;m not sure, Ben. However, I&#39;ll manage it and. I have no other option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s expression was one of frustration as he shook his head. &#34;You&#39;re going to have to inform Emily eventually, Ethan. She should be aware of her challenges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my head away, reluctant to accept the veracity of what he was saying. &#34;When the time is appropriate, I will inform her.&#34;</p>
