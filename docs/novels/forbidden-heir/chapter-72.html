                <p>As I walked down the tree-lined street, my boots tapping quietly against the pavement, the cool fall air bit my cheeks. The world was softly illuminated by the late afternoon&#39;s golden light, but it didn&#39;t seem to ease the burden that was pressing against my chest. Concerns for Emily, her mother, and how her life seemed to be changing into something I hardly knew consumed my heavy thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I dodged a man with his dog, I slipped my hands deeper into my coat pockets. My eyes were drawn to the tiny café in front of me by the subtle scent of roasted coffee beans. I had only intended to walk aimlessly, not to stop, but the prospect of a hot beverage and a peaceful spot to collect my thoughts was too alluring to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The loud hiss of the espresso machine and the soothing murmur of conversation welcomed me as I pushed open the door. A tiny sense of relief washed over me as the aroma of coffee blended with the subtle sweetness of pastries. Time seems to slow down there, providing a moment&#39;s relief from the bustle outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around, trying to find a table that was empty. The café was crowded, with a group of students engrossed on their laptops and a couple conversing over shared desserts. I moved toward an empty corner table by the window after my gaze fell upon it, swerving between seats and patrons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed a familiar figure out of the corner of my eye as I slid into the chair and put my luggage down. Ben. His forehead was wrinkled in concentration as he sat at a table a few feet away, his face illuminated by the illumination of his laptop screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fantastic, I thought, holding back a sigh. He had to be here of all locations in New York.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up and met my gaze just as I was debating whether or not to act as though I hadn&#39;t seen him. His face lit up with a smile, and before I could even come up with a way out, he waved his hand casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next he was closing his laptop and walking towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So much for solitude. &#34;Is there any situation where caffeine isn&#39;t your solution?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben was now standing in front of my table, carrying a cup of a neon-pink beverage with whipped cream on top that could only be characterized as an insult to coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Judging by your drink, I&#39;m not the one who needs saving,&#34; I quipped, raising an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a laugh, he placed his laptop bag on the chair opposite me. &#34;It&#39;s for my niece. I don&#39;t actually drink this-unless I&#39;m being blackmailed by a ten-year-old.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned. &#34;A convenient justification.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s eyes glinted playfully as he tilted his head. &#34;Mind if I join you, or do you prefer solitude with a side of judgment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I responded, &#34;Solitude doesn&#39;t argue back,&#34; but I pushed the chair across from me with my foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but note how his fine suit contrasted with the absurd drink he was holding as he settled in. Sitting across from someone who was so closely connected to Ethan&#39;s world was odd, but Ben felt... different. Perhaps less guarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always this friendly to strangers?&#34; he asked, opening his laptop and pretending to type.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cupped my cup and leaned back. &#34;Only to those brave enough to drink neon sugar in public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was unaware of the anxiety I was carrying until I heard Ben chuckle, a warm, sincere sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shut down his laptop and said, &#34;So, what brings you to this café?&#34; His eyes were keen, as though he already knew the answer, but his tone was informal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;Needed a break.&#34; &#34;It was heavy in the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face softened as he nodded. &#34;Emily must find Margo&#39;s situation difficult.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unconsciously swirling my cappuccino, I paused. She is immersing herself in her work, which is the only way she knows how to deal with it. Ethan isn&#39;t helpful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben leaned a little forward. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was unsure of how much to say. &#34;He keeps her occupied, assigns her assignments that I&#39;m not sure; I feel bad. I can see it gnawing at her, even if she won&#39;t acknowledge it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s mouth clenched. &#34;That seems about correct. Whether they want to or not, Ethan has a way of drawing people into his circle and holding them there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unspoken meaning weighed heavily on his words as they hovered in the air. I observed him, curious about his true level of knowledge about Ethan and his willingness to divulge it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that how you politely point out that he&#39;s controlling?&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben gave a shrug. &#34;He is complex. Even after knowing him for a while, I&#39;m still unable to determine whether he is utilizing or protecting others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a twinge of discomfort. That&#39;s not how Emily sees things. She believes he is acting in the family&#39;s best interests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you?&#34; Ben fixed his eyes on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused. In all of this, I believe she is losing herself. She has changed from the Emily I knew growing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s countenance was unreadable as he leaned back. &#34;That&#39;s not unique to you. I&#39;ve also observed Ethan&#39;s secrecy and his approach to situations. He seems to be playing a game that no one else is aware of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone tightened my chest in some way. &#34;Do you believe he poses a threat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben paused, seemingly considering what he was going to say. &#34;Not on purpose. However, even when he doesn&#39;t mean to, he does harm to those around him. I watch him-and now Emily, too-for that reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by the abrupt change in his attitude, I blinked. A sharper, more serious Ben had taken the place of the jovial, laid-back Ben.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whispered, &#34;You&#39;re concerned about her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a nod. She is good. Ethan is pulling her into a tangle that is too good for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were silent for a time. The hum of the café filled the quiet, broken only by the low murmur of people and the clatter of mugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally releasing the strain, I remarked, &#34;You&#39;re not as bad as I thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s eyebrow went up. &#34;Should I feel flattered or offended?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, a tiny smile tugging at my lips, &#34;Take your pick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With hesitation, I continued, &#34;Ben, do you ever think that we&#39;re simply... bystanders in all of this? observing them make choices that we are powerless to stop?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me for a long time before responding. &#34;Perhaps. However, that does not exclude us from taking action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed on the table before I could reply. I felt sick to my stomach as I looked at the screen.</p>
