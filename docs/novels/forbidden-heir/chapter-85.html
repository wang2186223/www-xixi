                <p>As the polished steel doors swung open, the elevator dinged, its sterile light bathing me in a dull glow. A weary, puffy-eyed, and unkempt image of myself gazed back at me. Ignoring the slick grandeur of the building, I entered the top-level entryway of Wentworth and Millers. Everything seemed hollow right now, and the heaviness in my chest wouldn&#39;t go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light glinted off the golden letters on the polished glass of Jack&#39;s office door, which was slightly open. I paused. Recently, Jack had been on the sidelines of everything-constantly there but weirdly removed. I needed to be told that I wasn&#39;t invisible. I breathed deeply before pushing the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a fountain pen sitting on top of a pile of papers, Jack glanced up from his desk. His crisp suit was spotless, but his tanned forearms were obvious since his sleeves were rolled up. His unkempt look had been remarkably refined. There was a hint of woody, warm scent in the air, and his brown hair was brushed perfectly. He looked better-different, as though he were releasing an unseen weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone eased with a hint of surprise as he said, &#34;Emily. You weren&#39;t what I expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsure of what to say, I stood there and shut the door behind me. My throat constricted, and tears rolled down my face before I could stop them. Jack sprang up, his pen clattering on the desk as his face changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried around the desk and said, &#34;Hey, hey. What&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head in an effort to speak, but all I managed to do was stifle a sob. Jack grounded me with his soft hands on my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, I said, &#34;Jack, I&#39;m so exhausted. Everyone is so busy. Ben, Ethan, Sophie I feel as though I&#39;m going away and no longer matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes searched mine as his face softened. He said, &#34;Come here,&#34; and drew me into a hug. The steady pounding of his heart on my cheek and the smell of his cologne were strangely comforting. It wasn&#39;t until then that I understood how desperate I was for basic human contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily, you are important,&#34; he stated strongly. &#34;Never assume otherwise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held on to him while I sobbed. Jack didn&#39;t draw away or hurry me. Rather, he led me to his office&#39;s tiny leather couch and sat next to me. He calmly waited while I gathered my thoughts and gave me a tissue from the box on the coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally answered, &#34;I just I don&#39;t understand. What&#39;s wrong with everything? Why does everyone seem so distant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack thought about what I had said, leaning back with his fingers curled beneath his chin. &#34;Emily, everyone is battling their own issues. They haven&#39;t forgotten you, though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I muttered, &#34;There are times when it seems like they have. Ben is always with Sophie. Ethan is involved in matters he refuses to talk with me. And me? I&#39;m simply here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s eyes got softer. &#34;You&#39;ve experienced a lot. Too much for most individuals to handle. It&#39;s okay to feel lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used the towel to wipe my eyes. &#34;Jack, you seem different. Better. What&#39;s your secret?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight grin pulled at his mouth. &#34;I&#39;ve been looking after myself and attempting to maintain balance. It&#39;s not easy, but I had to change a few things. For me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded with a glimmer of jealousy. Jack radiated confidence and groundedness. That kind of calm was what I wished I could find.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sprang up and said, &#34;Come on. Tonight, you shouldn&#39;t be by yourself. Let&#39;s leave this place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34; I blinked up at him, surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My place,&#34; he said, not missing a beat. &#34;Emily, you need a vacation. Just a little breathing room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused. Jack&#39;s personal offer wasn&#39;t typical, but I could tell by the tone of his voice that he truly wanted to help. And to be honest, I couldn&#39;t bear the thought of returning to my empty room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right,&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My expectations were not met by Jack&#39;s place. It was cozy, welcoming, and unexpectedly lived-in, a far cry from his businesslike way. The walls were lined with bookshelves that held a wide range of mystery novels, classic literature, and law books. Sleek yet cozy, the kitchen featured a small entertainment center and a soft gray couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack put his keys on the counter and added, &#34;Make yourself at home.&#34; He pushed his arms up even further and took off his jacket, laying it over a chair. &#34;Are you hungry? Thirsty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sank into the sofa and whispered, &#34;Just water, please.&#34; I was hugged by the cushions, and for the first time in weeks, I felt somewhat at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack came back with a warm mug of tea and a glass of water. He put the tea on the coffee table and handed me the water. Then he sat next to me, seeming interested and open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said softly, &#34;You want to talk about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the glass in my hands, watching the surface as the light caught on it. &#34;I&#39;m not sure where to begin. It seems like everything is going apart. Furthermore, I have no idea what I&#39;m supposed to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suggested, &#34;Start wherever you need to. I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I did. I shared with him my disappointments, my worries, and the nagging loneliness that had taken hold of my chest. Jack&#39;s eyes never left mine as he listened without interruption. He let me talk most of the time, but he did offer gentle reassurances when I tripped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I admitted, &#34;I just feel invisible. As if I&#39;m yelling into space and nobody is listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see you as invisible,&#34; Jack declared. &#34;Not to Ben, Sophie, or Ethan. Emily, you are important to them. Even if they don&#39;t always show it in the manner that you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I searched his face for any sign of dishonesty, but I couldn&#39;t find it. His eyes were serious, his words solid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is something you&#39;ve always been good at,&#34; I stated, trying to smile a little. &#34;Giving people a sense of visibility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack laughed. &#34;I suppose it comes with the job. But it&#39;s different with you. Emily, you are more than just a client. You&#39;re family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked by how hard the word hit me. Family. I had been longing for that, and it was comforting to hear Jack say it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I muttered. &#34;For everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth in Jack&#39;s eyes as he smiled helped to ease some of the strain in my chest. &#34;Anytime, Emily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We discussed lighter topics as the evening went on, including movies, literature, and even his botched cooking efforts. For what seemed like an age, I smiled, and it felt as if a burden had been lifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack led me to the guest room as the evening wore on. The bed was made up nicely, and the cozy gray sheets were inviting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay as long as you need,&#34; he said. &#34;If you need anything, I&#39;ll be in the other room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night, Jack,&#34; I mumbled quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight, Emily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I experienced an odd spectrum of feelings as I laid in the unfamiliar bed and stared at the ceiling. Jack&#39;s generosity had reduced the loneliness, but it hadn&#39;t fully disappeared. For the first time in weeks, I had the feeling that I might not be as alone as I had previously thought.</p>
