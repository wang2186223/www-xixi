                <p>&#34;Is that the third time you&#39;ve made espresso today?&#34; I remained in the kitchen, gazing vacantly at the coffee machine, until I heard Ethan&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at him. I saw him remaining by the counter with his arms crossed and a tricky smile all over. I murmured, &#34;Perhaps,&#34; as a slight flush crawled across my cheeks. &#34;I&#39;ve been occupied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step closer and remarked, &#34;I noticed. You&#39;ve spent the last hour brewing the same pot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to laugh it off by rolling my eyes, but the reality was that living with Ethan had completely flipped my schedule. He was there each time I turned around. At the point when I needed to unwind, I would go to the lounge room, the kitchen, or even the foyer. He was always with me, and I was starting to see the impact it was having on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waved him away as I poured the coffee and hurriedly responded, &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply leaned against the counter and observed me in his usual composed manner without saying anything. I could feel the tension between us increasing daily, so his quiet presence was unsettling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were now more than simply stepsiblings. It wasn&#39;t even the strange situation we found ourselves in, living together. Something more profound, something unsaid. And it became increasingly difficult to ignore the more time we spent together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swiftly shifted the topic after clearing my throat. &#34;Have you discussed the contracts for tomorrow&#39;s meeting with Jack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan groaned, and his face changed slightly. &#34;Yes, I did. He&#39;s... worried. believes we&#39;re taking on more than we can manage, but I&#39;ll find a solution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more, there was his protective nature. At Monroe Enterprises, Ethan was always the first to step in and take charge when something went wrong. He constantly stepped in to keep everyone else safe; that was just who he was. Including me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a sip of coffee and remarked, &#34;You don&#39;t have to keep handling everything by yourself. We should work as a team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes softened for a time as he gazed at me. &#34;I understand. But I&#39;m used to it. Besides, you&#39;ve had enough on your plate lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t dispute that. It wasn&#39;t easy to be thrown into this world of money, business, and danger, but Ethan had been there for me the whole time, quietly supporting me. I didn&#39;t want him to handle things by himself, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a little smile and added, &#34;Well, maybe I want to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something reserved in his smile, but he returned it. &#34;Thank you for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were silent for a beat, and for a second, I wasn&#39;t sure what to say. Walking a fine line between work and individual life, between being stepsiblings and... anything this was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, I ended up in the living room, nestled into the couch with a book in my lap. Tonight, the penthouse&#39;s silence felt oppressive. Even though we weren&#39;t in the same room, I could still hear Ethan moving around in his room, and it only served to highlight how close we were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I knew it, Ethan was carrying his phone into the living room. He looked at the couch, then at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he was already heading for the vacant space next to me, he asked, &#34;Mind if I sit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right,&#34; I murmured, stepping aside a little to give space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a few minutes, the only sound we could hear while we sat was the slight hum of the city outside. I pretended to read, but I wasn&#39;t actually paying attention to anything on the page as Ethan browsed through his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence was finally broken by Ethan. &#34;You haven&#39;t said much today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;Just... thinking,&#34; not really understanding how to describe the odd spectrum of feelings churning inside of me. &#34;There&#39;s a lot to take in about this whole situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without raising his eyes from his phone, Ethan nodded. &#34;Yes, it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him and saw how his face was shadowed by the light from his phone. It was difficult to breathe because of the way he sat so comfortably and near me. Even though he was just a few inches away, it seemed as though there was an invisible barrier between us that we were not allowed to breach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you thought about what happens after?&#34; My voice was quieter now as I asked. &#34;After Monroe Enterprises&#39; issues are resolved? after the chaos has subsided?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Ethan raised his head from his phone and met my gaze. He was honest when he said, &#34;I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t had time to consider what might happen next because I&#39;ve been so focused on keeping things together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I understood all too well and nodded. Nevertheless, the uneasiness continued to seep into my chest. Everything got more complicated the longer we lived together. Not with the business alone, but with ourselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;I guess we&#39;ll figure it out,&#34; but it sounded vacuous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, we were in silence, but it wasn&#39;t the cozy sort. It felt like a living creature, the tension between us getting heavier by the moment. I leaned my head against Ethan&#39;s shoulder without giving it any thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for helping me settle in despite being a pain in my ass initially&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He merely laughed and remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body was warm to the touch, and I could feel his breathing rising and falling steadily. I thought he would separate himself by pulling away, but he didn&#39;t. His body tensed slightly but remained motionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also didn&#39;t back off. I didn&#39;t want to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat like that for a moment, the distance between us vanishing. And I sensed something deeper, something unsaid, in that hush. It was getting more difficult to ignore the weight of our connection, and there was no denying the chemistry between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of us said a word, but I could feel the shift. There was no turning back since the lines we had been so careful to keep were becoming hazy.</p>
