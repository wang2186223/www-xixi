                <p>The office was quieter than normal, with the only sounds disturbing the silence being the odd shuffling of paper and the faint buzz of computers. I reclined in my chair and looked at the spreadsheet before me, the numbers blending into a hazy blur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest ached from the weight of my deception, a knot of shame that had taken hold and would not go away. In order to gain time and protect myself, I had told myself that giving Richards bits of irrelevant information would keep him at bay. It felt like a noose closing around my neck now, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt fear instead of relief because the sting operation had failed. But what if Richards returned and wanted more? What if Ethan discovered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked out of my reverie by a voice I recognized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ben, you seem out of it today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a start, I turned to discover Ethan standing at the doorway, looking at me. Even though he had a file in his hand, I could tell by his tone and posture that this was no everyday visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made an effort to grin. &#34;Long night. Too much coffee and insufficient sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shut the door behind him and entered. &#34;Working long nights is a condition. However,&#34; he pointed to the mess on my desk, &#34;this isn&#39;t like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands became instantly wet as I swallowed forcefully. &#34;Really, I&#39;m all right. I simply have a lot on my plate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s eyes narrowed, and it was clear that something wasn&#39;t right. Placing the file on my desk, he crossed his arms and leaned against the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stated clearly, &#34;You&#39;ve been distracted for weeks. Additionally, I&#39;m now noticing holes in our operations. Numbers that don&#39;t match, deals that don&#39;t add up. What is happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat became dry. &#34;Gaps? Which holes exist? Everything has been handled by me in the same way as usual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan cocked his head, examining me as if I were a conundrum he had to answer. &#34;Ben, don&#39;t tell me lies. I know you better than that. Everything is being affected by something that&#39;s gnawing at you. If something is wrong, you need to let me know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my secret weighing heavily on me, I paused. One of the few things I had always prized was Ethan&#39;s trust, which I was about to breach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, I-&#34; I paused and breathed deeply. &#34;I&#39;ve communicated with Richards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body tensed, and his face darkened instantly. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly, I raised my hands defensively and shouted, &#34;Look, it&#39;s not what you think. Months ago, he came to me in an attempt to get information. I only gave him enough to keep him off my back, nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s voice was dangerously low as his jaw clenched. &#34;You&#39;ve been feeding the FBI, are you telling me? Behind my back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a loud scrape of my chair against the floor, I got up. &#34;I had no other choice! Ethan, he trapped me. He was aware of things I couldn&#39;t explain. He would have followed us all more vigorously if I had refused.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stepped forward, anger flaring in his eyes. &#34;So, you chose to deal with it on your own rather than approach me? How risky was it, do you know? How much harm could you have done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked him in the eye, my own anger rising to the surface. &#34;I wanted to keep you safe! Keep us safe! I reasoned that he would retire if I gave him just enough. And it was effective for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unless it didn&#39;t,&#34; Ethan yelled. &#34;With someone like Richards, you don&#39;t deal. When you&#39;re no longer helpful, he&#39;ll discard you after bleeding you dry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now I understand that!&#34; I shot back, raising my voice. &#34;However, I didn&#39;t see any other choice at the moment. And I knew you would answer this way, so I kept it a secret!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shook his head, sadness and rage mixed together on his face. &#34;Ben, you should have trusted me. We&#39;ve suffered too much for this kind of treachery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I averted my look as my stomach twisted with shame. &#34;I thought you wouldn&#39;t get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You get it?&#34; Ethan gave a sour laugh. &#34;Do you really believe that I have no idea what it&#39;s like to feel surrounded? To make choices that aren&#39;t possible? However, concealing secrets from one another is not how we bear this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was quiet for a while, stress in the air. Ethan finally let out a big breath and combed through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I need to know anything else?&#34; His voice was lower but no less serious as he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my head away. &#34;No. That&#39;s it, I promise. I&#39;m done with him, too. I told Richards that this would be the final time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stared into my eyes, looking for any hint of dishonesty. &#34;Ben, it had better be. Because if I find out you&#39;re still speaking with him...&#34; The implied threat lingered in the air even though he did not finish the phrase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I acted as though I was paying attention to the job at hand, but my thoughts were elsewhere. Ethan&#39;s words kept repeating in my memory, serving as a continual reminder of how grave my error had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The workplace was almost deserted when I finally shut down my laptop and made my way to the door. As I walked to the elevator, the only sound in the quiet halls was the slight hum of fluorescent lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The burden of the day weighed heavy on me as I fell onto the couch at home. I was so concerned with the mess I&#39;d made that I hardly noticed the television&#39;s faint illumination playing across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was jolted out of my trance by a jarring knock on the door. As I stood there, the sound reverberated menacingly around the quiet flat, and my heart sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards was standing there with an enigmatic look when I opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could react, he remarked, &#34;We need to talk,&#34; and went inside.</p>
