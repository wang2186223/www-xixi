                <p>I gazed at my desk&#39;s cold coffee, the cream idly moving in the cup. Around me, the workplace was a flurry of activity, with phones ringing, papers shuffled, and footfalls resonating in the hallways. But it all seemed subdued, as though I were looking at a world that no longer belonged to me through a glass window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been days since Ethan had addressed me. Isabella, who had insinuated herself into every aspect of his life, had taken over his attention. They were always together, hunched in his office, leaving the building together at night, having hushed talks that made my back ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked out of my reverie when my phone vibrated on the desk. Jack had sent the message: &#34;Lunch later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about ignoring it, but instead, I grumbled and quickly typed back, &#34;Maybe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the last few weeks, Jack had been my salvation. His calm demeanor and witty comments had provided a much-needed break from the emotional turmoil that Ethan had caused me. However, Jack&#39;s presence was insufficient to stop the resentment that was starting to seep into my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to hear a sudden chuckle coming from down the hallway. Isabella&#39;s assured gait and easy charm irritated me as I turned to see her making her way to Ethan&#39;s office. When Ethan&#39;s door opened, I saw him happy, something I hadn&#39;t seen in weeks. I used to be the one laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made myself turn my head away by tightening my jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the hours passed, I lost all attention. I made an effort to focus on my job, but every time I looked at Ethan&#39;s closed office door, it was like a kick to the belly. The knowledge that I was being marginalized and excluded from a life I had fought so hard to be a part of was more than just jealousy gnawing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped feigning work by midday. I reached for my bag and phone, needing something, needing air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed loud voices as I walked down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tone that might shatter glass, Ethan yelled, &#34;You don&#39;t get to lecture me about loyalty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned toward the point of conflict and reduced my pace. Ben and Ethan stood close to the meeting room, their expressions tense with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allegiance?&#34; Ben replied, his tone just as poisonous. &#34;Don&#39;t discuss loyalty with me when you&#39;ve been deceiving everyone around you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With barely controlled rage bursting from his body language, Ethan took a step closer. &#34;Be careful, Ben. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re discussing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben laughed bitterly. &#34;Don&#39;t I? You think that the burden of this catastrophe is just on you? The bad news is that your secrets aren&#39;t as well-kept as you think, Ethan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Employees passing by gave them strange looks because of the obvious stress between them. Normally, I would have stepped in and tried to mediate, but today I was lacking that ability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying anything, I turned away and made my way to the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A universe away from the stress of Monroe Enterprises was Jack&#39;s workplace. It was a haven I hadn&#39;t known I needed-the cozy lighting, the subtle woodsy and leathery smell, the quiet that seemed to fill the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked in, Jack&#39;s smile lit up the room as he looked up from his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily. To whom do I owe this enjoyment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shrug, I sank into one of the comfy chairs across from him. &#34;I simply needed some time off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back, he inspected me with a mixture of interest and worry. &#34;From Ethan or from work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tensed up, taken aback by his directness. &#34;What leads you to believe that it concerns Ethan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack put down his pen and laughed quietly. &#34;I know you, that&#39;s why. Additionally, ever since Isabella appeared, you&#39;ve been carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rubbed my temples and groaned. &#34;Jack, I&#39;m not sure what to do. I don&#39;t understand why he&#39;s excluding me. I feel as though I no longer matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s voice was stern yet gentle as his face relaxed and he leaned forward. &#34;Emily, you are important. Never question that. You are among the most important individuals in Ethan&#39;s life, even though he may not be aware of it at the moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tightness in my chest grew as I shook my head. &#34;That&#39;s not how it feels.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s hand touched mine as he reached across the desk. &#34;Then show it to him. Let him push you away, but don&#39;t give up quickly. Emily, if I know anything about you, it&#39;s that you don&#39;t give up quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hung in the air, a subdued dare that made me feel something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s words echoed in my head as I left his office, feeling a little more composed. However, as soon as I stepped outdoors, the load of everything fell again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city streets were covered in deep shadows as the sun began to set. I walked aimlessly, hurt and rage whirling through my mind. This was different from Ethan&#39;s usual complexity. This was planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had already made up my mind by the time I reached my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my resolve cemented, I made it to the office early the following morning. Ethan would have to confront me if he meant to ignore me. I would no longer be ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited until Isabella entered Ethan&#39;s office, her usual grace and composure annoying me. Then I closed the door behind me and followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled to see me, she turned. &#34;Emily. Do you require anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the fury roaring inside of me, I met her eyes and spoke steadily. &#34;We must speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella&#39;s surprise soon gave way to interest, and she smiled mischievously. &#34;Obviously. What are you thinking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step closer, determined not to flee. &#34;I&#39;m not going to let you push me away, regardless of what game you&#39;re playing. Ethan isn&#39;t your tool, and this isn&#39;t just your playground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a flash of amusement in her eyes as her smile grew. &#34;You believe I&#39;m teasing you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you are,&#34; I replied, raising my voice. &#34;And I don&#39;t give a damn about what you&#39;re attempting to show. I will not be leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella cocked her head, examining me as if I were a predator assessing its prey. &#34;Brave words, Emily. However, I have some advice for you: attempting to get Ethan&#39;s attention is useless. He has already made up his mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked by the words, yet I didn&#39;t recoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I answered in a cold tone, &#34;We&#39;ll see about that. I don&#39;t quit easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, her smile wavered, and I found satisfaction in the glint of doubt in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not the end of it. By no means.</p>
