                <p>As he gets up and puts on his jacket to go, I lean back in my chair and scream out, &#34;Ethan, before you go.&#34; His face is strained as he turns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah?&#34; he replies, his tone tinged with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I give him a serious look. &#34;Be cautious when you&#39;re out there. You have no idea who might be listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenches his jaw. He understands exactly what I mean. He gives a single, abrupt nod, then walks away silently. I release a breath I didn&#39;t know I was holding as the door clicks shut behind him. The burden of our current situation is bearing down on us both, and it will only increase in weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look back at the pile of papers on my desk. Every page of contracts, transfers, and reports serves as a reminder of how complicated Monroe Enterprises has grown over time. Henry was a clever businessman, but he danced across the line into the shadows rather than merely playing in the gray areas. And now, with me right here in the midst of it all, Ethan is attempting to clean up the mess Henry left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzes against the wood of my desk as I&#39;m going through a particularly thick report, signaling that there&#39;s a call coming in. I look at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Agent Richards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach sinks. Richards giving me a call? This cannot be good. I answer, trying to sound as impartial and cool as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack Turner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Turner! This is Agent Richards.&#34; Richards remarks, &#34;I hope I&#39;m not interrupting anything important,&#34; in an overly informal tone. He seems to know something I don&#39;t, and I can almost see the arrogant smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just another hectic workday,&#34; I respond calmly, maintaining a light tone of voice. &#34;Agent Richards, how may I help you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, nothing significant.&#34; He continues, &#34;Just thought we could have a friendly chat,&#34; but there&#39;s a tone to his voice that makes it obvious that this is not friendly at all. &#34;We&#39;re looking into Monroe Enterprises a little more. You have undoubtedly heard about the ongoing investigation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tighten my hold on the phone. &#34;Yes, I am aware. However, from what I&#39;ve heard, you didn&#39;t have much to work with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very true.&#34; His statements are emphasized by the rhythmic sound of him tapping a pen or other object against his desk. &#34;However, we have discovered some recent information. Intriguing, to put it mildly. Mr. Turner, you know how these things work. It&#39;s like peeling an onion. layer by layer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>New information? I maintain a neutral expression despite his inability to see me. &#34;I&#39;m not sure what you mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards laughs slowly and softly. &#34;Oh, come on, Jack. You&#39;re a really intelligent man. I don&#39;t need to explain it to you. The Monroe name isn&#39;t exactly squeaky clean, is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tone remains stern but courteous as I warn, &#34;Be careful with those accusations. You&#39;re just speculating without proof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speculating, huh?&#34; That arrogance is back. &#34;We&#39;ll find out soon enough, I guess. I figured you could use a heads-up. You seem to have a decent amount of involvement in affairs there. I would hate for you to be caught off guard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carefully consider what I will say next. &#34;Thank you for your care, Agent Richards. However, to the best of my knowledge, Monroe Enterprises has nothing to hide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He repeats, his voice brimming with doubt, &#34;Nothing to hide? I guess we&#39;ll have to decide that. But, Jack, since you&#39;re there in the thick of things, maybe you can help me understand a few irregularities we&#39;re looking at.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trap is getting tighter. &#34;Irregularities?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he replies with ease. &#34;For instance, some of these transactions we&#39;re seeing. They appear... strange. Care to shed any light on that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remain quiet for a while, considering my alternatives. In an attempt to persuade me to divulge something, Richards is searching for anything he can find. I refuse to provide him with the satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you know, Agent Richards, I practice law. All financial information pertaining to Monroe Enterprises is kept private. I would advise following the correct procedures if you require specifics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pauses, and then lets out a sigh. &#34;All right, all right. As I mentioned, I just thought we might have a polite conversation. But I&#39;ll tell you something, Jack: you won&#39;t mind us taking a closer look if Monroe Enterprises has nothing to hide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my jaw. &#34;You can look all you want. Just be ready for legal action if you go too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, lawsuits don&#39;t scare me, Jack. But I&#39;ll take that as your approval to continue our little investigation.&#34; He hesitates, his voice becoming almost joyous. &#34;Who knows? I may visit Monroe Enterprises myself in the near future to have a closer look at things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The threat, barely disguised as a casual comment, is there. I keep my annoyance to myself. &#34;Feel free. I&#39;m sure we&#39;d be happy to accommodate you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great,&#34; he remarks, obviously taking way too much pleasure in this. &#34;I&#39;ll stay in touch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m left clutching the phone, the dial tone vibrating in my ear, as he hangs up before I can reply. Slowly, my mind whirling, I put it down. Richards is preparing to attack us and is assembling evidence piece by piece; he is not bluffing. He will eventually attempt to initiate contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I massage my temples as I recline in my chair. This is not good. Richards has us in hot water if he has any hard proof. I must ensure that everything is completely sealed. There are no loose ends or things he can gnaw on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I keep thinking about what I said earlier: &#34;You never know who&#39;s listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh no. I must caution him. Since Richards&#39; men are most likely observing our every move, I am unable to discuss specifics over the phone or in person. But I had to say something, if only to ensure that he realizes how terrible the issue is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pick up my phone and send him a text: &#34;Be careful what you say. Richards is becoming aggressive. We cannot afford to make any errors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds, my phone pings and he responds, &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brief and direct. Ethan is aware of the danger. However, this goes beyond only safeguarding him or the business; it also aims to keep me out of Richards&#39; crosshairs. If he finds a way to pin this on me, it could ruin everything I&#39;ve worked for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly release my breath while attempting to plan and think. We&#39;ve made it through worse. But this has a different feeling. The walls seem to be closing in faster than we can shove them back this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it seems to me that Richards may soon have enough to proceed. A raid, a warrant if he&#39;s dropping by Monroe Enterprises, he won&#39;t come empty-handed. I must be ready for that and ensure that everything he sees is flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the uneasiness that is gnawing at me won&#39;t go away. And Richards, the FBI doesn&#39;t issue meaningless threats. He is unrelenting. Until he finds something, anything, to pull us under, he will continue to come and chip away at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts are racing as I stand and pace my office. I&#39;ll have to go over all of our records once more, double-check everything, and remind the personnel to behave themselves. Ethan will also need to maintain a low profile. No risks, no slip-ups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzes once more, and Ethan texts me again, asking, &#34;What did Richards say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He may &#34;pay us a visit&#34; in the near future,&#34; I type back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long pause, then his reply: &#34;Got it. Let&#39;s be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold descends on me as I slide the phone into my pocket. Richards is coming, ready or not. And if he gets inside, there&#39;s no telling what he might find.</p>
