                <p>I had been back in Willow Creek for a week, and everything appeared to be going as usual. But Henry Monroe&#39;s shadow followed me no matter how much I tried to lose myself in lesson preparations and homework.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored the pile of ungraded homework in front of me as I sat at my computer and read through yet another story regarding Henry&#39;s business transactions. I was drawn farther into the mystery with each click and each new finding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My focus was disrupted by my phone buzzing. I scowled as I looked down at the screen. Another missed call from Jack. He tried to contact me dozens, if not more, times in the last week, and I had lost track. All of his voicemails had been the same: &#34;Call me back, Emily.&#34; I had stayed away from him, but this is serious. Whatever new warning he had for me, I wasn&#39;t prepared to hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, I set the phone on the desk, face down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Clark?&#34; I was brought back to reality by a tiny voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella was standing in front of me as I looked up, her worried eyes wide. She looked anxiously at the clock while holding her arithmetic book in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurriedly closed my laptop and smiled at Ella, saying, &#34;Sorry, Ella. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whispered, &#34;You haven&#39;t said anything, but we&#39;re supposed to start math. Is everything all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I became aware that I had totally lost track of time, and guilt swept over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up and responded, &#34;Of course,&#34; trying to seem cheerful. &#34;Let&#39;s begin the lesson for today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I strolled over to the whiteboard and started writing out the equations for the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was worn out by the time break arrived. Mentally, not physically. Trying to keep Henry and the danger I was in out of my mind, I had spent the entire morning focusing on my kids. However, it was failing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the kids left the classroom for lunch, I leaned back in my chair and massaged my temples. I knew I couldn&#39;t continue like this. It was all going to catch up with me sooner or later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the screen as my phone buzzed once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>18 missed calls from Jack Turner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back in my chair and moaned. He couldn&#39;t leave me alone for five minutes; what was so important? Even though he had previously advised me to avoid investigating Henry&#39;s past, I couldn&#39;t ignore it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored the nagging nervousness in my chest and placed the phone down again. Whatever Jack was trying to tell me, I wasn&#39;t prepared to face it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sensation of being watched returned to me that afternoon while I was standing outdoors observing the children during recess. It had been happening on and off since I returned to Willow Creek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around the schoolyard, where the kids were having fun on the jungle gym and swings. As usual, everything appeared to be as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to dismiss it, to convince myself that I was simply being paranoid once more, when I saw someone standing near the playground&#39;s chain-link fence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tall, with sunglasses and a dark coat. He was just watching me while keeping his hands in his pockets. He wasn&#39;t looking at the kids. He wasn&#39;t doing anything but staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood drained from my face, and my heart skipped a beat. Was it the same New York man? The person who had previously followed me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other teachers were busy with their own pupils, laughing and joking as if nothing was wrong, so I glanced around, thinking someone else had noticed him. I was the only one who appeared to notice the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a wave of panic as I realized he was not leaving. He waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Clark?&#34; My attention was drawn to Ella&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to look down at Ella, who was extending a jump rope. &#34;Can you help me with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to maintain a steady voice while forcing a smile. &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped to my knees to assist her with the rope, but my gaze kept returning to the man standing by the gate. He remained there, continuing watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts were racing as I rushed the children back inside as the bell rung to announce the break was over. I had to find out who he was and why he was here. Above all else, though, I had to know if I was in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurriedly packed up my stuff after school since I was anxious to leave the building and return to my apartment&#39;s safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sensed a presence behind me as I made my way toward the exit via the lonely hallways, someone approaching a bit too closely. I sped up, breathing more rapidly as I heard footsteps bouncing off the walls. They were after me, whomever it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I turned the corner, the man I had seen before was standing right in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a lightning strike, fear swept through me. I came to a halt, my heart pounding. &#34;Who are you?&#34; With a quivering voice, I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man took a while to respond. He merely observed me while standing there. Then he stepped forward carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said in a low, threatening voice, &#34;You must stop digging. You&#39;re getting too close to things that don&#39;t concern you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my heart thumping in my chest, I stepped back. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though examining me, the man tilted his head. &#34;Emily, you have no business knowing about Henry Monroe&#39;s history. And if you keep pushing, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth became parched. &#34;How do you know my name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no warmth in his smile. &#34;I know everything about you. And trust me, you don&#39;t want to know the things I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the panic gnawing at my throat, I made myself remain composed. &#34;Is that a threat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a warning,&#34; he stated. &#34;You don&#39;t know who you&#39;re dealing with. Walk away while you still can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and left, vanishing into the late afternoon light before I could reply. I stood still, my mind whirling. I was so restless to call Jack and let him know what had happened that my hands were shaking as I took out my telephone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then something kept me from dialing his number. I felt shudders down my spine as I recalled the man&#39;s warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You don&#39;t know who you&#39;re dealing with.</p>
