                <p>The journey to the Skyline Club seemed more drawn out than expected. While driving, my fingers were restless on the wheel, my thoughts filled with excitement for what was to come. Upon my arrival, the valet gave a nod of acknowledgement, his gaze lingering on me briefly as if he knew who I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came in, and there was Victor, standing by the marble staircase in his normal arrogant serenity. His expression didn&#39;t give anything away, but the small smirk at the corner of his mouth told me he was enjoying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re late,&#34; he observed, not bothering to hide his enjoyment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Traffic,&#34; I murmured, thrusting my hands in my pockets. &#34;So, what&#39;s this meeting about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a small chuckle. &#34;Patience, Ethan. Tonight is about introductions.&#34; He nodded towards the huge ballroom immediately beyond the entryway. &#34;You&#39;re about to meet the people your father kept close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed his gaze, my anxiety building as I took in the space beyond-a dazzling hall filled with the kind of power most people only hear about in whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor led the way, maneuvering among small groups of people in cut suits and beautiful gowns. They regarded him with reverence, but when their eyes focused on me, I could feel the scrutiny, the mistrust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victor,&#34; one man hailed, raising a glass. He had salt-and-pepper hair and sported a watch that screamed old money. His attention went to me, lingering. &#34;Is this Henry&#39;s boy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor smiled. &#34;Indeed. Everyone, this is Ethan Monroe.&#34; He waved towards me as if I were some rare specimen he was showing off. &#34;He&#39;ll be picking up where Henry left off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman with emerald-green eyes uttered a low giggle, crossed her arms. &#34;Is that right? He looks young.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my teeth, matching her stare. &#34;I&#39;m here, aren&#39;t I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyebrow raised, evidently unimpressed. &#34;Being here and being ready are two different things, Mr. Monroe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; Victor said smoothly, staring at the woman. &#34;Let&#39;s give him a chance to prove himself. Henry trusted him, and I trust him too.&#34; His grasp on my shoulder increased, urging me to be silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silver-haired man from before leaned closer, dropping his voice. &#34;Victor, if he&#39;s going to be part of our circle, he needs to understand what&#39;s at stake. Does he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor gazed at me, his expression opaque. &#34;Ethan understands well enough. Don&#39;t you Ethan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed, keeping my look deadpan even as my gut twisted. &#34;I know why I&#39;m here,&#34; I said, my tone tougher than I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s sneer grew. &#34;Good. Because tonight is just the beginning, Ethan. I thought it was time for you to see the wider picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another man, who I knew as a state senator, approached us, his face taut. &#34;Victor, are you sure bringing him here was wise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor nodded confidently. &#34;I know what I&#39;m doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The senator eyed me, apparently suspicious. &#34;Your father had a way of managing things, Ethan. Can you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could react, Victor cut in. &#34;Let him prove himself. Henry would desire that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a murmur of agreement, but the senator&#39;s countenance didn&#39;t soften. He leaned down, dropping his voice so only Victor and I could hear. &#34;I just hope your judgment is right, Victor. We don&#39;t need any weaknesses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor gave him a reassuring smile. &#34;You have nothing to worry about. Ethan is exactly where he needs to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the weight of their gazes, the silent challenges in their eyes. I had gone into my father&#39;s world, but it was evident that I was still on the outside, looking in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the evening unfolded, I moved from discussion to conversation, following Victor&#39;s lead. Every face I met carried some level of uncertainty, some glimmer of suspicion. The more I spoke, the more I realized just how deep my father&#39;s links ran. This wasn&#39;t just about business or money-it was about power, influence, control. And every one of these folks had a stake in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Victor pulled me aside, his look serious. &#34;How are you holding up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a nod. &#34;Fine. This is more than I expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, clapping a hand on my back. &#34;Get used to it, Ethan. This is your life now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could react, a familiar voice pierced through the murmur of chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, isn&#39;t this a surprise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to see the woman with green eyes from earlier, now sneering at me with barely veiled enjoyment. She raised a glass. &#34;To the next generation of Monroe,&#34; she continued, the venom pouring from her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s jaw tensed, but he kept his tone smooth. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Ethan will surprise you all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Victor, unsure if he genuinely believed that or if he was just playing his part. Either way, the evening had made one thing clear-these folks expected me to be just like my father. And if I wasn&#39;t, they&#39;d find someone else who could fill the role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night drew on, Victor began to introduce me to other members in his group. Each greeting, each forced grin, seemed like additional weight crushing down on me, reminding me of the expectations I was required to fulfill. But underlying it all, a part of me wondered if I even wanted this existence. The more I saw, the more I realized just how intertwined my father had been, and now I was being sucked in, step by step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, when I thought the night was winding down, Victor leaned in, lowering his voice. &#34;There&#39;s one more person I want you to meet. She&#39;s been active for years, and her influence might be valuable to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, following him as he took me towards a remote area of the room where a tall, severe-looking woman stood, monitoring the crowd with a piercing glance. When we reached her, Victor grinned, gesturing towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, meet Ms. Caldwell,&#34; he began, his tone courteous. &#34;She was one of Henry&#39;s trusted allies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ms. Caldwell&#39;s eyes narrowed, scrutinizing me with a glance that made my skin crawl. &#34;So, this is the son. Tell me, Ethan, are you as ambitious as your father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, selecting my words carefully. &#34;I&#39;m here to learn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled, though there was no comedy in her eyes. &#34;Learning won&#39;t be enough. If you want to survive in this world, you&#39;ll need to prove yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor placed a hand on my shoulder, his grip tight. &#34;He will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ms. Caldwell&#39;s stare stayed on me for a bit longer before she nodded, as if satisfied. &#34;We&#39;ll see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and disappeared into the crowd, leaving me alone with Victor. He offered me a faint smile, apparently happy with the impact I&#39;d made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not bad, Ethan,&#34; he whispered. &#34;You&#39;re starting to understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when I surveyed the room and saw the anxious eyes of those watching me, I felt a growing sense of fear. They were not only friends, but also predators, ready to pounce on any sign of vulnerability. And in their world, vulnerability was death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tonight was just a taste, Ethan. These people they&#39;re the ones who have the true power. If you can acquire their trust, your potential is limitless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a nod, though my thoughts was racing. &#34;And if I don&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s smile was frigid. &#34;Then they&#39;ll tear you apart. Just like they did with anyone who crossed your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit me like a blow to the belly, and I realized just how dangerous this world was. But I couldn&#39;t back out now. Not without putting everything-and everyone-I cared about at risk.</p>
