                <p>As Ethan entered Jack&#39;s office, his eyes darted around the room, briefly focusing on me before turning back to Jack. His look was composed, almost unconcerned, but I knew better than to believe it. He was always quite good at hiding how he really felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack, you called us here?&#34; Ethan spoke in a bland tone, as though the meeting were a small annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suppressed a groan as a mix of intrigue and frustration rose inside me. Our relationship had remained unsettled after Paris. It got worse when I saw him now, behaving so distant and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind his desk, Jack glanced between us, his face unreadable. Yes, I did believe it was time for us to talk about some significant issues. You both need to be aware of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following me in, Sophie was watching the entire situation with wide eyes. Evidently sensing the tension, she glanced from Jack to Ethan. But Ethan&#39;s piercing eyes found her just when I thought things would get heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a private matter,&#34; he remarked curtly, &#34;if you don&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie blinked, obviously surprised. She watched me, awaiting my signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded slightly and shot her a pitying glance. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Soph. I will speak with you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still a little stunned, Sophie nodded and squeezed my arm comfortingly before leaving, giving me one final inquisitive glance over her shoulder as she shut the door. Now that there were only the three of us in the room, it felt even smaller, and the tension was increased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack leaned forward, staring at us with a serious gaze. &#34;I didn&#39;t call you two here for nothing. This isn&#39;t just about business. It&#39;s about your safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan arched an eyebrow in a tone that was brimming with indifference. &#34;Safety? What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack maintained eye contact. &#34;I am referring to Victor Alvarez.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name hung like a black cloud in the atmosphere. My gut constricted as I thought back to the rumors I had heard about Victor, even though no one had ever given me the whole truth. Ethan&#39;s countenance wavered in the meantime, but he immediately covered it up with a casual shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s Victor Alvarez?&#34; He inquired in a casual manner, as though the name didn&#39;t mean anything to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s eyes narrowed, catching Ethan&#39;s feigned ignorance. &#34;Ethan, don&#39;t play games with me. You are well aware of Victor&#39;s identity. You are also aware of the danger he poses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Ethan&#39;s mouth tightened, but he faked a sloppy laugh. &#34;Are you sure you can just sway me to believe a conspiracy theory?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost and furious, I glanced between them. &#34;Could someone please tell me the identity of this Victor Alvarez and his connection to our father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack let out a sigh and gave me a dejected glance. &#34;Your father had a tight friendship with Victor Alvarez, but their relationship went beyond business as usual. Victor engaged in a number of illegal activities, and your father was a partner in them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fragments of my father&#39;s life that I had finally come to understand broke into something darker, and my heart fell. &#34;Are you implying that our father engaged in illegal activity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack gave a nod. &#34;Yes. Monroe Enterprises served as a front for Victor&#39;s activities in addition to being a respectable company. Arms dealings, among other things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Ethan, expecting a response that would indicate he was just as surprised as I was. Instead, he folded his arms across his chest and maintained a blank expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, how does that relate to us at this point?&#34; Ethan&#39;s tone was contemptuous and icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack stared at him, a trace of annoyance visible. &#34;Everything, Ethan. Victor expects Monroe Enterprises to continue the way it did under Henry. And I have reason to believe he&#39;s already been in contact with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan laughed briefly and without humor. &#34;You think I&#39;m working with some criminal mastermind? That&#39;s a stretch, even for you, Jack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s face became stern. &#34;Don&#39;t insult my intelligence. I know you&#39;ve been in touch with him. You may think you&#39;re keeping it under control, but you&#39;re playing a dangerous game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a contemptuous tone, Ethan shot out, &#34;Believe what you want, Jack. Your theories are not relevant to me at this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled to make sense of what was occurring as I watched them both, my thoughts spinning. &#34;So our father&#39;s business was a front all along? And Victor he expects us to keep things running?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack gave a nod. &#34;Exactly. And if you two don&#39;t play along, Victor won&#39;t just let you walk away. He&#39;s not the kind of man to leave loose ends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s tone was sharp as he scoffed. &#34;And I guess you know everything there is to know about him now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack ignored Ethan&#39;s remark and turned to face me. &#34;I didn&#39;t want to involve you in this, Emily, but there isn&#39;t much else we can do. You need to know the risks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan interrupted, his voice tinged with annoyance. &#34;Jack, she doesn&#39;t have to know anything. Stop dragging her into your paranoia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s displeasure was visible as he tightened his jaw. &#34;Ethan, this isn&#39;t paranoia. This is the truth. And it&#39;s best if you both realize that as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their statements were abrasive and full of accusations, and I could feel the tension between them growing. My own concerns were only strengthened by Ethan&#39;s unwillingness to acknowledge anything. I couldn&#39;t determine who to trust, and it felt like the ground beneath me was moving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, if you&#39;re involved with Victor&#34; My voice trembled as I started. &#34;You must be honest if you&#39;re hiding anything from us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief moment of something unreadable appeared in Ethan&#39;s eyes as we locked eyes, and he swiftly averted his gaze. &#34;Don&#39;t allow Jack&#39;s paranoia affect you, Emily. I don&#39;t know anything about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack snorted in frustration. &#34;Ethan, this isn&#39;t paranoia. Victor poses a threat. If you keep pretending you can handle him on your own, you&#39;ll end up dragging us all down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s stance tightened as he tried to keep up his act of indifference, his hands clenched. &#34;This is a useless conversation, Jack. I&#39;m not engaged in any criminal activity. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re so determined to believe otherwise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s gaze was unwavering, yet his voice grew softer. I&#39;ve known you long enough to recognize when you&#39;re trying to hide something, Ethan. Don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking you can keep this under wraps forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan gave Jack a scowl, obviously irritated by his insistence. &#34;Jack, you&#39;re going too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack retorted, &#34;And you&#39;re endangering all of us. I need to know the truth in order to protect you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I tried to digest everything, I felt conflicted and torn. My suspicion that something was wrong and that Jack might be correct grew stronger the more I observed Ethan. However, my perplexity and annoyance were only increased by Ethan&#39;s obstinate reluctance to acknowledge anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;Ethan,&#34; in a voice that was almost audible. &#34;Why are you acting this way if you&#39;re not actually involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His quiet spoke volumes as he remained silent and kept his eyes on the ground.</p>
