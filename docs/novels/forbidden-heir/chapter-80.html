                <p>&#34;I&#39;m speaking to you, Ethan!&#34; Desperation made it difficult to conceal my fury, but I attempted to stay calm, and my voice cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before calling it a day, I had returned to his office to go over a few last details, but he claimed that I didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look up from his laptop at all. His fingers moved across the keys as if they were on their own. The stress in the room seemed to be building toward an explosion, and his jaw was clenched. The sound of the rain outside and the gentle hum of the heater were unable to melt the cold air between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was harsh and contemptuous as he said, &#34;Not now, Emily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an attempt to regain my calm, I inhaled deeply. I couldn&#39;t control my annoyance as I said, &#34;That&#39;s all you ever say lately.&#34; The weight of the space between us seemed to be drawing us farther apart as I took a step toward him. &#34;You&#39;re excluding me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a sigh and eventually raised his gaze to mine. His eyes were icy and far away. It hurt more than I thought it would. &#34;Are you okay? I&#39;m taking it. Give me some space, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Space?&#34; Trembling with a mixture of anger and hurt, I raised my voice. &#34;Ethan, I&#39;m here to try to help! It seems like you&#39;re struggling to hold it together, and I&#39;m worried about you. But you continue to push me away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snapped his laptop shut, making me cringe. &#34;Because you are unable to assist!&#34; He seemed to be trying to cut through the talk with his sharp voice. &#34;You&#39;re not aware of the stakes involved. You are unable to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His comments were like a kick to the stomach. I folded my arms across my chest after standing there for a second in shock. &#34;Then tell me,&#34; I whispered quietly, almost begging. &#34;Ethan, I&#39;m not asking for much. Simply speak with me. Let me in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something-perhaps regret-flitted across his face. Anguish? I was unable to tell. But just as quickly, his face stiffened again. He turned back to his laptop and shook his head. &#34;At this moment, I don&#39;t have time for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was it. The last wall between us crashed down. As I turned and left, the door clicking louder than I had meant, my chest constricted, and I blinked back tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slight smell of coffee permeated the air below, yet it was unsettling. I collapsed onto the couch and looked out at the raindrops cascading like small rivers down the glass. The dreary metropolis outside matched my sense of emptiness and washed-outness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked out of my trance by a knock at the door. Sophie was standing there, looking untidy when I opened it. She gripped her bag tightly as if it were the only thing keeping her together, and her eyes were tired, shadowed by dark circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was hardly heard above a whisper when she said, &#34;Emily.&#34; She entered without waiting for an introduction. &#34;I must speak with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concerned by how pale she was, I motioned for her to sit. &#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie sat on the edge of the couch and fidgeted with the bag strap. Her voice faltered as she admitted, &#34;I&#39;ve made mistakes. Large ones. I&#39;m afraid they&#39;re all catching up to me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt sick to my stomach. Sophie always kept her composure in the face of adversity. It scared me to see her so shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What sort of mistakes?&#34; I asked carefully, since I needed to know but didn&#39;t want to press too hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With tears in her eyes, she shook her head. &#34;At this time, I am unable to tell you everything. However, Emily, I apologize. I&#39;m so sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you sorry for?&#34; I grasped the edge of the couch and leaned forward. &#34;You&#39;re frightening me, Sophie. What are you not telling me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing down at her lap, she paused. &#34;I have been withholding information from you. From Ethan as well. However, it&#39;s not what you believe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I extended my hand and put it over hers. &#34;Whatever it is, Sophie, we&#39;ll find a solution. But you must be frank with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, her lips pulled together, but she stayed silent. The knot in my gut only grew tighter as she stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed something on Ethan&#39;s desk later that night when I went into his office to bring a file he had left below. A rumpled letter, folded carelessly, with Gerard&#39;s name clearly written in black ink across the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my heart beating in my chest, I looked at the closed door. I unwrapped the letter unwillingly. My blood ran cold when I read those words:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is your last warning, Ethan. You misjudged Victor the last time, and we both know what happened. Avoid making the same error twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands shaking, I gazed at the letter. It was clear from Gerard&#39;s tone that this was more than a warning. It was dangerous. With my thoughts racing, I refolded the note and put it exactly where I had found it. What had happened between Victor and Ethan? What mistake did Gerard tell him not to make again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked when my phone buzzed in my pocket. When I took it out, I saw Ethan&#39;s name. My first reaction was to call him. The constant ringing of the phone aggravated my already strained nerves. It went to voicemail at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to speak calmly as I said, &#34;Call me back, Ethan. We must speak. Right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at the phone as if I could wish it to ring, I hung up. However, it stayed quiet. The atmosphere was disturbingly silent now that the rain had stopped outside. I felt overwhelmed by the weight of everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was getting to be too much for me. We were being pulled apart by Ethan&#39;s lies, and I wasn&#39;t sure how much longer I could hold on.</p>
