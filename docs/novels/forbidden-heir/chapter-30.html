                <p>&#34;Ethan...&#34; As we separated, I whispered, still feeling the warmth of his lips. However, the passionate, conflicted expression in his eyes prevented me from continuing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry,&#34; he mumbled, taking a sudden step back. His tense expression suggested that he was attempting to suppress feelings that were attempting to come to the surface. I stood there, confused and uncertain, while he drew in a short breath and turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His every step echoed in the room&#39;s silence as I watched him leave. Ethan vanished into his bedroom and shut the door before I could say anything more. Its sound stuck in my mind like a conclusion I didn&#39;t want to face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated for a second; what had happened? How could we get to that... kiss after being at professional distance? And why did it feel like everything between us had suddenly changed, as if we were on the precipice of something from which we would never be able to recover?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The penthouse felt oddly quiet the following morning. He wasn&#39;t there when I padded in my pajamas into the kitchen. No breakfast, no coffee cup. Half expecting him to enter from another room, I looked about, but it was obvious that he had already left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a sigh and massaged my temples as I relived the events of the previous evening. The kiss. It was almost as though he regretted the sudden way he had pushed away. Did he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We needed to cooperate. We shared a home. With everything being so unstable, we couldn&#39;t afford to make things much more complicated. However much I tried to convince myself of that, I couldn&#39;t help but notice how my heart jumped when his lips met mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I got to the office, I tried to get rid of the anxiety that made my chest tight by taking a big breath before getting out of the elevator. I couldn&#39;t let last night&#39;s events to influence my behavior today. This was work. I had to concentrate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not as easy as it seems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I passed Ethan&#39;s office, he was already there. The tension from the previous night suddenly came back to life when our eyes briefly locked through the glass wall. He swiftly averted his gaze and returned his focus to the papers on his desk, acting as though I hadn&#39;t been there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my heartbeat quicken as I swallowed forcefully. Alright. I would also pretend that last night had never happened if he did. I would maintain professionalism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a seat at my desk, looked at a few reports, and tried to concentrate on the task at hand. However, my mind kept returning to that kiss each time I looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a little start as I heard Ben&#39;s voice. I hadn&#39;t even seen him enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a grin and said, &#34;Good morning,&#34; as he sank into the chair across from my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben leaned back with his typical easy smile, but his eyes were piercing. &#34;So, how are things going between you and Ethan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat skipped in my chest. &#34;We&#39;re all right. Busy, but alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben answered in a nonchalant tone, &#34;Uh-huh,&#34; but I could tell he wasn&#39;t buying it. &#34;Are you certain? since he has been behaving strangely. More than normal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made an effort to maintain a neutral expression, but I could sense the strain in my body. Was there anything Ben knew? Was there a change between Ethan and me that he could sense?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to sidestep it by saying, &#34;Ethan&#39;s just been dealing with a lot lately. With everything else and the FBI breathing down our necks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s eyes were keen, and he arched an eyebrow. &#34;And it&#39;s just that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was I meant to say, even if I didn&#39;t want to lie? That everything between Ethan and myself was a bewildering muddle when I kissed him last night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mustered a second smile. &#34;That&#39;s all, yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben didn&#39;t seem persuaded. &#34;Look, I&#39;m just warning you to exercise caution. Things between you two, whatever they are, could quickly get problematic because Ethan has a lot on his plate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was able to nod. &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben stared at me for a moment and then got up. &#34;Okay, just to check in. I will see you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a trembling breath as he left, attempting to stop my mind from racing. With my heart racing, I turned to look toward Ethan&#39;s office once more. We couldn&#39;t ignore this any longer. It was all going to boil over sooner or later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meetings and tense silences dominated the remainder of the day. Even though Ethan and I spoke briefly during work-related conversations, there was no denying the tension that had developed between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was emotionally spent by the middle of the afternoon. I made the decision to stop and go to Jack&#39;s office. Perhaps engrossing myself in my job would help me forget about the deteriorating situation between Ethan and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack was already sitting behind his desk in his office when I walked in, watching me with his fists clenched. Something in his gaze made me uneasy right away, as if he was assessing me and examining every motion I made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily,&#34; Jack said in a polite tone. &#34;Take a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief moment of hesitation, I took the chair across from him. &#34;Is everything okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s eyes narrowed as he leaned forward. &#34;I&#39;ve been hearing things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel the strain creeping up my spine, and my pulse missed a beat. &#34;Things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About you and Ethan,&#34; Jack went on, his tone steady but somewhat acerbic. &#34;People are beginning to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he talking about? Were folks able to discern that we were having a relationship? We ourselves had hardly recognized it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing is happening,&#34; I answered defensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack, obviously unconvinced, arched an eyebrow. &#34;Is that correct?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though my heart was pounding, I nodded. &#34;We&#39;re just working together. Not much more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; said Jack, leaning back in his chair. &#34;Because you and Ethan won&#39;t be the only ones harmed if things become messy. The stake is Monroe Enterprises. Remember that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s comments were still ringing in my head when I left his office. He had some knowledge. He may not have all the information, but he had enough suspicions. The worst part was that he was correct. We couldn&#39;t afford for whatever was going on between Ethan and me to get out of hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind was a jumbled mess as I made my way back to my workspace. And that kiss... that kiss had only made things worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty weighing heavily on my heart, I looked toward Ethan&#39;s office. Jack&#39;s words were still echoing in my head, and I was certain that everything would fall apart if we weren&#39;t careful.</p>
