                <p>&#34;You blindsided us, Ethan!&#34; Jack yelled and rushed into my office, slamming the door behind him. Ben trailed closely behind, his face gloomy. &#34;Why in the world would you announce that without informing us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to remain composed as I reclined in my chair. &#34;It had to be done. Emily wasn&#39;t safe in Willow Creek. She had to come back, and the media would&#39;ve found her eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben raised his hands in the air. &#34;But you didn&#39;t think to give us a heads-up? Now she&#39;s in the spotlight, and we have no control over the narrative! Not to mention the press is all over her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t wait for approval,&#34; I shot back. &#34;This was the only way to get her out of there, and it was my decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack squinted his eyes. &#34;Your decision? Emily is now in much greater risk because of you. And now we&#39;re exposed; everyone is watching us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got out of my chair, growing impatient. &#34;We were exposed the moment my father died. It has nothing to do with the press. It&#39;s about having control over what happens next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben leaned against the wall with his arms crossed. &#34;Do you think this is control? Emily finds herself in the center of this media frenzy. She has too much on her plate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a headshake. &#34;She will be alright. When she returns to New York, I will be able to handle things. Here, she will be safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Safe?&#34; Jack laughed. &#34;Perhaps from the media. But what about the rest of it? You are aware of the stakes. Ethan, you&#39;re playing with fire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth, my anger exploding. &#34;I had no other option. I did what had to be done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed before anyone could answer. I frowned as I looked down at the screen and noticed a message from an unidentified number that read, We need to talk. Urgent</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack took note of my face and moved in closer. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of hesitation, I shook my head. &#34;Nothing important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben scowled. &#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking my jacket from the back of my chair, I mumbled, &#34;I&#39;ll take care of it. This conversation is over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed by them and made my way to the door without saying anything else. I wanted room to think, space. One thing Jack and Ben were correct about was that things were getting out of control and I wasn&#39;t sure how long I could control them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was about to reach the elevator, two big men in suits suddenly obstructed my way. Their presence was immediately unsettling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them whispered, &#34;Mr. Monroe,&#34; in a low, authoritative voice. &#34;You need to come with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze. &#34;Who the hell are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other man came forward. &#34;Mr. Alvarez wants to speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alvarez Victor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept a straight face despite being gripped with fear. &#34;I don&#39;t have time to deal with this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man expressed, &#34;You don&#39;t have a choice,&#34; in a tone that made it clear this wasn&#39;t a request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could answer, they held onto me by the arms and pulled me toward the lift. I made an unsuccessful attempt to pull free. These men weren&#39;t here to bargain; they were pros.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the windows tinted so darkly that I couldn&#39;t even determine where we were headed, the SUV rushed through the city. Between the two men, I sat silently, my thoughts racing. Victor Alvarez was a name I knew well, too well. My father had worked with him and kept him close, but I never knew the details. I thought I was going to find out now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We pulled into an underground garage and the car slowed. The men pulled the door open, hauled me out, and dragged me along a little corridor that smelled of wet concrete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stopped in front of a metal door and knocked twice. It opened instantly, revealing a high-ceilinged, darkly lit space. Victor Alvarez was standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a well fitted suit, he stood in the center of the room with his dark hair slicked back and a composed smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Monroe,&#34; Victor said in a calm tone. &#34;It&#39;s been a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a frowning look. &#34;Kidnapping me wasn&#39;t necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor laughed and pointed to a chair in the middle of the space. &#34;Please have a seat. This is a business meeting, not a kidnapping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some hesitation, I sat down. The two men watched me intently from the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor approached with an unwavering smile. &#34;Your father was a good man. ambitious. And extremely... resourceful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I folded my arms. &#34;If this is about my father&#39;s dealings with you, those ended when he died.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s smile dimmed a bit. &#34;Your father&#39;s debt didn&#39;t die with him, Ethan. You inherited it. Monroe Enterprises was built on more than just real estate and investments. There were other... operations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands squeezed beneath the table. &#34;What sort of operations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arms deals,&#34; Victor answered nonchalantly, as though he were talking about a business lunch. &#34;Monroe Enterprises was the perfect front for moving weapons, very discreet, very profitable. And now, you&#39;re in charge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blood ran cold when I heard it presented this way, even though I had always thought my father had more sinister activities. &#34;I&#39;m not getting involved in that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor smiled more broadly. &#34;You have no other option. Your father owed me a lot, and that debt is yours now. You will either lose everything or carry on with the operations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clinched my teeth and muttered, &#34;I don&#39;t care about the money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor answered, lowering his voice to a perilous whisper, &#34;It&#39;s not just about the money. It has to do with power. Command. Monroe Enterprises will fail if you don&#39;t, and everyone who depends on it will go down with you. The board, the investors, your employees, they&#39;ll all know you failed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a raised eyebrow. &#34;What if I expose you? What if I go to the authorities?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s laugh was hollow. &#34;You think the authorities don&#39;t know? Ethan, your father had high-ranking acquaintances. I also do. If you try to cross me, you won&#39;t just lose your company. You&#39;ll lose your freedom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was racing in my ears as I looked at him. He had me trapped, and he knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s eyes met mine as he leaned closer. &#34;You have one week to decide. Continue the operations, or everything you and your father built will burn to the ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, my thoughts whirling. I had to decide whether to join Victor and carry on my father&#39;s illicit enterprise or to turn my back and watch it all come crashing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor adjusted his suit jacket and straightened. &#34;I&#39;ll be in touch.&#34;</p>
