                <p>As I passed by, the clerk whispered, &#34;Isabella is in Ethan&#39;s office again.&#34; She smiled politely at me, but I felt a knot form in my gut from the glimmer of curiosity in her eyes. She wasn&#39;t to blame. People talked, especially after someone like Isabella had come in and taken over every meeting, chat, and free moment of the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed a tight smile and nodded before making my way down the hallway. The sound of my heels clicking on the shiny floor was louder than usual in the calm of the late afternoon. The door to Ethan&#39;s office was shut when I arrived. Through the thick wood, I could hear the faint hum of voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed there, hand on the doorknob, for a second. Isabella&#39;s laugh filled the space-it was sweet and light, the kind that made everyone lean in closer. Then, in a softer, calmer, but clearly engaged tone, Ethan answered. My chest tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily?&#34; I was surprised by Sophie&#39;s voice behind me. I turned to see her standing there, holding a coffee, her expression a mix of worry and curiosity. &#34;Hey, are you free for lunch? You look like you could use a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced back at the door and paused. I didn&#39;t want to intrude on whatever was happening inside. &#34;Yeah. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what&#39;s actually going on?&#34; We were sitting in a small café down the block when Sophie asked. The smell of coffee and fresh bread filled the air, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to care. She had been picking at her salad, watching me with a mixture of worry and intrigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; I said absently, stirring my soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been busy ever since I walked in, Emily. Let&#39;s not pretend I didn&#39;t notice you hanging around outside Ethan&#39;s office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my spoon down and sighed. &#34;It&#39;s just... Isabella Cortez. She&#39;s everywhere lately. Every time I turn around, she&#39;s with Ethan-late nights, talks, presentations. It&#39;s like she&#39;s taken over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isabella?&#34; Sophie raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. She&#39;s a new expert working with us.&#34; I added quickly, trying to downplay it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;And you think something&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I admitted. &#34;Ethan&#39;s not usually like this. He&#39;s always been careful, distant even. But with her... it&#39;s different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie leaned forward, dropping her voice. &#34;Have you talked to him about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;Every time I try, he brushes it off. Says he doesn&#39;t have time for distractions because the business is in an important stage. I&#39;m not even sure he knows he&#39;s pushing me away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie reached across the table and squeezed my hand. &#34;You need to stand up for yourself, Emily. You need to voice your worries, especially if they&#39;re bothering you. You&#39;re not just a supporting role in his life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her a small smile as I pulled my hand back. &#34;It&#39;s not that simple. This business... this whole world is so much bigger than me. And Isabella? She fits. She&#39;s skilled, confident, and exactly what the company needs right now. I&#39;m not sure I still belong here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie scowled. &#34;That&#39;s not true. She has every right to be here, and so do you. Don&#39;t let her push you aside. Ethan needs to be reminded of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at my watch. I was running late. &#34;Thanks, Sophie. I&#39;ve got to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I left, I didn&#39;t look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I returned to the office, night had fallen. The building was eerily quiet, save for the faraway hum of cleaning crews. Most people had already gone home. With Sophie&#39;s words still heavy on my mind, I dropped my bag onto my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget Ethan,&#34; I whispered to myself. It wasn&#39;t as easy as it sounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was looking through the papers for the day when I heard faint voices down the hall-low, steady murmurs. Ethan&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood, moving carefully, my curiosity gnawing at me. The door was slightly ajar, just enough to give me a glimpse inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan sat at his desk, his tie undone and sleeves rolled up. He looked tired but focused. Isabella stood on the other side of him, leaning against the desk, her hand just inches from his, resting lightly on the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was strong, yet fun. &#34;You&#39;re pushing too hard on the expectations. You need to trust the process.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan chuckled softly. &#34;I&#39;m not exactly good at trusting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella&#39;s speech dropped to a more intimate, almost personal tone. &#34;Then let me prove it to you.&#34; She reached across and slid a piece of paper back toward him. &#34;We&#39;re all in this together. You don&#39;t have to do it alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she spoke his name sent a chill down my spine. It was too personal, too familiar. And my stomach churned as I saw the way Ethan looked at her-there was respect in his gaze, but something else, too, something I couldn&#39;t quite place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped back, my breath catching in my throat. As I turned to leave, their talk lingered in the hallway, soft and distant, and the corridor seemed colder, darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned to my desk, but my mind was spinning. I tried to focus on the papers in front of me, but the words blurred together. Ethan and Isabella-her easy closeness, the way he laughed, the way their eyes locked in silent understanding-everything about that moment replayed in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, I felt isolated in Ethan&#39;s world. It was more than just the late nights, the meetings, and the work. It was Isabella. She had filled the space I hadn&#39;t even realized was missing, filling a place I once thought was mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I left the office, the city was cloaked in darkness. The normal hustle and bustle had been replaced by the distant hum of traffic and the occasional sound of footsteps on the pavement. The streets were eerily quiet. My coat offered little protection against the biting cold as I walked quickly, but the chill seemed to seep deeper, settling in my bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about Sophie&#39;s words. &#34;You must stand up for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how? When someone doesn&#39;t even know they&#39;ve stopped paying attention to you, how do you fight for it? Isabella seemed like the perfect fit for the part she was playing in Ethan&#39;s life-how could I possibly compete with that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped when I reached my car, glancing back at the towering skyscraper. Ethan and Isabella were likely still inside, working, making plans, building something I was no longer a part of. The lights on the upper floors burned brightly, a reminder of all I&#39;d lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep ache settled in my chest as the thought gripped me. I climbed into the driver&#39;s seat and looked out over the city, holding the wheel tightly. Somewhere along the way, I had lost my place. And now, I had no idea how to get it back.</p>
