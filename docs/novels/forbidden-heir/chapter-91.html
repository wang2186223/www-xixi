                <p>I held the door open for Isabella as we got into the lift and said, &#34;She&#39;ll calm down eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she looked at me, she made a mean smile with her lips. &#34;You seem incredibly certain of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged as I leaned against the mirror wall of the lift. &#34;Emily tends to make things sound worse than they are.&#34; She&#39;ll change her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella cocked her head and looked at me with her sharp, alert eyes. &#34;You don&#39;t seem overly worried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;m not,&#34; I said, but the tightness in my chest made it look like I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a minute, neither of us said anything as the elevator hummed softly while falling. I could feel her eyes on me, looking for something hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella finally said in a quieter tone, &#34;She cares about you. That much is clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp breath, I combed through my hair. &#34;It&#39;s not always easier when you care. It merely makes things more difficult sometimes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella&#39;s eyebrow raised. &#34;You also don&#39;t do complicated things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked slightly as I answered, &#34;Not if I can help it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We entered the hallway once the elevator doors slid open. The sleek black car, shining under the city lights, was already waiting outside for me. I led Isabella to the car, opened the door for her, and slipped in next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restaurant was one of my favorites; it was a classy, peaceful spot away from the bustle of the city center. Isabella&#39;s eyes flashed with admiration at the atmosphere as we sat at a quiet corner table. A gentle hum of classical music, tasteful décor, and soft lighting all added to the intimate ambiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her clutch on the table and remarked, &#34;Very good choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pointed to the waiter and said, &#34;Only the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making our order, Isabella reclined in her chair and looked at me with a hint of amusement. &#34;So, will we be discussing it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; I asked, even though I already knew where this was going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips formed a knowing smile as she cocked her head. &#34;Emily. It wasn&#39;t exactly a subtle situation back in your office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head and laughed. &#34;Emily is a passionate person. She will be alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small forward lean, Isabella remarked, &#34;You keep saying that. But do you think it&#39;s true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused and swirled my glass of wine. &#34;Emily is... complicated,&#34; I said. &#34;She has trouble believing others, and she snaps when she feels threatened. It&#39;s nothing I haven&#39;t handled previously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I the danger?&#34; Isabella raised an eyebrow in answer. &#34;To you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A half smile lifted the corner of my mouth as I looked directly into her eyes. &#34;Can you blame her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled quietly, her eyes sparkling. &#34;I wasn&#39;t aware I was so dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you are,&#34; I answered in a lighthearted yet somewhat somber tone. &#34;You possess intelligence, self assurance, and, let&#39;s say it, a knack for drawing attention to yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella didn&#39;t turn away even though her cheeks slightly flushed. &#34;Ethan, you&#39;re not so bad yourself. Though I think Emily might have something to say about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I relaxed in my chair and kept my eyes fixed on hers. &#34;My actions aren&#39;t dictated by Emily&#39;s views. I make my own decisions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Obviously,&#34; she remarked, her smile getting sly. &#34;How about right now? What choice are you going to make this evening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unspoken tension hung in the air as the question was asked. I kept my eyes on her, allowing the silence to linger long enough for her to wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I muttered in a quiet voice, &#34;I think I&#39;ll let the night decide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella&#39;s witty banter and unreserved confidence were a welcoming contrast from the usual, and she had a way of keeping me on my toes. The atmosphere between us was electrifying by the time we left the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella stopped and looked at me as we stepped out into the cool night air. &#34;I think I should head home now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or you could come back to my place for a drink,&#34; I offered, taking a step closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sultry smile curled her lips as she raised an eyebrow. &#34;A drink? Is that what we&#39;re calling it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged and grinned. &#34;You can call it whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to consider it for a moment, looking into my eyes. She then nodded. &#34;All right. Just one drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The penthouse was softly lit when we arrived, the city lights flowing through the floor to ceiling windows and casting long shadows across the sleek, modern decor. Isabella wandered to the windows as I poured us each a glass of scotch, giving her one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really never do anything halfway, do you?&#34; she said, pointing to the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why settle for less?&#34; I answered, joining her by the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, the stress between us was thick enough to cut with a knife. When she finally turned to look at me, her face was unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, you&#39;re a difficult man to figure out,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; I replied, stepping forward. &#34;I like keeping people guessing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laughter was sweet and deep. &#34;What about Emily? Does she see who you really are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a twinge of guilt at Emily&#39;s mention, but I pushed it away. &#34;Emily sees what she wants to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what do you want her to see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, I closed the space between us, pressing my hand against hers. She didn&#39;t pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isabella,&#34; I said, barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at me, searching my eyes. &#34;Ethan, what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned closer and whispered, &#34;Taking a risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first kiss was timid, almost cautious, but it quickly deepened as our tension snapped like an overtaut string. She put her hands on my shoulders, drawing me in, and I wrapped my arms around her waist in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone vibrated in my pocket as we stumbled toward the couch. I was too lost in the moment to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in weeks, I let myself forget about the chaos beyond these walls as her lips pressed against mine and her breathing became hot and uneven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the phone buzzed again, more insistently this time, I didn&#39;t answer. Whatever it was could wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We fell onto the couch in a tangle of limbs and clothes, our mouths never parting. She moaned softly against my lips as my hands explored her body, feeling every curve. I kissed her deeply, hungrily, while her fingers twisted in my hair, pulling me closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking away from the kiss, I caught my breath. After a moment of eye contact, I dove back in, our lips meeting again with an intensity that revealed years of unrequited desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands slipped beneath my shirt, touching bare skin as she explored every part of me. My body responded to her touch with an urgent need for release, and I groaned at the feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled back from the kiss again, following my lips down her neck to her chest. Her nipples were hard and sensitive beneath the fabric of her shirt, and I couldn&#39;t resist taking them into my mouth, one after the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She writhed against me, her body rising into mine as her moans grew louder. I continued my exploration, hands moving down until I reached the hem of her skirt. With a flick of my wrist, it was gathered around her feet, leaving her exposed and open to my touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slipped my fingers between her thighs, seeking her warmth, and kissed them. Her hips bucked against me as her breathing came in sharp, ragged gasps, and she clutched at me for support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tongue darted out, drawing delicate patterns on the inside of her knee before moving higher. She whimpered softly and ran her fingers through my hair as I worked my way up her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When our lips finally met again, it felt like coming home. Our bodies moved together smoothly, perfectly in sync. Her hands tightened around me, drawing me deeper into the frenzied desire that devoured us both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we moved faster and harder, our moans getting louder with each passing second, I realized this was more than just sex; it was a release from everything that had been holding us back for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally cried out my name, her body shaking beneath me, and I followed, my own release sending waves of pleasure through my entire body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, we lay there, our bodies still joined like two pieces of a whole. Our breathing slowed, and for a brief moment, there was nothing but the sound of our hearts beating in perfect unison, no problems, no outside world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned down to kiss her once more, our lips barely touching, as if savoring this moment that would be forever etched in our minds. As I pulled away, I knew nothing could ever separate us again.</p>
