                <p>I hit send on the message, my hands trembling slightly as the words appeared on the screen: I can&#39;t keep this up with you. I&#39;m moving out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in the center of the apartment, staring at my phone as the message went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been considering this choice for days. I could only handle so much of Ethan&#39;s ongoing secrets and his emotional barriers. After our most recent chat, I realized that I couldn&#39;t continue to live with someone who wouldn&#39;t let me in because my dissatisfaction had been growing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even still, a tiny part of me hurt as I looked at my phone, expecting a reaction that never materialized. I had been deceiving myself into believing that he would tell me the truth if I waited long enough. But waiting wasn&#39;t working anymore. A change had to be made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later, I found myself standing in the hallway of a sleek, modern apartment building in the heart of Manhattan. The agent had just shown me the final apartment available; it was huge, quiet, and sufficiently removed from the bustle of Monroe. Large windows in the living area allow in a gentle glow of daylight. Though smaller than the penthouse, it was ideal for a fresh start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real estate agent smiled politely and continued, &#34;This is a prime unit. It&#39;s the best available on short notice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pretended to listen and nodded, but my thoughts were elsewhere. Part of me still thought about the message I sent Ethan, but I wanted to concentrate on the apartment and feel like I was taking charge of my life once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was I doing the right thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it the correct thing to leave him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she flipped through her binder, the realtor asked, &#34;Would you like to go ahead and fill out the rental forms?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe so,&#34; I responded, somewhat hesitantly. &#34;It seems... perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front door opened behind us before I could finish speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My entire body tensed. Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was hurrying inside, his face flushed with panic, when I turned around. I was caught off guard when he unexpectedly showed up during my attempt at a new beginning. The realtor hastily excused herself and left us alone after noticing the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, what are you doing here?&#34; As he came closer, I crossed my arms and asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked into my eyes and replied, a little out of breath, &#34;I got your message. You can&#39;t leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed resentfully. &#34;Can&#39;t I? Ethan, we haven&#39;t spoken for days. I have made every effort to make sense of your situation, but you have entirely cut me off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ran a hand through his hair and shook his head. &#34;That isn&#39;t the case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what is it like?&#34; Frustrated, I raised my voice and demanded. &#34;You claim to be defending me, but you won&#39;t explain what you&#39;re defending me against. I can&#39;t continue to act like everything is alright because you won&#39;t trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stepped closer and repeated, &#34;I am protecting you. Just a lot of things are happening that I can&#39;t tell you about just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms more tightly and rolled my eyes. &#34;Ethan, that&#39;s the issue. You refuse to share this with me. And I&#39;m done waiting for you to choose a time that works for me to enter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan let out a harsh sigh, clearly frustrated. &#34;I&#39;m trying to solve this, Emily. Everything&#39;s a mess right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should I do in the meantime, then?&#34; With a trembling voice, I interrupted. &#34;Just wait for you to decide when you&#39;re ready to talk, and sit around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped closer and murmured softly, &#34;I need your trust.&#34; For the first time, I could see the dread in his eyes, and his voice was suddenly begging. fear of losing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice cracked as I continued, &#34;Ethan, I want to trust you. But I have nothing to trust from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between us, there was a thick, agonizing quiet. The corners of my eyes pricked with tears, but I blinked them away. I was unable to cry. Not right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm voice, I finally stated, &#34;I&#39;m renting this apartment.  need room. I can&#39;t continue to live with you while our relationship is deteriorating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s jaw clenched and his cheeks hardened. &#34;Don&#39;t do this, Emily. Don&#39;t leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must,&#34; I muttered. &#34;I can&#39;t continue to act as though nothing is wrong. Not when you&#39;re not telling me anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not what you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then tell me what it is!&#34; I lost my temper. &#34;You refuse to tell me the truth, even though you keep insisting it&#39;s not what I believe. You won&#39;t tell me the truth, so how am I meant to stay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan paced the room while running both hands through his hair. He was struggling to say something, anything, that would keep me, and I could see that conflict in him. But he was unable to. I wasn&#39;t going to wait around for him to decide he was ready to open up, and he wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realtor, who had been quietly observing from the corner, caught my attention once more. &#34;I&#39;m ready to fill out the paperwork.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on!&#34; Ethan took hold of my arm and whirled me around. Now his eyes begged, desperate. &#34;What about the vacation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scowled. &#34;What vacation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The one I recommended,&#34; Ethan stated in a pressing tone. &#34;You mentioned that you needed some time apart from everything to get your thoughts straight. Come on. Let&#39;s take a break. Away from the pandemonium, we can solve everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed at him, taken aback by the abrupt change in his voice. The trip? He meant it. In reality, he was recommending that we take a vacation from everything-the business, the FBI, the secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan...&#34; Unsure of what to say, I began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily, please,&#34; he said, stepping closer again. &#34;Let&#39;s simply leave this place. We can work it out. I promise, once we&#39;re away, I&#39;ll explain everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Torn between wanting to believe him and the persistent sense that nothing would change, I looked into his face. However, the idea of getting away-of temporarily putting all of this behind us-was alluring. I required a respite. Both of us did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With doubt racing through my head, I said, &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan gently touched my hand as he reached for it. &#34;I know I made a mistake, Emily. I&#39;m trying to protect you, even though I know I&#39;ve concealed some things from you. Come with me, please. Let&#39;s put this all on hold for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed the vulnerability in his eyes as I peered into them. In his own way, he was attempting to make things better. And perhaps. just possibly this trip might be just what we need to resolve our differences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still hesitant, wondering if I could truly trust him in light of everything that had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally answered, &#34;I&#39;ll give it some thought,&#34; and withdrew my hand. &#34;But I&#39;m not promising anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan nodded, clearly relieved. &#34;That is all I&#39;m requesting.&#34;</p>
