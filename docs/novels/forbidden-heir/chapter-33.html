                <p>I stood at the doorway of Agent Richards&#39; office and said, &#34;Agent Richards was here again, Ethan.&#34; In the hopes that he wouldn&#39;t dismiss me this time, I stood my ground. Watching him leaf through a pile of papers as if he hadn&#39;t heard me made my heart accelerate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up after a time, his forehead furrowed in a frown. &#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the preceding document still vivid in my mind, I hesitated. &#34;He&#39;s asking questions about Monroe Enterprises again. about you as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan didn&#39;t blinked at all. &#34;Let him ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let him ask?&#34; I said it again, raising my voice. &#34;This is serious, Ethan! That document I discovered wasn&#39;t a simple error. The FBI is now breathing down our necks because you are concealing something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a groan, he leaned back in his chair and narrowed his eyes. &#34;You have no idea what you&#39;re talking about, Emily. That document is worthless. Just old paperwork from my father&#39;s deals. It won&#39;t lead to anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothin&#39;?&#34; With a swell of frustration, I entered the office. &#34;Ethan, they are illegal weapons! How can you pretend it doesn&#39;t exist as you sit there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression stiffened. &#34;I don&#39;t own it. It belonged to my dad. And nobody&#39;s going to find out about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I tightened my chest as I glared at him. &#34;How do you know for sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;Because I know how to handle it,&#34; getting out of his chair and shrinking the space with his massive frame. &#34;You need to stop worrying about things that aren&#39;t your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach turned over. &#34;Aren&#39;t my concern? Ethan, the FBI is looking into us! You&#39;re excluding me, and I&#39;m losing all sense of reality. If something goes wrong, I&#39;m also involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s eyes were steely and his mouth was clinched. &#34;It has nothing to do with you, as I already stated. I&#39;m going to handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head and muttered, &#34;Right. Like you&#39;ve been taking care of everything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer. As though our chat had come to an end, he simply turned away, his back to me. However, it wasn&#39;t. He was playing with fire, and I couldn&#39;t continue to be left in the dark like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left his office without saying anything more, my feelings a jumbled mess of hurt, uncertainty, and rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sank into my chair and tried to quiet the raging emotional tempest inside of me. Ethan was hiding something. I was aware. He was preventing me from entering, regardless of how hard I tried. I no longer knew how to bridge the emotional gap that had grown between us into an insurmountable chasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Agent Richards reappeared a few hours later, right before I was ready to end the day. He didn&#39;t come crashing in this time. As like he hadn&#39;t just threatened my entire world the last time we spoke, he was waiting for me beside the elevator, resting nonchalantly against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I got closer, he straightened up and said, &#34;Miss Clark. We need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a weary voice, I said, &#34;I&#39;ve already told you everything I know. Nothing new has happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards&#39; eyebrow went up. &#34;Are you certain of that? Because I suspect that by now you have discovered something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat skipped in my chest. &#34;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved in closer, staring into my eyes. &#34;Look, Emily. You must realize that Monroe Enterprises isn&#39;t clean, even though I know you care about Ethan. Your father...&#34; He stopped, obviously considering what he was going to say. &#34;The legacy of Henry Monroe&#39;s years of criminal activity did not end with him. We&#39;re getting closer and constructing a case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pulse accelerated as I swallowed forcefully. &#34;What am I supposed to do with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards&#39; eyes were shining as he grinned. &#34;Emily, you have access to things. Files, meetings, documents... You have the ability to assist us in eliminating Monroe Enterprises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt as though his words were pressing down on me. My thoughts were racing as I gazed at him. &#34;You want me to spy on Ethan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We want justice,&#34; Richards corrected. &#34;We wish to bring to light the unlawful actions that have been taking place right in front of you. If you like it or not, you&#39;re already involved. The question is, which side are you on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat constricted. &#34;I don&#39;t support anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no warmth in his smile. &#34;Both of us are aware that&#39;s untrue. You&#39;re on Ethan&#39;s side. But what if being on his side means sinking with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step back and shook my head. &#34;I can&#39;t help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards drew in a deep breath, his face growing grave. &#34;Consider it, Emily. We are able to keep you safe. We can prevent you from falling with him. But if you don&#39;t assist us, you&#39;ll be held accountable when everything explodes out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt cornered and turned my head away as my heart thumped in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a quiet, almost empathetic voice, he replied, &#34;I know it&#39;s a lot to think about. However, I&#39;m offering you an escape route. A way to protect yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head and swallowed. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards put his hands in his pockets and shrugged. &#34;Suit yourself. But keep in mind that you might regret you had chosen otherwise when the time comes, and it will come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and left me standing there, my head whirling, after saying that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I drove home, I spent a considerable amount of time sitting in my car absorbing Richards&#39; entire speech again. I was to assist him in dismantling Monroe Enterprises. He wanted me to betray Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In actuality, though, I wasn&#39;t sure if I could pull it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s secrecy infuriated me, but I couldn&#39;t hand him up to the FBI. I couldn&#39;t turn on him in that way. Not after all that we had endured. However, I was being crushed by the weight of his falsehoods, and I wasn&#39;t sure how much longer I could bear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan wasn&#39;t home when I arrived. The apartment had the same chilly, deserted feeling as our relationship had begun. With my head in my hands, I took a seat on the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is it possible for me to hide this from him? Should I?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found myself torn between devotion and treachery, between Ethan and the FBI. Furthermore, I wasn&#39;t sure how long I could continue doing this until anything broke.</p>
