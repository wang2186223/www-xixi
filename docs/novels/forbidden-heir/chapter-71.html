                <p>As I made my way to my car, the cool evening air did little to stop the storm building inside my chest, and the phone buzzed in my pocket. I kept thinking about Emily&#39;s choice from earlier in the day. The gravity of what I had asked her to do was too great for me to ignore. However, my mind became more focused when I looked at the screen and saw Victor&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victor,&#34; I said, maintaining a steady tone of voice in spite of the abrupt increase in tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, my boy,&#34; he said in a kind, almost paternal voice. &#34;Are you free tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused, looking out at the far-off city lights. &#34;I need to finish a few things at the office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor said smoothly, &#34;Cancel them,&#34; which was not exactly an order. &#34;Please come to my house. It&#39;s been too long since we&#39;ve had a proper conversation. A bottle of your preferred scotch is waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, already realizing that I had no real option. &#34;I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right. I&#39;ll send the address. Be careful when driving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could answer, the call ended. I tightened my jaw, got into the car, and drove out of the lot. With each mile, my shoulders became more tense. Victor rarely called me without a purpose, and his tone tonight had been deceptively light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In sharp contrast to the bustle of the city, the mansion was nestled on a vast estate. As I got closer, the gates opened, and a security officer gave me a nod before letting me pass. The driveway meandered past sculptures illuminated by gentle, golden lights and immaculately mowed lawns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was met at the door by a butler who took me down a hallway lined with artwork that was likely more expensive than my penthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler indicated a pair of double doors and said, &#34;Victor is waiting in the study.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The enormous study was filled with book and artifact shelves. Victor stood by the fireplace with a glass of amber liquid in his hand, dressed in a well-tailored suit as though he were getting ready for a big event&#39;s gala. When I walked in, he turned, a warm smile spreading across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked across the room and said, &#34;Ethan. It&#39;s good to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook Victor&#39;s hand and said, &#34;You too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pointed to a leather armchair and said, &#34;Sit. Relax. You&#39;ve been working too hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He insisted that I relax, but I sat down with my back straight. He sat across from me, his eyes piercing even in the dim light, and handed me a glass of scotch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swirling his drink, he noted, &#34;You&#39;re quiet tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I acknowledged, &#34;I wasn&#39;t anticipating a social call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor gave a deep, almost reassuring laugh. &#34;You know, it&#39;s not all about business. You should know that by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a nod but remained silent. With Victor, it was safer to keep quiet because it revealed nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darted to the fireplace as he leaned back. &#34;You know, you make me think of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t have to ask who he was referring to. &#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;Of course you don&#39;t know,&#34; with a hint of laughter. It was a dry laugh, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he went on, &#34;My son. He was your age mates. One could argue that Henry was a father figure to him as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had a son?&#34; I said, almost in a whisper, shocked to hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s face softened as he nodded. &#34;He was strong, intelligent, determined-just like you. Losing him&#34; He took a slow sip of his drink and trailed off. &#34;It created a gap. One that&#39;s hard to fill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pressure of his words caused me to shift in my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went on, in a kind but determined tone, &#34;You&#39;ve done more than I ever expected. Henry might not have seen it, but you&#39;ve got a strength that most men can only dream of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subliminal reminder that I owed him and that he valued me when others did not was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carefully said, &#34;I&#39;m just trying to keep everything together,&#34; as I watched his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned and remarked, &#34;And you&#39;re doing an excellent job so far, Ethan.&#34; However, resist the urge to give in to the pressure. Balance is what I wanted to discuss tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arched an eyebrow. &#34;Balance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, life is more than just work. You&#39;ve been running yourself ragged, handling everything alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a clipped voice, I answered, &#34;I&#39;m used to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor looked at me for a while, his face unreadable. &#34;You&#39;re not required to be. Was it difficult, for example, when you called me to get Richards off your back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He interrupted me before I could reply, saying, &#34;I am not your enemy, Ethan; we are, I suppose, family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was surprised by how earnest his tone was. The warmth in his eyes seemed genuine for a moment, as if he truly cared. However, I was aware. There was always a reason, a purpose, with Victor. And I was aware that he was getting ready to ask for a favor in return, which I would be unable to refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a specific topic here?&#34; I inquired, returning the discussion to a topic I knew well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor put down his glass and laughed again. &#34;Ethan, not everything is a transaction. To remind you that you are more than the sum of your obligations and transactions, I brought you here. You are significant to me and the family we have created.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Family. The word made my chest twist. Victor used it like a weapon, knowing exactly where to aim it, but I wasn&#39;t sure I still believed in the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;Thanks,&#34; in a neutral tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied, he nodded. &#34;Now, finish your drink. I&#39;ll have the chef prepare something for you before you leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation shifted to lighter subjects as I stayed for an additional thirty minutes. Victor talked about his planned trip, the market, and art. But beneath it all, I could feel the unspoken expectations hanging in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My shoulders felt heavy by the time I left, even though the scotch was warming my chest. Despite Victor&#39;s claim that it wasn&#39;t about business, it always was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept thinking about what he had said as I drove back into the city. You are significant to me and our family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my hold on the steering wheel. Family. Despite Victor&#39;s best efforts to persuade me otherwise, I wasn&#39;t sure I could ever claim that word.</p>
