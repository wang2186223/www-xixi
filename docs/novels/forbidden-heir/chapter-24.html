                <p>&#34;Emily, are you even listening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts were interrupted by Sophie&#39;s words, but I hardly paid attention. I noticed the worried expression on her face as I looked at her across the table. We were seated in the little café next to my apartment in the late afternoon. This would normally be a nice reunion of old friends, but today everything felt different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I murmured, looking down at my phone once more. &#34;Yeah, sorry.&#34; The pile of choices and power struggles I had been handling at Monroe Enterprises had kept my head racing all day. The simplicity of my former life had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie sighed, obviously annoyed. &#34;Since I arrived, you have been behaving strangely. You&#39;re hardly listening at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an attempt to relieve the strain in my shoulders, I forced a smile. &#34;I&#39;m simply... busy. This week has been quite hectic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A hectic week?&#34; Sophie reiterated in a doubtful tone. &#34;You&#39;ve changed, Emily. I hardly recognize you anymore. This isn&#39;t you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her remarks made me angry, and I felt a jolt of annoyance seep into my chest. She didn&#39;t understand. Sophie was a small-town girl, rooted in a world that no longer existed for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People change, Soph,&#34; I remarked, sounding more abrasive than I meant to. &#34;I&#39;m not the same person I was back in Willow Creek. This is my life now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why does that mean you have to become... like this?&#34; Sophie leaned forward to inquire. &#34;Whatever happened to the people-loving Emily? Who wasn&#39;t obsessed with money and power?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exclaimed, &#34;I&#39;m not fixated on cash and power,&#34; before I could stop myself. &#34;I&#39;m doing my obligations. This business is brutal. I&#39;ll be eaten alive if I don&#39;t change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Sophie&#39;s eyes softened, the worry persisted. &#34;I&#39;m concerned for you. This isn&#39;t who you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up from the table and scoffed. &#34;Perhaps you no longer recognize me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we made our way back to my apartment, the awkwardness between us persisted. Since our quarrel, Sophie had hardly talked, and I wasn&#39;t sure if I should try to make amends or simply let her go. In actuality, she was correct. I was different. But I didn&#39;t have a choice. Joining Monroe Enterprises required me to play a new game, one that I had to win at all costs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived at my flat, I paused at the entrance and looked around for my keys. Sophie was standing next to me with her arms folded and her face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She muttered, &#34;I&#39;m going back to Willow Creek tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her and froze. &#34;Already? I assumed you would be here for a few more days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie shook her head. &#34;I&#39;m not sure if I can be with you at this time. Not in this manner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t show it, but her remarks struck me more strongly than I had anticipated. I had learned how to hide my emotions in this world, how to keep people at arm&#39;s length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right,&#34; I responded in a non challant tone. &#34;Do as you please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie&#39;s expression was a mix of surprise and hurt as she looked at me for a while. Then she turned and left without saying anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest constricted as I watched her leave, the gap between us widening. I wanted to run after her and apologize, but I refrained from doing so. Rather, I turned and opened the door, entering the vacant apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Sophie had finally left later that night, I sat in my living room and looked out the window at the city skyline. The apartment felt empty, and I considered the possibility that Sophie was right. Maybe I was changing. Maybe I was changing into a different person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That concern, however, vanished when I looked at my phone and saw the messages from Jack and Ethan regarding tomorrow&#39;s board meeting. I didn&#39;t have time to think about my past self. This was my life now, and I had to survive it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up and moved toward the window. I pondered what my future might hold in this world of riches, crime, and power as the city lights flickered in the distance. I was ready to look aside when my attention was drawn to something odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squinted at a shadowy figure across the street as I froze. There it stood, the figure observing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver went through my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurried away from the window. It might have been nothing. Maybe I was just paranoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my senses sharpened, I inspected the apartment. That&#39;s when I saw it-the tiny, hardly perceptible gadget tucked away in my living room corner. a wire-tap. As I looked at it, my blood froze. I was being watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The FBI had to be involved. or worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made my skin crawl to realize that whoever it was was watching me. I couldn&#39;t remain here in this state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up my phone and called Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily?&#34; He spoke tensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shuddering voice, I said, &#34;I want to talk with you. Someone&#39;s been watching me. My apartment is bugged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a long moment. &#34;Where are you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling vulnerable, I looked around the room and muttered, &#34;At home. I can&#39;t stay here, though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With firmness, Ethan responded, &#34;I&#39;ll come get you. Pack your things. You&#39;re staying with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later, Ethan arrived. With shaking hands, I packed a few clothing and necessities into a bag and rushed out of the apartment. I felt ill because I thought someone was watching me and hearing everything I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we walked away, Ethan remained silent, but I could see the stress on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated when we got to his penthouse. Moving in with Ethan? This wasn&#39;t part of the plan. But I had no other option at the moment. Staying here with him or continuing to be a target in my own house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whispered, &#34;Thanks,&#34; as we entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mention it,&#34; Ethan replied, his voice softer than usual. &#34;This is a safe place for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Safe. All I wanted was that. Safety. However, when I turned to face Ethan, I became aware of something else: sharing this space with him seemed like something more. Something deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And perhaps, just possibly, that posed a greater threat to me than anything else.</p>
