                <p>The ballroom had emptied out, but Victor showed no indication of leaving. Instead, he indicated for me to follow him out through a side door that led down a dimly lighted hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34; I asked, a peculiar feeling sinking in my gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor smirked, gazing over his shoulder. &#34;To another part of your education, Ethan. You&#39;ll need to see every facet of this business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We descended a tiny stairs that went into a basement. When Victor unlocked the final door, a flood of heat and noise hit me-pounding music, dark lighting, and shadows moving in the blur. The room was full, people swaying in clumps or leaning against walls, drinks in hand. Red and blue lights flashed overhead, adding a bizarre, chaotic glow to the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor took me deeper in, threading through the mob. My heart raced as I took in the scene-people scarcely dressed, some engaged in acts that made me look away. A woman in a gold outfit with a glass of something hot red stepped up to Victor, connecting her arm with his. She flashed an inquisitive glance my way and smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is Henry&#39;s son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor gave her a casual nod. &#34;Indeed. He&#39;s learning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman turned her attention to me, a glint of interest in her eyes. &#34;Lucky you,&#34; she purred, reaching out to trail a finger down my arm. I faked a tight smile, willing myself to stay composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor leaned closer. &#34;Relax, Ethan. Tonight is just about unwinding. Enjoy yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer. The lights flashed across Victor&#39;s face, exposing a delighted smirk as he watched me try to preserve my calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reached a set of velvet-covered couches. Victor sat down, patting the area near him. I hesitated but ultimately dropped myself into the seat, my gaze traveling about the room. In the corner, a DJ blasted music so loud it felt like it was smashing through my chest. Naked dancers walked through the gathering, occasionally stopping to join guests on the couches, leaning near, laughing, whispering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them, a woman with black hair and smokey eyes, sauntered over to us. She placed herself between Victor and me, giving me a mocking smile. &#34;First time here?&#34; she asked, her voice a sultry purr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I managed, feeling the words get lodged in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor laughed, leaning back as he watched her run her fingers through my hair. &#34;Go on, Ethan. She doesn&#39;t bite unless you want her to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dancer chuckled, her fingertips running down my chest. I forced myself to sit still, suppressing the instinct to shove her away. This was all part of the game, a test, another chance for Victor to determine if I could manage his reality. But as the minutes went, the place began to seem claustrophobic, the stench of booze, sweat, and smoke clogging my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pulse raced as I felt her warm, smooth skin crush against me. I attempted to maintain eye contact with her but couldn&#39;t stop staring down at her perky breasts bouncing in front of my face. She leaned in closer and murmured in my ear, &#34;I&#39;m going to make you feel so good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the music changed tempo, she began teasing me by sliding her hands through her hair and across her body, occasionally brushing against my erection. I couldn&#39;t believe how turned on by a stripper I was; it felt like every nerve ending in my body was on fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued grinding into me, moving faster and more fiercely with each passing instant. Her hands moved down my chest and stomach till they reached the zipper of my jeans. With one rapid action, she unzipped them and pulled out my massive erection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped as she closed her lips around the head of my cock, sucking lightly at first before bringing it deeper into her mouth. I moaned loudly, unable to contain myself any longer. She continued sucking me off while simultaneously rubbing against his lap, generating a perfect storm of ecstasy that threatened to consume me utterly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the song reached its climax, so did I. With one more push, I exploded, cumming all over her face and chest. The awareness of what had just transpired washed over me like a tidal wave of embarrassment and shame. I quickly zipped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Victor bent down laughing hysterically, his countenance delighted. &#34;You don&#39;t look like you&#39;re having much fun, Ethan. Maybe you need another drink?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, felt the bile rise in my throat. &#34;I I think I&#39;ve had enough for one night.&#34; pushing her aside while she laughed at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s smile wavered, but he kept his tone light. &#34;A shame. But perhaps you&#39;re just not used to the excitement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dancer gave me a disappointed pout before drifting off, and I sighed, the tension relaxing just a bit. Victor flashed me a look, one that felt like a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the life you&#39;re stepping into, Ethan,&#34; he added, his tone lowering to a near-whisper. &#34;If you&#39;re not up to it, there are plenty of others who would be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met his eyes, swallowing hard. &#34;I&#39;m here, aren&#39;t I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered a slow nod, apparently content. &#34;Then go on, enjoy yourself. I&#39;ll call it a night soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t remain. The room felt like it was closing in on me, the noise, the lights, the people all merging together into a nauseous jumble. I murmured a hasty excuse and rushed for the exit, pushing my way through the crowd and up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I reached the street, the chilly night air felt like a relief. I stumbled to a waiting cab, my head aching from the noise and the drink Victor had been pouring my way. The ride back to my apartment passed in a whirlwind, the city lights streaking by as I laid my head against the window, my stomach still knotted in knots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I eventually reached my apartment, I fumbled with the key and pulled the door open, barely making it to the couch before falling. The calm was overwhelming after the pandemonium of that place, but the memories stayed, refusing to leave my memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay there, the room whirling around me, until the sound of the door opening made me sit up, squinting in the faint light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked, attempting to focus on the man approaching. It was Ben, relief blazing across his face as he crossed the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ben what are you doing here?&#34; I managed, my voice mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben sighed, crossing his arms as he glanced me over. &#34;I&#39;ve been calling you all night. You had me worried, man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brushed a palm over my face, feeling the weight of the night sink over me. &#34;I was out. Victor had some kind of party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s expression clouded. &#34;You went with Victor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, unable to find the words to explain. The memory of the club, the people, the looks they&#39;d given me-they were all etched in my mind, replaying over and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s stare softened slightly. &#34;Ethan, you don&#39;t have to do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked aside, the words sticking in my throat. &#34;I don&#39;t have a choice, Ben.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben shook his head, his voice full with frustration. &#34;Maybe you do, but you&#39;re too stubborn to see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back, closed my eyes. &#34;I just I just need some rest. Can we talk about this later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben sighed, his shoulders dropping. &#34;Fine. But you need to be careful, Ethan. Victor&#39;s not just throwing party for nothing. And if you&#39;re not careful, you&#39;ll end up just like-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t finish the phrase, but I knew precisely what he was going to say. Just like my father.</p>
