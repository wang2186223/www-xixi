                <p>Ethan. A firearm. The man falling to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could still hear the gunshot&#39;s piercing crack, which seemed to bounce through my bones. Ethan turned to see me stuck in place, scarcely breathing, unable to move. I couldn&#39;t get the sight in his eyes out of my head; it was a mix of surprise, sorrow, and something else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t waited for his answer. I ran with my heart beating so hard it felt like it might burst out of my chest after my legs finally followed my brain. I kept going till I got to my car, struggling with the keys while my eyes went dark from crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned on the steering wheel, fighting to breathe, and locked the doors after entering. In the back seat, my phone kept buzzing. Ethan&#39;s name constantly displayed on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was unable to answer myself. What could I possibly say? What on earth could he say to me? That it wasn&#39;t as it appeared? That he was powerless? I was convinced otherwise by the picture of his calm hand pulling the trigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buzzing had stopped by the time I turned into my apartment building&#39;s driveway, but my phone was still showing a number of unread texts and almost a dozen missed calls. None of them were opened by me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather, I staggered inside and locked the door. My apartment was oppressively silent, the quiet intensifying the mental storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breathing was weak as I sat on the edge of the couch and stared at nothing. I stayed there for hours, too restless to sleep, too numb to cry. Although Ethan hadn&#39;t said a word at the scene, his voice and face still echoed in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaustion finally set in when the gray light of morning crept through the blinds at the crack of dawn. However, I pulled myself to the shower rather than dozing off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was driving to the workplace, Ethan&#39;s calls continued, but I let them to ring. With each call that went unanswered, my resolve got stronger. He owed me answers, and this time I wasn&#39;t going to let him get away with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, with the burden of the night before still weighing heavily on my chest, I entered an office that felt colder than usual. Slower than the last, my footsteps reverberated down the empty hallway to Ethan&#39;s office. How could I have slept? With the piercing sound of the gunshot still echoing in my ears, I watched Gerard&#39;s lifeless body hit the ground each time I closed my eyes. And Ethan pulling the trigger, cool, calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered his face when he spotted me, and the pain in my throat got more intense. Startle. I&#39;m sorry. And another thing. Was it terror?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite my phone going nonstop throughout the night, I hadn&#39;t returned his calls. I couldn&#39;t stand to hear his voice, yet his name kept coming up on my screen. Not until I had answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped in front of the heavy wood door of his office. Without knocking, I pulled it open while taking a steadying breath. With his tie loose over his neck and bloodshot eyes, Ethan looked up from his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily,&#34; he continued in a low, almost begging voice. &#34;You didn&#39;t answer my calls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;I had nothing to say,&#34; and closed the door. I tightened my hands into fists as they shook. &#34;But now, I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan got up and walked toward me around the desk. &#34;Listen, I can explain-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I didn&#39;t care if my voice sounded harsher than I had meant. &#34;Ethan, you have no right to deny what I saw last night. You killed him. You ruthlessly murdered a man!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He winced but did not flee. &#34;Cold blood wasn&#39;t involved. It was necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Necessary?&#34; I crossed my arms and laughed bitterly. &#34;Is that what you plan to use? How could someone&#39;s life be justified in that way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s jaw tensed as he paused. &#34;He posed a risk to us both. To all that we are trying to protect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped forward, my voice shaking with rage. &#34;Protect? You dare not act as though this was about me. You killed Gerard for your own gain, not for us. Admit it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes wavered, and I briefly believed he might. However, he straightened and put his mask back on. &#34;Emily, you don&#39;t understand the circumstances. Gerard left me with nothing to do as Victor breathed on my neck. The problem would have become worse if I hadn&#39;t taken action.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Worse than murder?&#34; My nails dug into my hands as I spat. &#34;Can you hear yourself at all? Ethan, you&#39;re exactly like him. identical to Victor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t,&#34; he said sharply, his tone tightening. &#34;Stop comparing me with him. Instead of making this problem worse, I&#39;m working to mend it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fix it?&#34; My voice broke. &#34;Everything is being ruined by you, even yourself. You are also pulling me along with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s face was impenetrable as he gazed at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he stated in a calmer tone, &#34;I&#39;m doing this to protect you. You have to believe that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step back and shook my head. &#34;Ethan, I no longer believe a word you say. Not after what I saw. You can&#39;t go back from the line you crossed last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand moved at his side as though he considered reaching for me but decided against it. &#34;Emily, please-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Despite the pain in my chest from trying to keep from breaking, I spoke strongly. &#34;I can no longer do this. Knowing what you&#39;re capable of, I can&#39;t work with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you saying?&#34; A glimmer of fear pierced his calm, and his eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m saying I&#39;m done,&#34; I whispered, turning to face the door. &#34;I&#39;m resigning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze when I heard Ethan&#39;s words. &#34;You don&#39;t mean that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around and looked him in the eye. &#34;Watch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked really shaken for the first time. &#34;Emily, if you leave now-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hard voice, I interrupted, &#34;I&#39;m not leaving right now. But I will. I&#39;ll be going by the end of the week after writing my letter of resignation today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his hand out, he stepped in my way. &#34;Don&#39;t do this, Emily. Together, we can solve this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt nothing but a hollow sadness as I looked at him, the man I had once believed I could trust. &#34;No, Ethan. You set the answer. I&#39;m tired of becoming a casualty in your fight with Victor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart pounding in my chest, I left before he could speak another thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my laptop back at my desk, the screen&#39;s glare stinging my eyes. I was nervous as my fingers lingered over the keyboard. It felt like I was cutting the final link between Ethan and everything I had built here when I wrote my resignation. However, staying would mean sacrificing what I believed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind was racing with bits and pieces of our fight as I started typing. His reasons. He begged. He seemed to be unable to handle losing me based on the way he looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I detested the fact that I was still affected by that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears entered my eyes and clouded the words on the screen, but I blinked them away. Weakness was not appropriate at this time. Now I had to defend myself, even if it meant forever leaving Ethan behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until his voice broke the silence that I heard him coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, I raised my head. With an enigmatic look, Ethan stood in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands were clenched at his sides as he said, &#34;You can&#39;t do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already have,&#34; I said, firmly shutting my laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step toward me and looked into my eyes. &#34;I need you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied, &#34;No, Ethan,&#34; with a little break in my voice. &#34;You don&#39;t need me. You need someone who will ignore you as you ruin everything in your way. And I&#39;m not like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly feared that he would dispute, but all he did was nod, his expression a mask of resignation. &#34;If that&#39;s what you really want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is,&#34; I pretended as I got up to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt his eyes pressing down on my back as I passed him, but I decided not to turn around. I doubted I&#39;d have the strength to leave if I did.</p>
