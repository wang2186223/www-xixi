                <p>The door to Jack&#39;s office slammed behind me, but his words echoed in my mind: &#34;She&#39;ll be here tomorrow.&#34;  This woman, who was she? How could she be related to my father? With a rising blood pressure, I stormed out of the building, my frustration not abating despite the evening breeze. Even though it was 7 p.m., the normal frantic energy of New York City was visible. Ignorant of the chaos brewing inside of me, everyone went about their daily business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack had taken me by surprise. He had written a letter to a person I had never heard of, who was mentioned in my father&#39;s will, behind my back. I had no idea who this woman was, and now she was coming tomorrow. I could feel my power slipping away. My father had a hidden existence, and Jack always seemed to be ahead of me, knowing more and playing the strings while I was left to pick up the pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea made my hands ball into fists. I needed time to myself, space to contemplate. I immediately grabbed a ride and made my way to The Sterling Room, one of my exclusive lounges that is only open to members. My father had often visited this location as a means of escaping the stresses of the outside world. It was my turn to use it for mental clarity now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shoved my way inside the classy, understated structure as soon as the car pulled up. The Sterling Room included marble tables and comfortable leather chairs in a softly lighted, silent space. The subtle aroma of pricey whiskey and cigars lingered in the air, but it didn&#39;t soothe me the way it normally did tonight. I made straight for my favorite position near the rear, a secluded corner overlooking the city where I could see the lights of New York glittering in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without asking, the hostess gave me a glass of single malt Scotch. Even though it was one of my best bottles-old and silky-it tasted acrid tonight. While I sat there, I tried to clear my head by swirling the drink. But despite my best efforts, I was unable to get Jack off my mind. Why hadn&#39;t he told me about this? And why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a buzz on my phone. Ben&#39;s name appeared on the screen in a flash. I sat back in the chair and stared at the skyline, ignoring it. Ben would eventually locate me. He did all the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentle click of footsteps announced his presence fifteen minutes later. Ben murmured, &#34;There you are,&#34; as he slid into the chair across from me and looked over my face. &#34;Thought you would be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arched an eyebrow. &#34;What other place would I be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben gave the hostess a sly smile and motioned for a drink. &#34;Man, I&#39;m not sure. Given your recent attitude, I kind of thought you might vanish onto a private island.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled bitterly. &#34;Not a terrible idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His drink was here, a neat vintage bourbon. Glancing at me over the rim of his glass, he took a sip. &#34;So, what&#39;s causing you to feel like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben quietly said, &#34;Of course,&#34; and leaned back in his chair. &#34;Now what has he done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He went behind me. wrote a letter to a woman whose name appeared in my father&#39;s will. He didn&#39;t tell me about her until today, and I had no idea that she even existed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben arched an eyebrow, obviously curious. &#34;A woman who is mysterious? This is simply getting better and better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a quick glance. &#34;This is not fucking funny man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben held up his palms in a sarcastic defense. &#34;All right, all right. But really, what&#39;s going on? How come he didn&#39;t inform you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hand running through my hair, I could feel the frustration simmering beneath the surface. &#34;The problem is that he consistently withholds information from me. He claims that it&#39;s because my father left detailed instructions, yet this is the legacy of my family. I ought to be fully informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben looked at me for a minute. &#34;Do you believe Jack is hiding something more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure.&#34; Gazing at the lights in the exquisite lounge, I let out a sigh. &#34;However, it seems like he&#39;s hiding more than what&#39;s going on. This is the second incident after the offshore accounts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben took a second sip of his drink. &#34;You don&#39;t trust him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I delayed responding for a while. With Jack, trust was an intricate matter. He had been the loyal family lawyer for years, faithful to my father. But I was uncomfortable with the way he handled things; he was always one step ahead of me and kept me slightly in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I uttered softly, &#34;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t trust him.&#34; The reason is that I dislike being in the dark. I have to know what&#39;s going on, and Jack usually leaves me out of the crucial information.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben crossed his legs and relaxed further in the cozy chair. &#34;Look, Jack is most likely simply carrying out your father&#39;s wishes. I thought Henry was all about control? even from death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s true,&#34; I whispered. &#34;However, I&#39;m sick of waiting for Jack to decide when I get the answers because I need them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, Ben tapped the rim of his drink. &#34;So, in your opinion, what should I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer straight away since I was still a little angry. &#34;I&#39;d like to know this woman&#39;s identity. Why my father bequeathed her something. And why in the world did Jack wait until now to inform me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben shook his head and laughed. &#34;Your father was more secretive than the CIA, man. This could simply be just the beginning. I wouldn&#39;t be shocked if more things unfold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, well, I&#39;m over finding new ones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hours passed quickly with our drinks and chat, but the annoyance remained. The questions kept getting to me, no matter how hard I tried to relax. This woman, who was she? What was it that my father had left her? And why had Jack kept it so close to the vest?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed right as I was ready to place another drink order. The name of Jack flickered on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was unsure about answering at first. But when I finally answered he could hear the rudeness in my voice &#34;What&#39;s it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk,&#34; Although Jack&#39;s voice sounded calm, it had a hint of sharpness. &#34;The Sterling Room right, I&#39;ll be there in a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying anything, I leaned back in my chair and hung up. Ben arched an eyebrow, but before I could clarify, Jack, appearing as composed and calm as ever, arrived at the lounge&#39;s entrance. I was irritated even more by his immaculately made suit not a wrinkle in sight. How on earth could he be so composed when I felt like everything was falling apart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack walked up and gave Ben a brief nod before taking a seat across from me. He didn&#39;t waste time or place a drink order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared straight ahead while lightly tapping his fingers. &#34;I Know you are upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Upset?&#34; I laughed bitterly and echoed. &#34;That is putting it mildly. Jack, you went behind my back. You withheld information from me on the letter, the woman, and other matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack tensed his jaw, yet he took a moment to answer. As though to validate what he was going to say next, he took out his phone instead. &#34;I needed to make sure everything was in place, so I didn&#39;t tell you. Your father left behind a complex will with precise instructions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot back, &#34;I don&#39;t care about instructions. I want to know what&#39;s happening. Jack, you work for me. Not the other way around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack turned to face me, his expression frigid but measured. &#34;Ethan, I work for your family. And for now, whether you agree with it or not, that means carrying out your father&#39;s final instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to disagree, but Jack interrupted me with a hand gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; he added, his tone becoming softer. &#34;This is difficult, I know. However, your father did everything for a reason. And I have been abiding according to his recommendations. It wasn&#39;t time yet, so I didn&#39;t tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, now is the right time,&#34; I clinched my teeth and uttered. &#34;Who is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack looked at his phone once more before turning to face me. &#34;Just get ready to meet her. She will be at the office tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed at him, feeling as though his words had struck me squarely in the abdomen. &#34;Tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Jack replied in a serious tone. &#34;She has already agreed to see me. All you have to do is get ready.&#34;</p>
