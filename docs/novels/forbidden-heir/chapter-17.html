                <p>&#34;Welcome again to New York, Miss Clark,&#34; Jack said, smiling courteously at me as the car arrived at a huge glass structure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was back at the office again in just a number of days</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily!&#34; There was a slight sense of comfort when Ben&#39;s voice shouted out. With his hands carelessly tucked into his pockets, he approached me with that effortless smile he always wore. &#34;You made it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to smile as I answered, &#34;Yeah,&#34; but I was still feeling overpowered by everything. &#34;I&#39;m here. Again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben laughed and pointed about. &#34;You seem to be in the major leagues now, don&#39;t you? You&#39;ll get the hang of it, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll show you how to navigate this crowd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mumbled, &#34;Thanks,&#34; appreciating his easygoing demeanor. The only thing that kept me from feeling like I was drowning in this weird new world was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack cleared his throat. &#34;We must give a formal introduction. The board has been waiting to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The board?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben gave me a quick pat on the back. &#34;Just a group of elderly men dressed in suits. There is nothing to be concerned about. I&#39;ll be there to keep you company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled slightly at him, but I was already feeling anxious. This was not what I was expecting. I wasn&#39;t prepared to explain why I, a small-town schoolteacher, had become a part of their world in front of these folks, who had most likely known Henry Monroe for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked anxiously around at the well-dressed men and ladies seated around me as I sat at the long table. Their eyes were on me, assessing, judging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing at the head of the table, Jack spoke in a polished and easygoing manner. &#34;&#34;As you all know, this is Emily Clark, Henry&#39;s daughter and a new significant shareholder in Monroe Enterprises. She will be joining us going forward, and we expect you to show her the same respect as any other member of this board.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to look them in the eyes with an awkward smile, but most of them just gave me curt nods. They didn&#39;t appear excited. Ben leaned over to whisper in my ear, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re always like this. They don&#39;t warm up easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silver-haired and stern-looking, one of the board members cleared his throat. &#34;Miss Clark, we&#39;ve all been following the recent media coverage. You&#39;ve come into quite the spotlight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben skillfully cut me off as I opened my mouth. &#34;She&#39;ll manage it perfectly. Emily&#39;s stronger than she looks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a thank-you look. Ben appeared to know just when to intervene and when to maintain a lighthearted tone. I would have broken beneath the pressure of their glances without him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the meeting progressed, topics including the company&#39;s strategies and future were discussed. I pretended to keep up while nodding along, not really understanding most of it. I was mentally worn out when it was all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I returned to the apartment that had been set up for me, I slumped down on the couch and looked up at the ceiling. It wasn&#39;t home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an attempt to ground myself, I reached for my phone and dialed my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily?&#34; I felt a little better just listening to Margo&#39;s voice over the line. &#34;Hey honey, how are you? Have you settled in well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed and said, &#34;I&#39;m here. But, Mom, it&#39;s all... it&#39;s too much. I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;m meant to fit in here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margo stopped, then said again, her voice lower. &#34;Emily, you need to be careful. You become a target when you are associated with the Monroe name. You&#39;re in a world where people will use you, where they&#39;ll want things from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned and tightened my hold on the phone. &#34;You think I&#39;m in danger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure,&#34; she said. &#34;Don&#39;t let them manipulate you; you must have faith in yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the pressure of everything, I said, &#34;I&#39;ll try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margo responded, &#34;Good,&#34; in a firm voice. &#34;Just watch out, Emily. You have a lot on your plate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We spoke for a few more minutes before hanging up, leaving me feeling more torn than ever as I stared at my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so desperate to hear Sophie&#39;s voice that I called her later that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said, &#34;Hey, city girl,&#34; trying to sound upbeat but obviously worried. &#34;How are things going? How is New York treating you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rubbed my forehead and moaned. &#34;Sophie, it&#39;s... difficult. Here, everything is different. I&#39;m not sure if I belong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie told me, &#34;You&#39;ll find your way. The speed at which things are going bothers me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t either,&#34; I said. &#34;But it&#39;s not like I can go back now. It&#39;s too late for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie paused. &#34;I simply don&#39;t want to lose you in the midst of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t,&#34; I said. &#34;I remain who I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, I had doubts about it being true even while I was saying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day went by quickly, I was out again and I mostly avoided the media craze while attempting to orient myself in this unfamiliar environment. I was worn out by the evening and ready to go to bed. My phone buzzed again after I finished eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security firm had sent out the following message: A break-in occurred. We&#39;ve secured the building, but nothing was stolen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart fell. Panic swept through me as I sat up and stared at the message. A break-in? I hadn&#39;t even been here for a full day, and already someone had gotten inside?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I promptly contacted the security firm to inquire more, but they were only able to assure me that nothing seemed amiss and that there were no indications of forced entry. I was still frightened by the thought that someone had been in the flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I called Ethan&#39;s phone, my hands were shaking. He picked up on the second ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blurted, &#34;My apartment was broken into, Ethan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a long moment before continuing. &#34;When?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced the room and said, &#34;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m afraid, even though security claimed nothing was taken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan spoke in a tone that was almost too calm. &#34;It&#39;s probably nothing. New York has its risks. Break-ins happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped pacing. &#34;You seem completely unconcerned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a firm tone, Ethan stated, &#34;There&#39;s no need to panic. I&#39;ll take care of it. You&#39;re safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know for sure?&#34; Frustration brewing inside me, I pressed. &#34;You act as though this is normal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe me,&#34; Ethan stated firmly. &#34;You&#39;re all right. There&#39;s more going on, but I&#39;ll explain when the time is right. Just keep your attention on getting settled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; I remarked quietly, &#34;you&#39;re hiding something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a while to reply, and when he did, his tone was abrupt. &#34;Emily, it&#39;s complicated. Let me take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He abruptly cut off, leaving me much more confused and wary than before. What was happening? Why wasn&#39;t Ethan more concerned?</p>
