                <p>&#34;You&#39;re up early,&#34; I said, watching Ethan move through the kitchen as though his mind was elsewhere. He moved quickly and distractedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After giving me a quick look, he returned to preparing his coffee. &#34;I couldn&#39;t sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the stress radiating from him, I moved closer. For days now, really longer, this had been going on. He no longer gave me much attention, and when he did, there was a guarded expression in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to sound impartial as I spoke, saying, &#34;You&#39;ve been... distant. And I&#39;m not referring to work here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan hesitated, his hand on the counter&#39;s edge. &#34;Emily, I simply have a lot on my mind. The FBI, business, everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to let him get away with this again, I folded my arms. &#34;That isn&#39;t it. You&#39;ve been acting strange ever since that day. You seem to be waiting for something to happen because you are always observing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he did look at me, it was difficult to read his face. &#34;I only want to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arched an eyebrow. &#34;From what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words died on his lips as he opened and closed his mouth. &#34;Emily, there are things you don&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped closer and pressed, &#34;Then help me understand. Speak to me. I&#39;m getting weary of being in the dark since you&#39;ve been excluding me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s face was marked with fury as he ran a hand through his hair. &#34;I can&#39;t... This company moves at a brutal pace that you can&#39;t possibly understand right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It stung that we were farther apart than before. I merely nodded, swallowing the rage that was about to explode since I had run out of things to say. &#34;All right. But whatever it is that you are withholding from me, Ethan, will eventually come to light.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if he didn&#39;t answer, the silence was sufficient. We were being torn apart by something significant that he was not telling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension between us has not decreased at the office. Every look, every conversation felt tense. I was aware that he was attempting to shield me, but from what? And why was he unable to tell me directly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack entered my office as I was going through a pile of reports, and as he shut the door behind him, his piercing eyes swept over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat down across from my desk and said, &#34;Emily. We must speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned and put the papers down. &#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack folded his hands on his lap and leaned forward. &#34;Recently, I&#39;ve noticed some inconsistencies between you and Ethan. The way you interact, the way he&#39;s been hovering around you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite my racing heart, I maintained a bland demeanor. &#34;Jack, we are working together closely. Nothing about that is out of the ordinary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a suspicious tone, he questioned, &#34;Is that all it is? Because Ethan has been acting erratic. More erratic than usual. I&#39;m also concerned about the FBI&#39;s current situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertain of how much to divulge, I hesitated. &#34;Ethan is simply under stress. The investigation is getting to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s eyes were sharp as he nodded slowly. &#34;How are you doing, too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question caught me off guard, and I blinked. &#34;I&#39;m all right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack didn&#39;t seem persuaded. &#34;Emily, I know you&#39;re involved in more than just business here. I&#39;ve seen the way you two are with each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart began to race. &#34;Jack, I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He interrupted by raising a hand and said, &#34;I&#39;m not accusing you of anything. Yet I&#39;m worried. Lately, Ethan&#39;s actions have been... disturbing. He&#39;s keeping things from you, isn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack wasn&#39;t incorrect, despite my best efforts to deny it. Ethan had been aloof and evasive, and I shared Jack&#39;s confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said in a low voice, &#34;I have no idea what&#39;s going on. He refuses to speak to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack leaned back in his chair and moaned. &#34;That&#39;s what I was afraid of. Emily, you need to be careful. Ethan is involved in something risky. You&#39;re being drawn into something that might end up destroying you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite my nausea, I made myself remain composed. &#34;Jack, I can manage it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe,&#34; he muttered. &#34;But can you handle him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His comments lingered in the atmosphere, profound and weighty. I had no idea how to respond to that. In all honesty, I wasn&#39;t sure I could continue to manage Ethan. Not while everything was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about what Jack said. Take caution. Could I rely on Ethan? Was he genuinely protecting me, or was he entangling me in something from which I was unable to break free?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the office became vacant, I felt completely worn out. I visited Ethan&#39;s office, wishing that this time we might engage in a significant conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was at his desk, gazing at his laptop when I entered. He didn&#39;t look up when I walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; I said as I closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up, his face as reserved as ever. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back in his chair and moaned. &#34;I thought we already had this conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I firmly answered. &#34;We didn&#39;t. You shut me down like you always do, and I&#39;m done with it. I have a right to know what&#39;s happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the internal conflict in Ethan&#39;s eyes as his jaw tensed. He was still trying to protect me, but from what? And for how long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was low as he said, &#34;I&#39;m keeping you safe. You only need to know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling uncertain, I replied, &#34;I don&#39;t feel secure. Daily, I feel as though I&#39;m being drawn further and further into a labyrinth of enigmas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan got up from his desk and approached me. His gaze was intense as he placed his hands on my shoulders. &#34;Emily, you have to trust me. I&#39;m doing this for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my voice trembling, I replied, &#34;But you&#39;re not telling me anything. You continue to exclude me, so how can I trust you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned away without responding, letting his hands fall off my shoulders. I had no idea how to close the gap that felt like a chasm between us.</p>
