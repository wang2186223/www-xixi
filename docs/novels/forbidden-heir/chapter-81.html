                <p>Like a persistent voice, the buzzing of the fluorescent light above me repeated the annoyance that was building inside me. I gazed at the pile of papers arranged on the inexpensive motel table, each one a lead that was actually a dead end. What did I have after hours of wiretaps and weeks of surveillance? Nothing serious. Only shards, whispers, and shadows that would not form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My train of thought was broken as my phone vibrated. Ben Fisher was the name printed on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ben,&#34; I said in a hard tone. &#34;Tell me you have something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other end stopped long enough for me to tighten my grip on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben paused before saying, &#34;I might have something.&#34; He spoke in a low voice, nearly drowned by background noise, most likely from a bar. &#34;But you won&#39;t enjoy it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The metal legs of the chair creaked under my weight as I leaned back. &#34;I don&#39;t feel like playing games right now. Leak it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben let out a sigh. &#34;You see, Ethan&#39;s paranoia is growing every day. He&#39;s keeping his thoughts to himself. If something big happens, I&#39;m no longer part of the inner circle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was getting impatient, and my tone reflected it. &#34;Ben, you&#39;re meant to be my inside guy. Why are we having this talk if you&#39;re of no benefit to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m trying!&#34; he replied. &#34;However, Ethan is no moron. He knows someone is watching him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squeezed the bridge of my nose and let out a quick breath. &#34;All right. What have you got?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben seemed to be shifting in his seat, as proven by the rustling sound. &#34;He&#39;s been getting to know someone. I&#39;ve never seen this guy before. Always off the books, always late at night. It seems dubious, even for Ethan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened my stance and felt my heart quicken. &#34;Who is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no idea. However, I&#39;ll continue to dig.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d better,&#34; I noted gloomily. &#34;Because you&#39;ll regret it if I find out you&#39;re holding back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben stayed silent, and the call ended. The weight of the chat hung over me like a thick mist as I flung the phone onto the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost midnight had passed when the email arrived. I didn&#39;t recognize the sender&#39;s name: Gerard. No last name. Only Gerard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Critical Information About Ethan Monroe&#34; was the subject line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since anonymous recommendations were usually garbage, I followed my gut and deleted it. However, something made me stop. I opened it and read the short message:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am aware of what Ethan is concealing. I am also aware of Victor. Let&#39;s have a conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor. I was completely stunned at the name. My fingers lingered over the keyboard while suspicion and confusion fought for control of my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was unaware of Victor&#39;s name. Neither the monitoring nor any of the files had mentioned the name. It was the first rift in the wall Ethan had so meticulously built around himself, if this was a genuine lead. Without knowing more, I couldn&#39;t afford to fall for a fake if it was a setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a long look at the email before choosing Reply:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you? What are you aware of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was quicker than I thought it would be, as if Gerard had been expecting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please meet me on Level 3 of the Oakwood parking garage. Tomorrow at midnight. Come by yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My entire alarm system went off at once. It was too particular to ignore, but it also screamed trap. Gerard, whomever he was, had some knowledge. I also needed clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day seemed to drag on like a nightmare in slow motion. I kept thinking about the name Victor. Who was he? What did he have to do with Ethan? I searched the files and went through my notes, but I couldn&#39;t find anything. If Victor ever lived, he had left no trace. He was a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My footsteps echoed off the concrete floor, the sole sound in the almost deserted parking area. The flickering overhead lights made lengthy, unsettling shadows in the poorly lit Level 3.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I got closer to the meeting place, I kept one hand on my holstered handgun. I looked into every nook and corner of the dimly lit room. I wasn&#39;t going down without a fight if this was a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silhouette came from the darkness. Tall, wearing a dark coat, with a hat brim hiding part of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smooth and relaxed voice, the man said, &#34;Richards. My name is Gerard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stated in a firm voice, &#34;You have one minute to convince me that this isn&#39;t a waste of my time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gerard gave a quiet, nearly amused laugh. &#34;All right. First, let&#39;s talk about Victor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I concealed my confusion by crossing my arms. &#34;How about him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tilt of his head, Gerard examined me as if I were a riddle he was trying to answer. &#34;Interesting. You&#39;re not sure, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth, not wanting to show anything. &#34;Why don&#39;t you tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gerard stepped forward, his face unreadable. &#34;Victor Alvarez. Do you know this name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was slapped with the name. I scarcely knew the name Alvarez. Nothing had ever been confirmed, but there were rumors that he was involved with organized crime. I had thought he was a little player who had nothing to do with Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep talking,&#34; I urged, keeping a steady tone despite the mental turbulence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gerard grinned, but it was not noticeable. &#34;The secret to everything is Victor. It eventually boils down to Ethan, Monroe Enterprises, and the entire business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ground underneath me moved. I had been waiting for this break, if Gerard was telling the truth. If he was lying, though...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you telling me this?&#34; I stared as I asked. &#34;What&#39;s your point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gerard grinned broadly. &#34;I have my motives, let&#39;s say. Later, you&#39;ll thank me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed in my pocket before I could press him any further. I stopped and looked at the screen. An email sent by an unnamed sender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evidence Against Ethan Monroe&#34; was the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I studied the contents of the attachment, I felt sick to my stomach. Ethan is linked to a recent high-profile crime by pictures, documents, and timestamps. It was nearly too beautiful-damning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts were racing as I turned back to Gerard. &#34;What on earth is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gerard&#39;s face stayed unchanged. &#34;Think of it as a little prod in the right direction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure if I should be angry or thankful. One thing was certain, though: I was running out of time, and the game had suddenly changed.</p>
