                <p>&#34;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to stay a bit longer?&#34; Emily&#39;s voice carried a quiet hesitance as we walked alongside Ethan toward his sleek black car parked near the hospital entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shook his head. &#34;I&#39;ve been here long enough. There&#39;s work waiting for me back in New York.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed them a little, observing the conversation as it happened. Ever the sympathetic one, Emily appeared hesitant to release him, but Ethan-well, Ethan-was as protective as ever. His face was a mask of serene indifference, but the way his fingers delicately tapped the car keys in his hand gave off an almost restless vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily gently prodded, &#34;It wouldn&#39;t hurt to be here a little longer. Margo&#39;s health...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan cut in, his voice sharp but not rude, &#34;She has you. And you&#39;ve made it clear you&#39;ll do whatever it takes for her. There&#39;s nothing I can add to that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily stopped moving, crossing her arms and furrowing her brows. &#34;Ethan, it&#39;s not about what you can contribute. It&#39;s to let her know she&#39;s not alone. Showing me that you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a little exhale, Ethan raised a hand. &#34;I&#39;m here, aren&#39;t I, Emily? That is more than most people would anticipate. But let&#39;s not pretend I&#39;m the kind of person who&#39;s good at... this.&#34; He gestured vaguely, encompassing both the hospital and the emotional weight of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel the tension between them, and I felt like I was not supposed to be there. I couldn&#39;t help but jump in, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slipped into the conversation with a casual tone and said, &#34;Hey. Let&#39;s not start throwing punches outside a hospital. They might charge extra for the drama.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan laughed dryly, and Emily looked at me, half amused, half frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan unlocked the car door and remarked, &#34;I&#39;ll let you handle the drama, Sophie.&#34; For the final time, he looked at Emily. &#34;If anything changes, give me a call. I&#39;ll handle whatever needs to be handled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Ethan slipped into the driver&#39;s seat and turned on the engine, Emily simply nodded without responding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waved as the car left the lot and shouted, &#34;Drive carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he left, Emily let out a deep breath and lowered her arms to her sides. &#34;Well, that went about as smoothly as I had anticipated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; As we made our way back to the hospital door, I inquired, putting my arm through hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled at me wearily. &#34;I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s just... Ethan. He&#39;s not exactly the warm and fuzzy type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I joked, &#34;That&#39;s putting it mildly,&#34; and she gave me a little laugh. &#34;But seriously, he cares. It&#39;s just buried under layers of, I don&#39;t know, steel armor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we entered, Emily remained silent and stared at the floor. I sensed her withdrawing within herself as the burden of things once more caught up with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned against the wall and watched Emily as she sat down in the chair by her mother&#39;s bed in Margo&#39;s room. The uneasy, weighty silence dragged on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know,&#34; I began cautiously, &#34;he may not show it, but Ethan&#39;s presence here meant something. To both of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily shook her head. &#34;He&#39;s a puzzle I can&#39;t figure out. One moment he&#39;s here, trying to help, and the next he&#39;s back to being distant, like none of this matters to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I persisted, &#34;It does matter to him. Those tough-on-the-outside types, like Ethan, simply don&#39;t know how to express it. But it doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t feel it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes searched me as she looked up. &#34;How do you know what to say all the time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled. &#34;Years of being everyone&#39;s unpaid therapist. It truly is a talent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily laughed softly, and for a moment, the tension eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, after Emily had fallen asleep in the hospital lounge, I was back in our hotel room together. After the long day, the calm, dark room should have been soothing, but my mind kept racing. Even though Ethan&#39;s visit was quick, I still had more questions than answers. I couldn&#39;t get his strange, yet strangely caring, behavior to stop bugging me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat on the bed with my legs crossed and gazed at Emily&#39;s phone on the bedside table. She had checked on a text earlier and left it unlocked. I paused, biting my bottom lip. The idea of phoning Ethan&#39;s pal Ben briefly crossed my mind. He had visited some time ago, and even though we had not spoken much, I had remembered something about his composed manner. Perhaps he knew something about Ethan that would help me understand him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for the phone and whispered to myself, &#34;Don&#39;t overthink it.&#34; I came upon his name while looking through her contacts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled deeply, pressed the call button, and waited, half expecting him to ignore me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; He seemed wary, as if he wasn&#39;t sure who was calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Ben,&#34; I blurted out before I could lose my composure. &#34;This is Sophie. Emily&#39;s... friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief silence. &#34;Sophie. From the other day, that is. Is Emily okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s fine,&#34; I reassured him. &#34;She&#39;s resting. Actually, the reason I called was to discuss something with you. If you don&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he replied, his voice changing to one of interest. &#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsure of how to phrase my inquiry without coming across as intrusive, I hesitated. &#34;It&#39;s about Ethan,&#34; I finally stated. &#34;I don&#39;t know him very well, but... I can&#39;t figure him out. He&#39;s confusing, to say the least.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben laughed softly, but not in a condescending way. &#34;That isn&#39;t shocking. Ethan is a difficult person to understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That much is clear,&#34; I remarked, scowling a little. &#34;But he came all the way here for Emily, and yet it feels like he&#39;s holding back. As if he&#39;s rushing away before someone approaches and doing the bare minimum. Is that just... who he is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben answered cautiously, &#34;It&#39;s complicated. Ethan&#39;s not a bad guy, but he&#39;s got walls. Big ones. And trust me, he didn&#39;t put them up for no reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tangled a lock of hair around my finger as I shifted uneasily. &#34;So, what is it? What&#39;s he so afraid of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben was silent for a while, perhaps considering his answer. At last, he remarked, &#34;Ethan has experienced a lot. More than the majority of people think. And he doesn&#39;t talk about it-not with me, not with anyone. Since he has been by himself for so long, he finds it difficult to let others in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I muttered, my fingers clenching around the phone, &#34;That&#39;s sad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Ben concurred. &#34;But it&#39;s who he is. It doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t care-it just means he doesn&#39;t always know how to show it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back against the pillows and let out a breath. &#34;I appreciate you telling me. I suppose I simply needed to hear it from someone who is more familiar with him than I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No issue,&#34; Ben replied. He paused for a moment before continuing, &#34;And Sophie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let Ethan&#39;s closed-off nature fool you. Although he may be difficult to read, he has a wonderful heart. You simply need to exercise patience with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he couldn&#39;t see me, I nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll remember that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put the phone back on the nightstand after hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had the unshakeable impression that things would only get more confusing as I lay there in the poorly lighted room. I was sucked into the midst of this family&#39;s many facets, which included Ethan, Emily, and Margo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I would stay for Emily&#39;s sake. regardless of how disorganized things got.</p>
