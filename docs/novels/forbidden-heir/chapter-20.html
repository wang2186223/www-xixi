                <p>&#34;Are you sure of this?&#34; Ben&#39;s voice came through the speaker as I sat in the back of my car, the city of New York blurring past the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whispered, clutching my phone more tightly, &#34;I have no other option. Victor isn&#39;t the kind of guy who lets things slide. He will pursue me and Emily if we don&#39;t meet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause on the other end. Ben let out a sigh. &#34;Watch out, Ethan. You&#39;re playing with fire. Victor owns people, he doesn&#39;t bargain. Don&#39;t allow him to own you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I answered, &#34;I&#39;ll handle it,&#34; yet my words carried a lot of weight. I wasn&#39;t sure if I believed it at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vehicle stopped in front of a modern, unmarked building in a quiet spot of the city. The sort of environment where no one ever asked questions and deals were made behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling my coat tightly against the cool night air, I got out of the car. Two men were waiting for me by the entrance; Victor&#39;s men, no doubt. Their faces were odd, and they nodded briefly before guiding me inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked in, Victor was sitting at the far end of the room, drinking a glass of whiskey. Jazz was playing in the background, and the space was softly illuminated. It was all set up to make me feel small and powerless. Victor operated in this manner; he had authority over the people, the surroundings, and the transactions. Everything was under his control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With ease, he said, &#34;Ethan,&#34; and motioned for me to take a seat across from him. &#34;You came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the seat he gave and answered, &#34;I didn&#39;t have much of a choice.&#34; I attempted to speak steadily while my stomach rumbled. Suffocating was the FBI&#39;s weight, the surveillance, and now Victor&#39;s demands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor looked at me, his black eyes glimmering with laughter. &#34;You&#39;re a smart man. I like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting right to the topic, I stated, &#34;I&#39;m here to talk about Emily.&#34; There was no time for games. &#34;She has nothing to do with this. She poses no threat to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back in his chair and swirling the whiskey in his glass, Victor&#39;s smile grew. &#34;Not a threat? Do you think I&#39;m a fool, Ethan? Emily has a significant role in this. You brought her into Monroe Enterprises. You put her on the board.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I countered, &#34;She&#39;s just trying to figure out where she fits in the company. She doesn&#39;t know anything about the real operations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; Victor stated, his tone growing harsh. &#34;She is now a Monroe. She is involved whether or not she is aware of what is happening. Ethan, I also dislike wild cards. You should know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my heart racing, I balled my fists beneath the table. &#34;You don&#39;t need to involve her in this. I am currently in charge of the business. If you have a problem, take it up with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s eyes were keen, and he arched an eyebrow. &#34;You&#39;re loyal. I honor that. But in this industry, loyalty only goes so far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate to find a way to compromise, I leaned forward. &#34;Please, Victor, don&#39;t bring her into it. Whatever you need, I&#39;ll do it. I&#39;ll see to it that everything goes according to plan, but you must keep Emily out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor was silent for a while. Like a predator playing with its prey, he just watched me, a slow smile developing across his face. After putting down his drink, he leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not getting the idea, Ethan. It has nothing to do with what you can give me. This is about control. And I have no control at the moment. You&#39;re trying to balance too many things: the FBI, your father&#39;s business, and now this... girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;FBI? what do you know about that Victor? I asked, &#34;Because they came sniffing around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems you forget who you&#39;re dealing with. Ethan, I don&#39;t like secrets. When were you going to reveal that they were there on a visit?&#34; He fired back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath. &#34;What do you want, then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mood of the room changed, and Victor&#39;s smile dimmed. Something very darker has taken the place of the lighthearted tone. &#34;I want you to get rid of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blood became cold. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor quietly said, &#34;Emily,&#34; as though talking about the weather. &#34;She needs to disappear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got to my feet suddenly, hands shaking. &#34;I&#39;m not going to kill her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s eyes grew gloomy. &#34;I never said you had to murder her. But you need to get her out of the picture. She poses a threat to both you and me if she stays.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The walls were closing in on me, and I was having trouble breathing. &#34;What if I say no?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor did not recoil. &#34;Then she dies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was struck by the words. He wasn&#39;t playing a game. His eyes showed it to me. Victor Alvarez didn&#39;t threaten people pointlessly. It was Emily&#39;s life on the line if I didn&#39;t cooperate. And I was solely to blame, I had brought her into this situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor got up and straightened his jacket, ready to go. &#34;Ethan, you have a week. Get Emily out of the company, or I&#39;ll handle it myself. And you don&#39;t want that, I assure you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt colder and more empty as Victor and his guys left. I found myself torn between two evils: Victor, who was willing to kill to further his own agenda, and the FBI, who were already encroaching on Monroe Enterprises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I parked outside the restaurant where I was supposed to meet Emily later that evening. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to answer her message when my phone buzzed, wondering where I was. How could I? Knowing that Victor had just threatened me with her life or my commitment, how could I sit across from her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the weight of the world bearing down on me, I rested my head back on the seat. I was stuck in any case, but I had to make a choice. I would lose everything my father had built and everything I had worked for if I joined Victor. But Emily wouldn&#39;t live if I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could still hear Victor&#39;s message: Get her out of the picture, or she dies.</p>
