                <p>Like a heavy cloud, the tension from my run-in with Ethan stayed in the air.  With every stiff steps, I could see Ethan&#39;s anger and surprise as he stormed out of the room as I stood frozen.  The burden of everything was pulling on me, forcing my heart to pound in my chest.  This was not how I had intended things to work out.  I wasn&#39;t sure whether I could manage the reality, even though I had desired answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack stopped talking and cleared his throat.  I turned to face him and noted that his typically calm look had altered to one of sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Em, you should exercise caution,&#34; he advised kindly but seriously.  &#34;You find yourself in a very vulnerable situation now that you know who your father is and what we&#39;ve discovered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion pinched my brow.  &#34;Please clarify what you mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack sat forward in his seat and caught my gaze.  &#34;The Monroe family has formidable enemies.  In addition to his engagement in financial activities, Henry is connected to ruthless individuals who would not be happy with what we have found out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill raced through my body.  That had never even occurred to me.  I hadn&#39;t thought about the wider repercussions since I had been consumed with the family&#39;s secrets and my connection with Henry.  There might have been others out there who didn&#39;t want those secrets to be revealed if Henry had engaged in illegal activities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whispered, barely audible, &#34;I never asked for any of this. I want to remain outside of this world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack offered a pliable nod.  &#34;I know.  However, since you are now connected to it, you must exercise discretion in your activities.  People will stop at nothing to defend their interests, and since you&#39;re tied to the Monroe family, you can find yourself in their crosshairs. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made my heart race.  I had taught children in a tiny village my entire life, lived a humble, peaceful life.  And now I was being informed that something I could not control could put me in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should I do now?&#34;  My voice quiver a little as I asked.  &#34;How can I protect myself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack reclined in his chair, his expression serious.  &#34;You should remain still for the time being, in my opinion.  Avoid making a big deal out of yourself and don&#39;t tell too many people about your relationship with Henry.  You&#39;ll be safer the less others know about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, deep down I was full of fear.  I felt like I was drowning in this world of riches and power, which was not something I was used to.  It was terrible to think that I might be in danger or that someone might pursue me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed toward the broad windows that framed the skyline of the city and murmured, &#34;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m safe here.&#34;  The panorama of New York was intimidating and chilly now, yet it had always appeared so huge and exhilarating.  &#34;Should I return home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack scowled and hesitated for a time.  &#34;It&#39;s not that easy.  Things could grow worse if you leave now.  You might be asked questions that you don&#39;t want to respond to. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed myself to swallow as I fought to quell the increasing panic in my chest.  I was limited.  I had to take a gamble by staying, but I couldn&#39;t just leave this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calmer tone, Jack said, &#34;You&#39;re not alone in this. We&#39;ll sort things out.  However, you need to approach it carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave another nod, even if the words didn&#39;t actually soothe my uneasiness.  Everything seemed so unsafe and uncertain.  Never before had I felt so vulnerable and out of place.  And now, I was starting to question where in this city I was truly safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t get rid of the unsettling sensation that was hanging over me as I headed back to my hotel.  Every step I took felt heavier and more uncertain as Jack&#39;s warning continued to ring in my mind.  The normal bustle of New York was noticeable on the streets as it was getting close to 7 PM.  But rather than being energized by the hustle of the city, I felt exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made an effort to ignore the fear that was eating at me by convincing myself I was overreacting.  I had only been in New York for a few days, after all.  Perhaps all of the pressure was just beginning to get to me, the will, the family secrets, the tension with Ethan.  However, I got a gut feeling that something wasn&#39;t quite right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the chilly evening air, I drew my coat firmly about me as I went.  The skyscrapers in the city towered over me.  Couples strolling hand in hand, people rushing home from work, and the typical buzz of traffic filled the streets.  Still, I felt like I was being watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I only had a slight twinge of uneasiness at first, a constant sense that someone was watching me.  After Jack&#39;s warning, I convinced myself that it was all in my imagination and that nothing was wrong.  But something or someone, that I observed as I passed a group of persons waiting at a crosswalk had my heart skip a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man.  The person standing a few steps behind me was tall and wearing a dark coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I initially felt he was merely another passerby going about his daily routine.  However, I saw that he had also crossed the street at that moment.  He followed me when I turned left onto another street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heartbeat quickened, and I felt the cool air hurt my flesh.  Trying to be discrete, I threw a quick peek over my shoulder, but he was still there, moving at the same speed as me.  My thoughts raced, continuously playing back what Jack had uttered.  The rivals of the Monroe family are...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to continue on, to look as composed as possible, but my mind was racing.  Was someone pursuing me?  Was this man watching me?  Or was I just imagining things too much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned down a different street, assuming that he would disappear into the crowd, but when I saw him again, closer this time, the knot of panic in my breast intensified.  I felt panic run through me so I hastened my pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to return to the hotel. I had to get to a safe spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crept into a nearby store and pretended to examine the products, but all the while, my eyes flew to the window to check if the man had followed me in.  However, he didn&#39;t.  He waited outside, standing at the corner, peering down the street as though he was expecting I would emerge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my hands and reached for my phone to call Jack.  The phone rang once, twice, and then he answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily?&#34;  Jack&#39;s voice was calm as ever as he spoke across the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I trembled as I muttered, &#34;Jack. I think I am being followed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man on the other end of the line hesitated for a second.  &#34;What is your location?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked anxiously out the window and added, &#34;I&#39;m at a shop near the hotel. However, a man has been stalking me for several blocks.  I have no idea what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay where you are,&#34; Jack warned.  &#34;Keep away from going outside again until I get there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my heart beating in my chest, I nodded.  &#34;All right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Jack concluded the call, I laid my phone aside while attempting to calm down.  My head was full with inquiries.  This man, who was he?  What made him follow me?  Was this related to the mysteries of Henry?  To the rivals Jack had informed me of?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hid in the store and pretended to look around, but all the time, my eyes were fluttering back and forth to the door.  I was waiting for Jack to arrive, and the minutes seemed to stretch on forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what seemed like hours, I eventually recognized Jack&#39;s identifiable form strolling down the street.  He ran into the store, his eyes darting around in search of the man I&#39;d described.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;come on,&#34; he said in a controlled yet strong tone.  &#34;Let&#39;s take you to the hotel,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heart thumping, I followed him out of the store.  As we walked, I looked over my shoulder, but the man was no longer there.  I wasn&#39;t sure if he had fled on his own or vanished after seeing Jack.  However, the uneasiness remained, gnawing at me like an invading shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack looked serious as he took me to my room when we arrived at the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you certain you didn&#39;t identify the man?&#34;  Once inside, Jack requested in a hushed voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a headshake.  &#34;I haven&#39;t seen him before.  However, he was obviously after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack dragged his fingers through his hair and moaned.  &#34;This is precisely the thing that scared me.  Emily, you should take greater caution.  There are people who could try to take advantage of you in order to obtain access to the Monroe family. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath as his words began to register.  &#34;Now, what should I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, Jack added, just be attentive.  Don&#39;t venture out by yourself.  Call me right away if you encounter that man or anyone else who seems suspicious again. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nagging worry in my stomach, I nodded.  I wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted to know the truth now that I wasn&#39;t in New York looking for answers.  The deeper I stepped into Henry&#39;s universe, the more dangerous it appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat on the edge of the bed, my mind racing as Jack exited the room.  It felt as though the truth was smashing everything around me, contrary to my previous idea that discovering the truth would offer me some type of tranquility.  Furthermore, I was powerless to stop Henry&#39;s opponents&#39; shadow from descending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the question was whether I was at all safe here.</p>
