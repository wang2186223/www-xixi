                <p>&#34;Are you serious about taking this vacation?&#34; As we left the apartment building and entered the refreshing morning air, Emily questioned, giving me a sidelong glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, seeming particularly serious. &#34;It is necessary for both of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for a while, still feeling the consequences of her choice. She clearly had a desire to flee from me, from the secrets, from all the tension that had accumulated over the previous few weeks. However, there was a part of her that still harbored strong feelings for me and believed that this trip would be a chance to turn things around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she exhaled softly and replied, &#34;Okay. Let&#39;s get it done. I&#39;ll drop the apartment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her comments caused my shoulders to relax. I had a tremendous surge of relief. &#34;I&#39;m grateful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an eyebrow raised, she cautioned, &#34;But don&#39;t think this fixes everything. Ethan, you still need to speak with me. We cannot continue in this manner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave another nod. &#34;I understand. And I will. once we&#39;ve left all of this chaos behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Emily didn&#39;t seem completely convinced, I walked her outside to the car&#39;s parking lot, got her in, and closed the door. I could feel the tension building as I approached the driver&#39;s side; the stillness between us was long and the tension was boiling just below the surface. I kept looking at her to see how she was feeling, but she was deep in contemplation, staring out the window. Victor, the FBI, and now Emily were all things I had to deal with. I had no idea how to balance everything without it all falling apart, and everyone wanted something from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I had to put up a front, to keep things smooth until we were on that vacation. Then perhaps I could find a way to explain it all without destroying what was left of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sensed a change in the mood as soon as we entered Monroe Enterprises. Before she left for her office, Emily offered me a little, almost reluctant grin, but I could sense the distance in her eyes. She was still indecisive. I needed to convince her that the vacation was a good idea. If she changed her mind now, everything would fall apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack was standing outside my office door with his arms crossed and a frustrated expression on his face before I had even had time to collect my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack abruptly stated, &#34;Ethan, we need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a quick look at Emily&#39;s vanishing form before turning back to Jack. &#34;Sure. Let&#39;s do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack nodded toward the entrance of my office and said, &#34;Inside.&#34; His tone made it clear to me that this would not be a friendly conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack wasted no time after the door shut behind us. &#34;What the hell is going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scowled, acting as though I didn&#39;t understand. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s tolerance was obviously becoming thin as he yelled, &#34;Cut the crap, Ethan. For weeks, the FBI has been investigating the business. First, it&#39;s financial records. Now that they&#39;re getting more specific, nothing feels quite right. I am the company&#39;s attorney. I must know what is happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of the secrets I had been keeping threatened to break me, and I felt my heartbeat increase. Jack had been managing the legal department of Monroe Enterprises for many years. He was entitled to answers, but I wasn&#39;t sure I was prepared for the new level of issues that would arise if I told him the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an attempt to buy time, I murmured, &#34;Jack, it&#39;s... complicated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Complicated?&#34; Jack&#39;s voice became irritated. &#34;Do you think I&#39;m an idiot? I&#39;ve worked for this company long enough to recognize when something is really wrong. The FBI doesn&#39;t just investigate on a whim. What exactly are they trying to find?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my head racing, I clinched my hands. I couldn&#39;t avoid this any longer. Jack was right when he said he wouldn&#39;t let it go. He had every right to know what was happening because he was Monroe Enterprises&#39; attorney.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right, all right,&#34; I gritted my teeth and said. &#34;You&#39;re looking for the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack narrowed his eyes and folded his arms. &#34;Yes. The truth is what I want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words caught in my throat as I inhaled deeply. &#34;My father wasn&#39;t really operating the spotless company you believed him to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack scowled more deeply. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whispered, &#34;Henry was involved in arms deals,&#34; feeling the weight of the admission hit me more forcefully than I had anticipated. &#34;Monroe Enterprises was a front. The FBI is looking into this because they are beginning to piece together the entire scheme.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in years, I witnessed genuine amazement on Jack&#39;s face as his eyes expanded. &#34;Arms deals? Are you telling me, Ethan, that Henry was smuggling weapons via Monroe Enterprises?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, my throat constricted, I nodded. &#34;Victor Alvarez... he&#39;s the one who orchestrated the whole thing. My father covered it up, but now that he&#39;s gone, they&#39;re coming after the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack looked at me as if he couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing, and he was silent for a while. The bang echoed throughout the office as he abruptly smashed his fist down on my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long have you been aware of this?&#34; Jack&#39;s voice was filled with anger as he demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A few weeks,&#34; I said, attempting to seem calm. &#34;I&#39;ve been trying to determine how to handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you didn&#39;t consider telling me?&#34; Jack&#39;s rage was evident as his voice increased. &#34;Ethan, I&#39;m your attorney! I could have been of assistance to you. I could have handled this and shielded you from what was about to happen. But instead, you&#39;ve been sitting on this, letting things get worse!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to keep you out of it!&#34; With my own frustration erupting, I fired back. &#34;I believed that I could manage it without making matters worse for anybody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Making things worse?&#34; Jack repeated, his expression contorted in shock. &#34;Can you hear yourself at all? Ethan, you&#39;ve been playing with fire and you&#39;re in over your head. Do you really believe you can defeat Victor Alvarez on your own? Without assistance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had no other option!&#34; I slammed my hands down on the desk in a jerk. &#34;Jack, what was I meant to do? Inform the board that the business in which they have invested millions of dollars is a cover for illicit arms sales. That would destroy everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Destroy everything?&#34; With a low, menacing voice, Jack shook his head. &#34;By hiding this from the individuals who might help you, you will ruin everything. The FBI is currently pursuing us, and it won&#39;t be long before they discover anything that they can use against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was unable to argue with him. Jack was right. I was frantically trying to keep things from falling apart because I had allowed it to go too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I responded, scarcely raising my voice above a whisper, &#34;I&#39;ll fix it. I&#39;ll figure out how to handle Victor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack chuckled bitterly. &#34;Ethan, how precisely are you going to accomplish that? You are up against a master criminal. He won&#39;t simply let you leave this situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere,&#34; I whispered. &#34;But I&#39;m also not going to let him take over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack looked at me, clearly frustrated. &#34;You believe that keeping this a secret will help? Ethan, you have no idea what you just let loose.</p>
