                <p>&#34;All right, let me do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I uttered those four words, they seemed to weigh a thousand pounds. I waited for Victor&#39;s answer, my grasp getting tighter around the phone and my knuckles going white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other end of the line paused for a moment before Victor&#39;s gravelly, low voice could be heard. &#34;All right. Ethan, I knew you would see reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth and tried to remain composed. This was part of the plan. I would have the leverage I needed to compile evidence against Victor and ultimately bring him down if I agreed to collaborate with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But there&#39;s one condition,&#34; I stated, maintaining my composure in spite of the underlying wrath. &#34;Emily stays out of this. She&#39;s off-limits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor laughed softly. &#34;So you still believe you can keep her safe? How... noble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my hold on the phone and added, &#34;I&#39;m serious. The deal is off if you don&#39;t leave her alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence for a while, and I wasn&#39;t sure if Victor would agree at first. But at last he said something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right,&#34; he answered sharply. &#34;I&#39;m not stressed over Emily. I will not interfere with her affairs as long as she doesn&#39;t disrupt mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a sigh. &#34;Great.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s tone darkened as he proceeded, &#34;However, don&#39;t assume that this implies you&#39;re in charge. You work for me now, Ethan. And you&#39;ll follow my instructions when I say them. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor&#39;s tone changed once more, returning to the easygoing, almost friendly manner that made my skin crawl. &#34;Before we proceed, there is one more thing to do. A small loyalty test, if you will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart fell. I had a feeling I knew where this was going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor went on, &#34;One of my business partners has been getting... sloppy,&#34; in a silky yet menacing way. &#34;He has been disclosing information that could endanger us both. I need you to handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of what he was asking fell on me, and I froze. &#34;Handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor said icily, &#34;Ethan, you know what I mean. This is your test. Prove to me that you&#39;re with me, and get rid of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t murder somebody. I couldn&#39;t do it no matter how involved I got in this. But if I didn&#39;t, Victor would know I wasn&#39;t truly on his side. And it would be over if he thought I was going to betray him. For me. For Emily. For everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, my words tasting like ash, &#34;I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My skin crawled as Victor laughed with satisfaction. &#34;All right. You&#39;ve got forty-eight hours. Don&#39;t let me down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had I gotten myself into?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some hours later, Ben stormed into my office without his typical smile. After glancing at my face, he realized something wasn&#39;t right. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran a hand through my hair as I reclined in my chair. &#34;Ben, I&#39;m in deep. Victor is no longer playing around. He wants me to take out one of his partners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben sat down next me when his eyes expanded. &#34;Hold on, what? As in, kill him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the weight of the world bearing down on me as I nodded. &#34;Yeah. And if I don&#39;t, he&#39;ll think I&#39;m not really with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jesus, Ethan,&#34; Ben mumbled as he wiped his beard. &#34;You can&#39;t go through with this. There&#39;s gotta be another way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that,&#34; I said, my annoyance rising to the surface. &#34;But what choice do I have? I&#39;m already being choked by Victor. He will turn against me if I don&#39;t do this. And if he finds out I&#39;m planning to take him down... it&#39;s game over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben sighed as he shook his head. &#34;Dude, this is terrible. Very terrible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned forward and buried my face in my hands, muttering, &#34;I know. Ben, I&#39;m stuck. I see no escape route.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben remained quiet for a long time, and his voice was low when he did speak. &#34;What about the FBI?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned as I looked up. &#34;What about them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s eyes were keen as he leaned closer. &#34;They&#39;re already sniffing around Monroe Enterprises. Maybe it&#39;s time to let them in. Use them to help take down Victor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;No. Not quite yet. Before I call the FBI, I need to collect more proof. They will drag me down with him if I approach them right away. And I can&#39;t take that chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what&#39;s the strategy?&#34; Ben&#39;s voice was tight as he asked. &#34;Ethan, you can&#39;t kill this guy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I firmly stated, &#34;I&#39;m not going to,&#34; as my thoughts raced with potential solutions. I will find a solution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day was a haze of phone calls and meetings, but I wasn&#39;t thinking about anything. Each passing minute seemed to be a countdown to my impending failure. Time was of the essence; Victor had given me 48 hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By late afternoon, I was outside the office of Paul Anderson, a longtime business associate of Monroe Enterprises, the guy Victor wanted dead. I&#39;d known him for years, worked alongside him, and now Victor wanted me to end him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled deeply, my thoughts whirling with potential. This had to be handled without going over that boundary. I simply needed to be clever about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I eventually entered Paul&#39;s office, he smiled warmly at me. &#34;Ethan! It&#39;s nice to see you, pal. Why have you come here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the guilt still nagging at me, I faked a smile. &#34;Paul, I just needed to talk. I have some... concerns I need to talk to you about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul motioned for me to sit while his smile dimmed a little. &#34;Concerns? What kind of concerns?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a seat. I could not inform him of the true situation just yet. However, Victor would ensure that this talk never took place again if I didn&#39;t take action right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deliberate word choice, I spoke slowly, &#34;I&#39;ve been hearing some things. Things pertaining to leaks. Information that shouldn&#39;t be out there&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Paul&#39;s face turned pale, I realized Victor was right. He was at fault. However, that did not imply that I was going to murder him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, what are you talking about?&#34; Paul&#39;s voice trailed off as he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made up my mind and got up. &#34;Paul, you have forty-eight hours to vanish. Get out of the city, go underground. Let&#39;s just say that some people want you gone if you don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul&#39;s eyes were wide with terror as he gazed at me. &#34;Are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to the door and said, &#34;Dead serious. And if I were you, I wouldn&#39;t wait around to find out if I&#39;m bluffing.&#34;</p>
