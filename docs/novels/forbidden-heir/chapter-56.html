                <p>The air in Jack&#39;s office felt stifling as the weight of his accusations hung between us. I resisted the temptation to lash out or display any remorse, keeping my face neutral. Emily was standing next to me with her arms folded and a confused, angry look on her face. This wasn&#39;t how things were supposed to go. Jack had gone too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a cold stare while carefully selecting my words. &#34;Jack, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. The whole story sounds absurd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily&#39;s brows furrowed as her eyes suddenly shifted to mine. &#34;Ethan, really? because you appear quite agitated for someone who is supposedly not aware.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw tensed, but I made an effort to shrug. &#34;Agitated? Emily, Jack just brought us here to make accusations. I&#39;m not hiding anything; I&#39;m just frustrated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t buy it, though. Her displeasure was building, and I could see it in her eyes as the uncertainty took hold. Jack watched us with a grim expression on his face and his arms crossed as if he were challenging me to maintain the act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily said in a tense voice, her rage evident, &#34;Ethan, are you really going to stand here and act like you don&#39;t know anything about Victor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I maintained my position while trying to maintain a neutral expression. &#34;I have no idea what Jack is discussing. Victor was a name tossed around by people who like to spin conspiracy theories about the Monroe family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack laughed drearily. &#34;Ethan, conspiracy theories? Is it your best option? Since you won&#39;t tell Emily the truth, I conducted my own investigation because she needs to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave Jack a stern look. &#34;And what gives you the authority to begin discussing your alleged &#34;investigation&#34; with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily shook her head and exhaled in frustration. &#34;This is unbelievable. I thought, Ethan. I thought that we were all in this together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though her remarks hurt, I kept my composure. I turned to her instead, trying to seem calm. I&#39;m being honest with you, Emily. &#34;Jack is exaggerating things, and his theories are based on thin evidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was already gathering her bag, her face hardening as she looked from Jack to me, disappointment evident in her eyes. Her voice was hardly audible above a whisper as she mumbled, &#34;I can&#39;t do this. I&#39;m done with all these secrets,&#34; she continued, raising her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without even looking back, she turned and stormed out of the office. I watched her go, annoyance seething beneath my composed exterior. Sophie, who had been standing outside, gave me a shocked, wide-eyed look before she and Emily left. Jack and I were alone when the office door closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mask came off as soon as Emily and Sophie left. With rage burning in my eyes, I turned to face Jack. &#34;What the hell was that, Jack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack, obviously disappointed, arched an eyebrow. &#34;Ethan, you ought to have told her the truth long ago. That&#39;s what I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I balled my fists and forced myself to control my escalating rage. &#34;You think blindsiding her was not helping?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack shrugged, unconcerned with my response. &#34;You can&#39;t keep her in the dark forever, Ethan. Whether you like it or not, she is involved in all of this. And the more you hide, the worse it&#39;ll get when she finally learns the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to maintain my composure as I said, &#34;She doesn&#39;t need to know everything. It&#39;s better if she&#39;s kept out of the worst of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack gave a dry laugh. &#34;If you believe that lying to her will protect her, you are insane. The world you&#39;re tangled up in, Ethan-it&#39;s not something you can just shield her from with a few lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed resentfully. &#34;You truly believe you have everything worked out, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face was stern and unflinching. &#34;Ethan, I am aware that Victor is not the kind to give up. He&#39;s not going to let go just because you want to play hero and keep Emily safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my jaw as the weight of his remarks descended upon me. I couldn&#39;t ignore Victor Alvarez as a threat, but it didn&#39;t give Jack the right to involve Emily. I had been making every effort to shield her from the evil Victor stood for, but Jack simply had to upset the delicate equilibrium I had been attempting to preserve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snarled in a low voice, &#34;You had no right to say anything to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s eyes become stony. &#34;No right? I am her attorney, Ethan, and since you obviously refused to inform her of the situation, I conducted my own investigation and provided her with the information she needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Investigation?&#34; I fired back. &#34;Jack, this isn&#39;t a matter for you to look into. You&#39;re getting into much too much trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I?&#34; Jack retorted, refusing to budge. &#34;Because, as far as I can tell, Ethan, you are the one drowning. You&#39;re lying to everyone and acting like you&#39;re still in charge while you&#39;re involved with Victor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my hands and took a step closer. &#34;Don&#39;t pretend that you understand any of this. You have no idea what I&#39;m going through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes remained fixed. &#34;Even though I may not be fully informed, I can see that you&#39;re headed in a bad direction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw tightened as I made an effort to suppress the rage that was building within of me. &#34;You think you&#39;re helping by throwing accusations around in front of Emily? You think blindsiding her with talk about Victor was your way of doing what&#39;s best for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaffected by my tone, Jack folded his arms. &#34;At least I&#39;m telling the truth. which I can&#39;t say enough about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to force myself to remain composed because the accusation hurt. &#34;Jack, I&#39;m taking care of it. You don&#39;t have to get involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a laugh slipping out of his mouth, he said, &#34;Taking care of it?&#34; You&#39;re hiding things from everyone who is trying to help you, Ethan. You&#39;re lying to me, to Emily, and, at this point, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re lying to yourself as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hardly managed to keep my voice steady as I scowled at him. &#34;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step closer, and his face softened slightly. &#34;I&#39;ve known you for years, Ethan. I am aware of the weight you are bearing. But continuing like this? Continuing to work with someone like Victor? It will ruin you and bring everyone you love down with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yelled, &#34;Then, Jack, don&#39;t get involved. If you&#39;re so worried about other people, then stop getting involved in things that don&#39;t affect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack shook his head in a forceful but sad tone. &#34;Ethan, you are the only person I&#39;m worried about here. If you continue like this, you will be killed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made up a sour chuckle. &#34;You think I&#39;m afraid of Victor? I can handle him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack gave me a look that was a mix of disappointment and sympathy. &#34;Ethan, you&#39;re not invincible. And despite everything you say, I know you&#39;re not quite as certain of this as you act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remarks struck closer to home than I wanted to acknowledge, so I turned away. Jack was correct about one thing: I had been lying to myself just as much as I had been lying to Emily. Victor was not someone to be taken lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; Jack said in a softer, almost soft voice. &#34;You&#39;ve been in contact with him, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every instinct told me to maintain the façade and deny it, so I tensed. But I could tell by the expression in Jack&#39;s eyes that he already understood. Lying to him now would be useless.</p>
