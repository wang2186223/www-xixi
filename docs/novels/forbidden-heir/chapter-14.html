                <p>&#34;Ding dong&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doorbell rang again. For the last hour, it has been ringing continuously. I heard the commotion outside; cameras flashing, reporters yelling, and people calling my name. all as a result of Ethan&#39;s statement. He hadn&#39;t even given me a heads-up or given me time to get ready. My life would never be the same now everyone knew that I was Henry Monroe&#39;s daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a quick look through the window. At least a dozen reporters were waiting for me to go outside, some of them with cameras and others with microphones. I took a step back. I couldn&#39;t deal with this. I had to leave, but there was nowhere to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Clark! Miss Clark! What details about your relationship with the Monroes can you share with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you feel about the inheritance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily! Are you really the illegitimate daughter of Henry Monroe?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willow Creek was no longer safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped as the phone rang on the coffee table. It was Sophie, again. I was hesitant to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily!&#34; Sophie&#39;s voice on the other end was desperate. &#34;I watched the news! Are you all right? What is going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an attempt to make sense of it all, I put my palm to my forehead. &#34;I&#39;m not sure. Ethan just made the announcement. Reporters are now everywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you going to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced the room and said, &#34;I don&#39;t know. I had no idea that he would do this. I can&#39;t even go outside the house anymore without getting followed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you should go to New York,&#34; Sophie suggested gently. &#34;At least you wouldn&#39;t have to handle this alone because you&#39;d be with Ethan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>New York. I wasn&#39;t prepared to return to that city. After what Ethan had done, I wasn&#39;t prepared to confront him. But staying here wasn&#39;t an option either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a trembling voice, I responded, &#34;I&#39;ll figure something out. I just need some time to think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please be careful, Emily,&#34; Sophie said. &#34;This whole thing, it&#39;s too much. I don&#39;t like how things are going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to seem more resilient than I actually was, &#34;I&#39;ll be fine. I just need to get away from here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, I looked toward the front door. It was only a matter of time before they tried to come in. I couldn&#39;t stay here. I snatched up my jacket, flung it on, and walked for the door in the hopes of reaching the car before the reporters caught up with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were on me as soon as I went outside. I was surrounded by voices, microphones were flung at me, and cameras flashed in my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Clark! Miss Clark! Do you have a statement about the inheritance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your connection to the Monroe family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily! Are you on your way to New York?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my heart pounding, I tried to push past them. They were everywhere, obstructing my way, shouting questions, and taking pictures. It was oppressive. I hadn&#39;t asked for any of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just leave me alone, please!&#34; Trying to cover my face, I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, they continued. With their cameras aimed like weapons at me, they continued to push and follow. I started running and ran for my parked car on the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an attempt to catch my breath, I slammed the car door shut. I could still hear the cameras clicking and the shouting even behind the glass. I had to leave this place quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more, my phone buzzed. It was Ethan this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a good look at the screen before responding. &#34;What the hell were you thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to do it, Emily,&#34; Ethan remarked in a cool tone. &#34;The media was already getting close. You couldn&#39;t keep hiding in Willow Creek. It was just a question of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, without asking me, you chose to put me in the spotlight?&#34; I lost my temper. &#34;I&#39;m stuck now. There are reporters everywhere. I can&#39;t even leave my house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan softened his tone and continued, &#34;I know. But that was the only way to keep you safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep me safe?&#34; I sneered. &#34;Ethan, you&#39;ve just made me a target. You&#39;ve made everything worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;There was no other way. It would have been worse if they had discovered you sooner rather than later. We have control over the narrative now that it is public knowledge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Control the narrative?&#34; I said it again, raising my voice. &#34;I&#39;m not a narrative you can make up, Ethan. This is my life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; he muttered. &#34;But now it&#39;s your life. Whether you like it or not, you are a part of this. The sooner you accept that, the better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clutched the steering wheel as my thoughts raced. In a sense, he was correct. Now I was involved in this. There was no turning back. However, that didn&#39;t make it any simpler to accept what he had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now what?&#34; Trying to speak steadily, I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you need to come back to New York,&#34; Ethan said firmly. &#34;Willow Creek is no longer a safe place for you. You don&#39;t have the tools to cope with the media, and they won&#39;t go away. I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re safe when you return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Safe from what?&#34; Bitterly, I asked. Do you think that if I visit New York, the media will stop? They will simply follow me there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered, &#34;I can control the situation at least in New York. You won&#39;t be by yourself. You will have privacy and security, everything you need to manage this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you?&#34; Quietly, I asked. &#34;How about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause. &#34;Emily, I&#39;ll be here. You won&#39;t have to face this alone, I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his words lingered between us, I noticed something unexpected in his voice for the first time: concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned my head back on the seat and sighed. &#34;I have no other option, do I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Ethan said. &#34;You don&#39;t. This is your life now.&#34;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call came to an end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too busy to give it much thought. I was startled out of my thoughts by the sound of a knock on the car&#39;s window. A journalist. She was tapping on the window with a microphone in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Clark, do you have any comments on the announcement? Are you on your way to New York?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started the car and moved away from the window. I needed to leave this place. New York was dangerous, yes, but what was I supposed to do? Remain here and let the press to destroy me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed the accelerator and backed out of the driveway. Despite the fact that I had no plan, I was certain that I had to leave Willow Creek.</p>
