                <p>&#34;I thought you wouldn&#39;t show up,&#34; Jack said as he leaned back against the doorframe of Ethan&#39;s office. The seriousness of what he said was clear from his sad face. &#34;Sophia just called me. Emily&#39;s mom is in the hospital with cancer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was reading the contract, the pen in my hand moved over it. I didn&#39;t look up. I said, &#34;That&#39;s... unfortunate,&#34; and the words sounded as cold as my own body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack walked in and shut the door behind him. &#34;You didn&#39;t hear from her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crossed his arms and whispered, &#34;She wouldn&#39;t.&#34; She most likely thinks you wouldn&#39;t give a damn. which you don&#39;t, based on the information provided.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack went on. &#34;In a way, you are now her family. Emily will expect at least a visit from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned as he twirled the pen between his hands. &#34;She didn&#39;t make any requests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a composed, distant look, I glanced up at him. &#34;And, Jack, what precisely do you want me to accomplish? Deliver flowers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, she doesn&#39;t require flowers. She needs assistance. You&#39;ve been avoiding her, and we both understand why. It&#39;s not about you, though. Showing her that you care, or at least acting as though you do, is the goal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pinched the bridge of my nose and sat back in my chair. Jack had a knack of making me angry, and worse, he was usually right. &#34;All right. Plan a flight. I&#39;ll leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s already finished,&#34; Jack said, his voice becoming a little lower. &#34;Just... don&#39;t mess this up, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to New York, Willow Creek was smaller and quieter. It was a ridiculous analogy, of course, but I&#39;ve spent my entire childhood in New York, a town where everyone knew one another. Finding the hospital didn&#39;t take long. As soon as I entered, I was struck by the sterile smell, which made my stomach turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie was holding a bunch of daisies when I arrived at the front desk. When she noticed me, her eyes narrowed slightly and she froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; she stated in a bland tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophie.&#34; I nodded while keeping a courteous tone. &#34;I came to see how Margo was doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I briefly believed she was telling me to go as her lips made a thin line. Rather, she pointed down the hallway. &#34;Room 312.&#34; Emily is with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around before I left. &#34;I must apologize to you for what happened the other day. I was not in line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hid her surprise immediately after her eyes opened significantly. &#34;I appreciate you saying that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave another nod and went down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tiny room was filled with the sound of machinery. Emily&#39;s hand rested lightly on her mother&#39;s as she sat next to Margo. At first, she was too busy with whatever peaceful time they were having together to notice me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily&#39;s eyes widened in astonishment as she looked up suddenly as I entered the room. &#34;Ethan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a nod. &#34;I came to check up on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margo turned her head, a grin of kindness lighting up her pale face. She said in a quiet but strong voice, &#34;You must be Ethan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step toward the bed and replied, &#34;I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here,&#34; she answered, making a feeble hand gesture. &#34;Give me a chance to examine you properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reluctantly took a place next to her. Her weak but tight grasp forced me to pause as she reached for my hand. She laughed softly and added, &#34;So, you&#39;re the elusive one. Emily mentions you more than she knows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She does?&#34; Emily rolled her eyes but stayed silent as I looked at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She does,&#34; Margo said in a joking tone. &#34;And, I&#39;ll be honest, not always in the most flattering ways. However, I believe she is wrong about you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scowled. &#34;How wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the most defensive person may be charmed by Margo&#39;s smile. &#34;You&#39;re not as aloof as you act.&#34; It&#39;s visible in your eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsure of how to respond, I paused. Margo&#39;s eyes were piercing, almost dangerously so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some while, she added, &#34;You don&#39;t have to talk. I understand. This type of event is unfamiliar to you. Actually, neither am I. But thank you for coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said in a calm tone, &#34;It was the least I could do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margo gave a little laugh. That&#39;s a really professional answer. Do you constantly act that serious, or is it only when you&#39;re among individuals you don&#39;t really know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave Emily a look as she choked back a giggle. Margo&#39;s smile widened as she realized. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not trying to make you look bad. Well, not totally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaccustomed to this kind of lightheartedness, I shifted uncomfortably. &#34;My goal is to help Emily. I added, almost as an aside, &#34;and you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a softer tone, Margo noted, &#34;That means a lot.&#34; However, don&#39;t make this a job. Life isn&#39;t long enough for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed silent since I had no response for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margo studied me, tilting her head. After a minute, she noted, &#34;You remind me of someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who?&#34; Even though I wasn&#39;t sure I wanted to know, I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said, &#34;Henry,&#34; with a hint of something I couldn&#39;t quite identify in her voice. But not the aspects of him that are usually discussed. You possess his drive and energy. However, you have his loneliness as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words caused my chest to tighten. Emily gave me a wide-eyed look, as though she was also hearing something for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied, &#34;I&#39;m not lonely,&#34; sounding more defensive than I meant to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margo smiled at me knowingly. &#34;If you say so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a short while, there was silence in the room as the impact of her words weighed on each of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margo finally broke the silence. &#34;Ethan, thank you for coming,&#34; she whispered softly. &#34;And for keeping an eye on Emily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsure of what else to say, I nodded. &#34;Be careful, Margo,&#34; I murmured, taking a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I turned to go, she continued to stare at me and said, &#34;You too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept thinking about Margo&#39;s words as I made my way down the corridor to the waiting room. His loneliness is yours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not wrong. However, she wasn&#39;t totally right either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arriving at the waiting area, I sank into a chair and allowed the buzzing electric lights to overpower my thoughts. For the time being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except for the flickering television in the corner, the room was empty. I was engaged in my thoughts as I gazed at it, not actually seeing anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily was standing in the hallway when I looked up. With her arms folded across her chest, she entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a softer tone than earlier, she stated, &#34;You didn&#39;t have to come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back on the chair, I said, &#34;Jack thought I should.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily glared as she approached. &#34;What makes you behave like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Behave like what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a stronger tone now, she answered, &#34;Pretend that none of this matters to you.&#34; &#34;Even though you&#39;re here, you seem so far away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wiped a hand across my face and groaned. &#34;Emily, this is not about me. Your mom- &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my mom,&#34; she cut in. &#34;I am aware of that. I&#39;m not asking that you weep over her. Why do you usually keep people at a distance? Why do you keep me at a distance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed at her, taken aback by her openness. At last, I replied, &#34;You&#39;re reading too much into this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m not.&#34; She took a step toward me and looked into my eyes. Since I moved out, you have been cold. I felt like we were going forward, but now it seems like you&#39;re excluding me once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my jaw. &#34;Some tasks are simpler to complete on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Her voice shook as she pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got up and paced the entire room. &#34;Because I&#39;ve always done it that way, okay? as no one else was present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could stop them, the words fled. Emily&#39;s annoyance gave way to something else as her look softened. &#34;Ethan...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped her by shaking my head. &#34;Emily, I don&#39;t need your sorrow. I&#39;m all right. Simply let it drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not, however, move. &#34;You&#39;re not okay,&#34; she said. And you are no longer need to do this by yourself. I&#39;m yours now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were profound and profound. I thought for a second about lowering my shields a bit. Old habits, however, are hard to break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I answered in a tone that was colder than I meant to: &#34;Thanks, but I&#39;m not your responsibility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily winced, but she kept her eyes fixed on it. Perhaps not. But whether you like it or not, you are now a part of my family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer. Instead, with the walls I had put up around myself still firmly in place, I moved passed her.</p>
