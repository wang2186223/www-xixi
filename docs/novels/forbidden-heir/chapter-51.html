                <p>The room was filled with a harsh glow as the early morning light crept through the blinds. I sat up, my head pounding, and reality struck like a kick to the stomach. No matter how much I wanted them to, the noises, sights, and scents from yesterday night would not go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s voice broke through the mists to say, &#34;Good morning.&#34; He was still seated across from me, looking tired and with his arms crossed. &#34;Dude, you look like hell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a flimsy smile. &#34;Feels like it too.&#34; I rubbed my temples, trying to gather my thoughts. With each recollection, the pictures from yesterday night became more vivid and intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben leaned forward, staring straight ahead. &#34;So... are you going to tell me what&#39;s really going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled deeply because I felt like everything was too heavy. But Ben deserved the truth. If anyone did, it was him. &#34;Ben, I&#39;m in too deep. Too deep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply nodded for me to go on without saying anything. The quiet seemed oppressive, encroaching on every side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Victor introduced me to some people last night,&#34; I said hesitantly, my words trailing off. &#34;Well-known names. Law enforcement, politicians, and those in positions of authority. And their looks were all the same.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s forehead wrinkled. &#34;What sort of looks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I uttered the word &#34;doubt&#34; with difficulty. &#34;As if they don&#39;t believe I&#39;m capable of managing this. As if they&#39;re anticipating my failure. I ran a hand through my hair and chuckled bitterly. They all held my father in high regard. He was one of them, Ben. But me? I am merely an outsider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben shook his head, appearing even more perplexed. &#34;What exactly are you saying, Ethan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the entire weight of the truth bearing down on me, I paused. &#34;Ben, Monroe Enterprises did not exist. Not as we thought. A damn front, that&#39;s what it is. Everything my father constructed served as a front for illicit activities. Money laundering, arms transactions, you name it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s face flashed with shock as his eyes enlarged. &#34;Are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hard gulp, I answered, &#34;Dead serious. And they expect me to continue where he left off now that he&#39;s gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s expression was a mix of shock and betrayal as he took in the information, and the room became silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if you don&#39;t?&#34; At last, he asked in a hushed voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the weight of the decision that wasn&#39;t really a decision at all, I laughed sourly. &#34;I lose everything if I don&#39;t. The money, the connections, the business. And I end up behind bars, penniless and probably with a target on my back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben tightened his jaw. &#34;This is crazy, Ethan. You&#39;re telling me that you&#39;re expected to simply take over your dad&#39;s criminal empire?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;Exactly,&#34; as the truth of it all hit me. &#34;And if I don&#39;t? Victor stated unequivocally that there is no escape. Whether I like it or not, I&#39;m in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben wiped a palm across his face and leaned back. &#34;This is, this is horrible, Ethan. Really bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my wrath erupting, I murmured, &#34;Tell me something I don&#39;t know. Watching them all together last night and listening to their conversation about my father... They were his devoted subjects, and he seemed to be some sort of kingpin. And now they&#39;re looking at me, expecting me to be him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben remained silent, his eyes drooping. &#34;And you didn&#39;t know any of this? Growing up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I answered in a voice that was hardly audible. &#34;He kept everything under wraps. I believed that I was simply creating a legacy by following in his footsteps. But Ben, it&#39;s a terrible nightmare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, we sat in quiet as the gravity of the situation dawned on us. Ben broke the stillness at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, you need to figure out how to get out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no humor about it, but I laughed. &#34;Out? Ben, there&#39;s no escape. That&#39;s the whole point. I&#39;m trapped, just like my father was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice hardened as he stated forcefully, &#34;There&#39;s always a way out. You can&#39;t see it because you&#39;re too close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I averted my gaze as the resentment tore at my chest. &#34;It&#39;s too late, even if there was. Without taking everything away from me and most likely bringing me down with them, they would never let me go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben gave a disbelieving shake of his head. &#34;&#34;And what about Emily? She doesn&#39;t know, does she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said, &#34;No,&#34; as my stomach twisted with remorse. &#34;She doesn&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben rubbed his temples and moaned. &#34;You&#39;re taking her down with you, Ethan. You have to tell her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ben, tell her what? That her father left her a criminal empire? That I have to keep everything going or else I&#39;ll lose everything?&#34; I shook my head, growing increasingly irritated. &#34;It would be better for her not to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben retorted in a firm voice, &#34;She would be better off knowing the truth. Before it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed at him, my eyes displaying my powerlessness. &#34;What comes next? What good would it do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s expression darkened and he fell silent. &#34;At least she&#39;d understand what she&#39;s up against. She is currently in the dark, which is risky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained silent, my thoughts racing with all the secrets I&#39;d kept to myself, all the things that threatened to overwhelm me. &#34;I just I don&#39;t know, Ben. I&#39;m stuck. No matter what I do, someone&#39;s going to get hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben answered steadily, &#34;Then do something that won&#39;t make things worse. Be honest with Emily. If not, at least figure out a means to leave before it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind whirling, I glanced down. It felt like there was no more air in the room, and the truth of my predicament was oppressive. And even though I secretly knew that the walls were closing in, I still wanted to think that there was a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence was broken by Ben&#39;s voice. &#34;Ethan, don&#39;t go this route. Don&#39;t become your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His comments weighed heavily on me, and I swallowed hard. &#34;I have no other option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben shook his head, fury and sympathy mixed in his eyes. &#34;Then, Ethan, make one. Before you lose everything that matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer.</p>
