                <p>The penthouse&#39;s curtains let in the soft morning light, which created a soft glow across the space. With her hair still a little untidy from sleep, Emily sat at the kitchen table and sipped coffee while looking through her phone. We were still tense from last night, so I poured myself a cup and sat across from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a sip and tried to sound nonchalant as I said, &#34;So. Where do we intend to go on vacation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slight smile pulling at her lips, she looked up. &#34;Well, we could do it in the Hamptons or somewhere nearby. But then, I was considering going a little farther away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arched an eyebrow. &#34;More far away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said, tapping her phone, &#34;Yeah. I&#39;m thinking Paris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, I blinked. &#34;Paris? Are you considering traveling all the way to Paris?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily smiled slightly as she shrugged. &#34;Why not? We could use the respite, plus it&#39;s distant away from all this mayhem. Furthermore, I&#39;ve always desired to see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reclined in my chair and thought about it. Paris was a significant step because it was far enough away for us to detach ourselves from all that was going on here. The FBI inquiry, Jack&#39;s mounting skepticism, and Victor&#39;s pressure all felt like a weight bearing down on me. Perhaps Paris was just what we needed. A rest. A new beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and said, &#34;All right. It&#39;s Paris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed Emily relax for the first time in days as her face brightened. &#34;Really? Are you comfortable with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said, attempting to sound casual. &#34;I believe it will benefit us both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see she was relieved as her eyes softened. Although there was still tension between us, perhaps this was a positive move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, we departed the penthouse later that morning and made our way to the workplace to finalize matters before beginning the vacation preparations. I followed Emily closely as we made our way through the crowded streets. After everything that had transpired, I couldn&#39;t get rid of the uneasy feeling that something was hiding in plain sight. However, I made myself ignore those thoughts. This was what I needed. Both of us did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day was well underway by the time we reached Monroe Enterprises. Emily and I entered my office together to find Jack and Ben standing there, both of them looking interested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning,&#34; I said, attempting to sound casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack gave me the same suspicious glance he had been giving me for the past few days as he nodded. Ben nodded slightly to me, but his gaze shifted to Emily as though he was assessing our relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the big news, then?&#34; Ben leaned back against the wall and asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief glance at Emily, I turned to face the guys. &#34;We&#39;re heading to Paris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben raised his eyebrows. &#34;Paris? How long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps a week,&#34; I answered. &#34;I just need to take a short break from all of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s gaze was unreadable as he crossed his arms. &#34;Are you actually heading out at this moment? Considering all that&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at him, well aware of his meaning. &#34;Jack, we need a vacation. We have been under a lot of pressure, as you are aware.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but..&#34; Jack began, but I interrupted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I firmly stated, not wanting to start another debate, &#34;You&#39;re in charge until we get back. This is where you can handle things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Jack&#39;s eyes narrowed a little, he remained calm in front of Emily. &#34;All right,&#34; he sighed. &#34;But when you return, we&#39;re going to need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t miss the warning in his voice, so I nodded. &#34;We are going to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conversely, Ben simply smiled. &#34;Paris, eh? Well, while we&#39;re stuck here, don&#39;t let me stop you from enjoying some wine and pastries at a classy café.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, grateful that he was trying to lighten the mood. &#34;I&#39;ll bring you something nice when I return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben smirked and shot back, &#34;It had better be a damn good souvenir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stress of the day began to wear on Emily and me as we returned to the penthouse after resolving a few more issues at the workplace. I couldn&#39;t resist giving her a sidelong glance while we were walking. It was starting to seem like the proper idea to take her to Paris, far from everything. We were able to breathe once more. Perhaps it would feel normal for once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, that nagging sensation persisted in the back of my mind. The danger we were both in and the secrets I was holding weren&#39;t going away. Additionally, it was becoming more difficult to keep her in the dark the longer we were together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sun started to set outside, we arrived at the penthouse and entered. Through the huge windows, a pleasant glow was cast by the flickering city lights. After throwing her suitcase on the couch, Emily looked at me and looked into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you certain that this is a smart idea?&#34; Her voice was gentle as she requested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to seem more assured than I actually was by nodding. &#34;Yeah. This is necessary. You need this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of hesitation, she smiled. &#34;All right. Here we go, Paris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s voice came back to me as Emily started to head for the bedroom, bringing me back to the present. My phone was buzzing in my pocket as I was ready to follow her. I looked at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is now really the best time for a vacation?&#34; was the message that Jack had sent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question was bothering me, so I hesitated. Was it? Was I merely postponing the inevitable, or would fleeing to Paris change anything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, I ignored their ideas. I wasn&#39;t going to back down now. I promptly responded:  &#34;You&#39;re in charge till I get back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With everything still weighing heavily on me, I followed Emily into the bedroom after putting my phone in my pocket.</p>
