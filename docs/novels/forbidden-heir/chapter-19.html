                <p>I straightened my suit and said &#34;Let&#39;s get this over with,&#34; as I entered the boardroom. The FBI agent&#39;s visit, the bug in my office, and Victor&#39;s threats were still weighing heavily on me. But I wasn&#39;t ready to tell anyone, not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Emily, who was seated at the head of the table next to Jack. I could feel the strain beneath her calm appearance, even though she appeared cool. She put on a brave front, but I could tell she was still getting used to the fact that this wasn&#39;t her world. The fact that several board members obviously weren&#39;t impressed by her attendance didn&#39;t help either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ready for this?&#34; Quietly, I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily&#39;s eyes were steady when she greeted mine. &#34;I have to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack signaled the beginning of the meeting by standing. &#34;We appreciate everyone&#39;s presence today. We&#39;re here to discuss the new roles within Monroe Enterprises. As you know, Emily Clark, Henry&#39;s daughter, has been named a major shareholder, and today we&#39;ll be formally introducing her as a key member of the leadership team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jack spoke, I sensed the tension building in the room. The board members looked at each other, their faces difficult to read, but the conclusion was obvious. Some of them were old-school, loyal to my father&#39;s legacy. Furthermore, it wasn&#39;t ideal with them to bring in a small-town schoolteacher like Emily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An older man with a keen eye reclined back in his chair, one of the board members. &#34;Miss Clark,&#34; he began, his tone polite but laced with condescension, &#34;we&#39;re all very curious to see how someone of your... background will handle the pressures of this company. Teaching children is a completely different world, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were a few giggles in the room. As I saw Emily&#39;s face, I clinched my jaw. I saw her grasp tighten on the chair&#39;s armrest, but she didn&#39;t flinch. I intervened before she could reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her background is irrelevant,&#34; I stated rudely, my voice piercing the room. &#34;What matters is that she&#39;s here now, and she&#39;s part of this company. So if anyone has a problem with that, they should probably reconsider their position on this board.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes turned to me as the room fell silent. I didn&#39;t give a damn. Let them make the judgment. Let them think what they wanted. I refused to allow anyone to degrade her in my presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman sitting close to the center of the board cleared her throat. &#34;Of course, Mr. Monroe. We&#39;re all just... concerned about the transition. Henry established this business with specific values...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a harsh tone, I interrupted, &#34;And those values are still in place. I fully support Emily since she is just as capable as anyone else here. That&#39;s all you need to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily gave me a brief look, her face a mix of surprise and thanks. I nodded subtly to let her know that I was on her side. It was the least I could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack, sensing the tension, quickly steered the meeting back to business. &#34;We need to talk about a few crucial issues pertaining to future developments. We&#39;ll be collaborating closely to make sure the transition goes smoothly when you take on this responsibility, Emily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued to watch the board members as the meeting went on. I wasn&#39;t in the mood for their games today, but their subtle jabs and disapproving looks weren&#39;t missed. I had enough on my plate with Victor hovering over me and the FBI breathing down my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was worn out by the end of the meeting. Mentally, not physically. It was eating away at me to keep everything I knew about Victor, the FBI, and the surveillance hidden. I wanted to warn Emily, but I was reluctant to do so. Not quite yet. She was already overloaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily muttered as we left the conference room, &#34;Thank you for defending me back there. I appreciate it, but I could have handled it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we moved down the hallway, I said quietly, &#34;You don&#39;t have to put up with their shit. I&#39;ll deal with them if they go too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face softened as she looked at me. &#34;You know that you&#39;re not as horrible as you act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a scoff. &#34;Emily, stop thinking I&#39;m a nice guy. I&#39;m not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it didn&#39;t reach her eyes, she smiled. She was obviously still adjusting to everything, including the new responsibilities and the changes. I wasn&#39;t making things any easier by keeping her in the dark, and it was a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dinner tonight?&#34; In an attempt to change the topic, I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of hesitation, Emily nodded. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat at a private restaurant later that night, away from the business and the prying eyes of the media. For a moment, it appeared like we were just two individuals trying to get a handle on the tumultuous condition of our lives, and the discussion was not so heated but rather more easygoing than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Checking out the fancy restaurant, Emily said, &#34;I never thought I&#39;d be in a place like this. It&#39;s so different from Willow Creek. I feel as though I am living the life of someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting a taste of my drink, I answered, &#34;You&#39;ll get used to it.  Have faith me, this world is as bogus as it looks. All you need to do is play the game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily looked into my eyes, looking for anything. To you, is that all this is? A game?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsure of how to respond, I hesitated. Was it a game? Or had I spent so much time stuck in it that I had lost the ability to differentiate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed on the table before I could reply. I felt a cold come over me as I looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t want Emily among the board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Victor who sent the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was unable to breathe for a moment. Since our last &#34;meeting,&#34; Victor had been silent, but I knew better than to assume that he had forgotten. And now he was making demands, demands that targeted Emily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to keep a straight face, I slipped the phone back into my pocket. Emily appeared to be too preoccupied to notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, my thoughts were racing. Since Victor didn&#39;t make empty threats, it was obvious that Emily was in danger if he didn&#39;t want her on the board. Real danger. And I was clueless about how to keep her safe without alerting her to the chaos that was brewing behind the scenes.</p>
