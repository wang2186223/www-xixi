                <p>&#34;Ready to go?&#34; Ethan&#39;s voice broke through the silence of the penthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up from my laptop after quickly checking my emails. Near the door, he stood with his suit jacket hanging loosely on his arm. His calm and confident presence made the morning feel less chaotic than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;ll just get my bag,&#34; I said as I shut my laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, we exited the penthouse and descended to the parking garage. The air between us was pleasant, and after everything that had been going on-at work and in our unusual, confusing living arrangement-it was great to have a moment of calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Busy day today?&#34; Ethan inquired as we went near his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I sighed. &#34;Additional meetings with the board. I&#39;m still not sure if they take me seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They will,&#34; he replied, opening the car door for me. &#34;You&#39;ve already proven yourself more than once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled slightly, grateful for his trust in me. It seemed bizarre how things had changed between us. There had always been tension, but it felt more intense as time passed. Something unspoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as I was getting ready to get in the car, I heard the screeching of tires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could respond, a dark-colored vehicle quickly turned the corner of the garage and drove directly towards us. I felt my heart jump to my throat, causing me to freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emily, please relocate! Ethan spoke with a sense of urgency, his voice powerful and forceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All took place in a flash. I was frozen with fear as I stared at the car, but suddenly Ethan grabbed me and pulled me away. We staggered as one, hitting his car&#39;s side while a fast-moving vehicle narrowly avoided us by a hair&#39;s breadth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise from the car faded away as the vehicle disappeared around the bend, leaving behind only quietness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped suddenly, sensing my heart racing in my chest. I clung to Ethan&#39;s arms firmly, pulling myself near his body. It only took a moment for me to notice that we were both inhaling deeply, still sensing the adrenaline coursing through our veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Ethan&#39;s voice was quiet, but with an edge-as if he was attempting to keep his own panic at bay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...I think so,&#34; I managed to answer, despite my trembling voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s hands stayed on my arms, supporting me. His grip was solid and protective, and for a time, all I could think about was how close his body felt to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That car,&#34; I said, still struggling to regain my breath. &#34;It came out of nowhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Ethan said, his teeth clenched. &#34;Could&#39;ve been an accident, but...&#34; He trailed off, his gaze narrowing toward the direction the car had gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I understood what he was thinking. After everything we&#39;d gone through at Monroe Enterprises-power plays, threats, and secrets-it was difficult not to assume the worst. But right now, I couldn&#39;t concentrate on it. All I could think about was how Ethan had gotten me out of harm&#39;s path and how his hands were still tenderly holding me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I muttered, barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stared down at me, his face softening. &#34;There&#39;s no need for you to thank me. I wasn&#39;t going to allow any harm to come your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words gave me a chill, and after a long time, I finally felt secure. The speed and instinct with which he reacted showed me the depth of his care. It wasn&#39;t only about job or preserving the Monroe heritage. It was something deeper, something that still causes my heart to rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step back, recognizing how close we were together. My hands slid from his arms, but the space between us felt too narrow and electrified. I could still feel the heat on his body and the tension in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I repeated, attempting to shake off the adrenaline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan nodded, but his eyes remained riveted on me. &#34;Good. Let&#39;s head to the office. We&#39;ll chat about the car later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the morning was foggy. I attempted to focus on the meetings, the never-ending paperwork, and discussions about the future of Monroe Enterprises, but I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about that moment in the garage. Ethan pulled me in, and I felt safe and secure in his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was completely foolish. I shouldn&#39;t dwell on him in that way. He was my stepbrother and we collaborated. However, each time I recalled that moment in my mind, I couldn&#39;t help but experience the flutter in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After we completed our last meeting for the day, I felt completely drained, both physically and emotionally. Leaving the boardroom, Ethan matched my pace as we walked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; he asked, speaking softer now that we were alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I responded, even though I wasn&#39;t convinced. &#34;Just tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan looked at me, his expression opaque. &#34;Maybe we should take a break.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked, taken off guard. &#34;A break?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From the company,&#34; he explained. &#34;From everything. We&#39;ve been working ourselves to the ground trying to repair what my father left behind. Maybe we should take a step back, just for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him, astonished by the offer. Ethan was not the sort to abandon duty, even for a day. But when I stared at him, I noticed that the strain in his face and the exhaustion in his eyes mirrored how I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A vacation?&#34; I inquired, lifting an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; Ethan said with a little smile. &#34;It doesn&#39;t need to be long. Only a few days. &#34;Somewhere quiet, away from everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was enticing. The prospect of getting away from the commotion, stress, and pressure of Monroe Businesses seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. However, I wasn&#39;t certain I could retreat, particularly with so many stakes involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I confess nervously, &#34;I have no idea. There&#39;s a great deal of activity happening at the moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Things will always be busy,&#34; Ethan replied. However, you are unable to continue exerting so much pressure on yourself. Both of us require a break. In addition, I think it would be advantageous for both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed at him, attempting to assess his level of seriousness. After reflecting on it, I came to see that he was right. We had been working hard for weeks, barely giving ourselves a break between meetings, discussions, and the constant atmosphere of stress. A getaway might be just what we needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll think about it,&#34; I finally said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan smiled, his eyes warming. &#34;That&#39;s all I ask.&#34;</p>
