                <p>Jack and Ben returned to the room, their faces changing as they noticed how I responded-or didn&#39;t-to Ethan&#39;s abrupt admission. Ben looked at me, his expression a mixture of astonishment and hesitancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan had a look at them and then left us alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben began by saying, &#34;Emily,&#34; as though he was surprised that I hadn&#39;t exploded yet. &#34;I know this is... a lot.&#34; His tone grew softer. &#34;But I&#39;m actually kind of relieved that you&#39;re taking this well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Taking this well?&#34; My jaw tightened. I just gazed at him for a while, calculating the wrath that had begun to well up when I realized how many people had been keeping me in the dark. I spoke carefully so he could hear me all the way through, &#34;Ben, I thought you were my friend. You were aware of everything, and you never considered telling me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flinched, his eyes dropping to the ground, obviously uneasy. &#34;I didn&#39;t make the decision, Emily. Ethan well, he thought it was best. And I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t think it was my place to interfere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath came out sharply. &#34;Not your place to interfere? You witnessed everything, Ben, so how could you even-? You were aware of my confusion and disorientation. You saw me struggle with each clue, and you simply allowed it to happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s shoulders slumped in defeat as he opened his mouth to speak but was only able to sigh. &#34;I know I let you down. But Ethan he thought this would pass. that he was capable of handling things on his own. And I&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is the issue, isn&#39;t it?&#34; I interrupted, raising my voice. &#34;You prioritized Ethan before all else. Above what&#39;s right, even above me. I tried to put my trust in you both during this chaos, but I discovered that you were keeping important details from me the whole time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a practiced lack of interest, Jack had been sitting behind Ethan&#39;s desk, using one hand to browse through his laptop&#39;s emails while using the other to tap a pen on the desk. He was obviously trying to avoid getting involved and appeared more irritated than worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben cried out, losing his concentration, &#34;Jack. Come up here and back me up. You know I didn&#39;t have a choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack gently raised his head, glancing from me to Ben and back. Then he sighed deeply and snapped the laptop shut. He said, picking his words carefully, &#34;Look, Emily. I&#39;ve known Ben a long time. And believe me when I say that Ben is incredibly loyal. I can&#39;t blame him for following Ethan&#39;s instructions, even when they might not have been the best call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mix of disbelief and betrayal, I went to Jack. &#34;What are you saying, then? That loyalty makes it all acceptable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack leaned forward, his eyes keen, and shook his head. &#34;I&#39;m saying Ethan has a way of dragging people along on his terms, and Ben&#39;s loyalty to him is unwavering. It&#39;s not a justification. Emily, I understand why you&#39;re furious.&#34; After running a hand through his hair, he folded his arms and leaned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But,&#34; he continued, &#34;if Ben didn&#39;t tell you, it&#39;s not because he wanted to deceive you. He is simply, like the rest of us, trapped in the middle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben ran a hand through his hair and sighed. &#34;Emily, I sincerely apologize. I know I messed up. I didn&#39;t wish to cause you any harm. Ethan has been in a challenging situation. We both believed that keeping you out of it would keep you safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep me safe?&#34; I said it again, my tone brimming with irony. &#34;You believed that keeping me in the dark would protect me? How did that ever make sense?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flinched. &#34;It&#39;s not logical, I know. But it felt like less of a risk at the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms and sighed in frustration. &#34;You and Ethan are so preoccupied with defending one another that you fail to consider the people you are genuinely harming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though he had heard enough, Jack leaned back and took out his phone, looking partly bored as he browsed through his emails. Ben gave him a helpless look as he attempted to get Jack to rejoin the conversation in the hopes that he would say something to defuse the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben begged, &#34;Help me out here, Jack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack tapped his phone lightly against the desk and looked up. &#34;Emily, believe me, if you think it&#39;s hard dealing with Ethan now, you should&#39;ve known him back when he started running Monroe Enterprises with Henry. The secrets, the back-door deals Ethan was never considered a son by Henry, but rather a business partner. Ethan believes that he is acting in the same way as his father would have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that justifies deceiving me?&#34; I fired back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack scowled, obviously annoyed by the whole thing. &#34;No, that doesn&#39;t justify it. I also informed Ethan that he needed to be open and honest with you. But he&#39;s not going to change overnight. Ever since he took over Monroe Enterprises, he has been living in survival mode. He isn&#39;t accustomed to letting people in, particularly those he cares about.&#34; Jack&#39;s tone became more serious as his voice grew a little softer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben gave me a serious look as he glanced at me. &#34;If I could go back in time and change anything, I would, Emily. It wasn&#39;t until now that I realized how incorrect it was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And, honestly, Emily, we&#39;re running out of time to fight over it,&#34; Jack continued. We&#39;re all in the middle of this investigation. The shadow of Victor Alvarez hangs over everything, and the FBI isn&#39;t giving up either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a breath and felt my shoulders sink. &#34;And Richards?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack smiled just a little. &#34; Remember I filed a restraining order against him on your behalf. He won&#39;t be able to harass you directly for a while. But we still need to be careful about what we say and do. He is unrelenting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked from Jack to Ben and arched an eyebrow. &#34;So, you two don&#39;t mind getting sucked into whatever Ethan is doing right now? Whatever plan he has?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben looked at him and shrugged. &#34;We&#39;re all in too deep to turn back now, Emily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened before I could reply, and Ethan returned with a confident but enigmatic smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked from me to Ben and Jack and said, &#34;Are we done?&#34; as though he was challenging us to ask him more questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence in the room. Jack and Ben were waiting, just as eager as I was for a response, but I wasn&#39;t sure whether he would provide it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack said, his voice harsh but controlled, &#34;Ethan, you can&#39;t just walk out in the middle of a conversation like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan answered, avoiding eye contact, &#34;I know. But I needed to make sure of something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s face became stern. He turned to Jack and Ben after giving me another look. &#34;You don&#39;t need to worry about Richards for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His speech carried a finality that left us all silent and staring at each other with obvious bewilderment as the words lingered in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack and I exchanged a glance of instant worry, and Ben, who had just become motionless, jerked to his feet. &#34;Ethan, what did you do?&#34;</p>
