                <p>&#34;Gosh!&#34; I slammed the paperwork onto my desk, and the phrase burst out of my mouth. The pages were spread everywhere, taunting me with their uselessness. I had believed the sting operation had been perfect. Planning, monitoring, and meticulous planning had all been reduced to dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the metal legs of my chair scraping on the floor, I pulled it back and paced the small space. The workplace smelled of sadness and stale coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How on earth were they aware?&#34; My hands clenched and unclenched as I murmured. Someone had told them. There was no other reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fluorescent lights in the hallway buzzed like a swarm of flies as I grabbed my coat and rushed out. The icy cold of the night seemed to sink into my bones as I walked to my car, which was parked at the far end of the lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben Fisher. Like a warning light, his face flashed in my mind. He had been helpful-too helpful. The engine roared to life as I jammed the key into the ignition and sped toward his house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s neighborhood was as unremarkable as they come, with rows of similar homes, immaculate lawns, and porch lights that glowed like broken promises. The dirt crunched beneath my boots as I turned off the engine and stepped outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a fit of anger, I rang the doorbell. The door opened a moment later, and Ben stood there, looking both shocked and cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the doorframe and whispered, &#34;Agent Richards. It&#39;s late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I retorted, &#34;When months of work and millions of dollars are destroyed, tardiness is not a problem. Fisher, I need answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben sighed and moved aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His home&#39;s exterior was as well-maintained as its interior. Too neat, too perfect. It made me tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked, &#34;Whiskey?&#34; and went to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed him and said, &#34;Just answers. How were they aware of the operation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a glass already in hand, Ben turned. &#34;I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step forward and dropped my voice. &#34;Don&#39;t act stupid, Fisher. They were warned by someone. You&#39;ve known Monroe for a long time. Don&#39;t act like you know nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His calm attitude infuriated me as he sipped his drink. &#34;I would let you know if I knew anything. But I don&#39;t. Perhaps you should ask your own team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yelled, &#34;My team isn&#39;t the one with ties to a criminal empire. I supported you, Fisher. If you&#39;re cheating me-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a serious voice, he interrupted, &#34;Watch it. I&#39;ve gone above and beyond to help you. Don&#39;t blame me because your plan failed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like static energy, the tension between us crackled. I looked down at him, looking for a weakness in his facade, but he refused to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I took a step back. &#34;All right,&#34; I replied coldly. &#34;But I&#39;ll bury you if I find out you&#39;re lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Streetlights and increasing annoyance filled the drive back to the office. After Ben&#39;s denial, I had more questions than answers, and I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that he was hiding something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The building was extremely quiet when I arrived. I walked to my office, my footsteps echoing in the deserted halls. My discomfort deepened with the harsh shadows cast by the fluorescent lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed just as I was settled in. My guts dropped when I saw the number on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Richards,&#34; I said, keeping a calm tone despite the dread gnawing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The terse response was, &#34;Report to Conference Room B immediately.&#34; The line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like a death march as I made my way to the meeting room. Three top agents were already seated when I entered, their faces unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man in the middle motioned for me to sit and said, &#34;Agent Richards.&#34; Director Callahan was written on his nameplate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands were sweating as I sat down. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his hands clasped on the table, Callahan leaned forward. &#34;Your recent operation-and its failure-needs to be discussed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat up straight. &#34;Respectfully, sir, the plan was ruined. A tip was given to the targets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re concerned about,&#34; Callahan said in a cold voice. &#34;There is evidence that the leak might have come from people in your social circle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The charge hit me like a punch to the gut. &#34;Do you mean that I-?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another agent stopped me with a sharp look. &#34;No one&#39;s suggesting anything. But we must consider all options.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned forward and spoke strongly. &#34;I&#39;ve given everything to this case. I didn&#39;t cause the leak, if there even was one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was silent as Callahan raised his hand. &#34;Debating isn&#39;t our goal. Our goal is to assess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The third agent, a reserved man with a sharp look, pushed a file across the table, and the room went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what this is?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blood froze as I opened the file and looked through its contents. It held details about the operation that I hadn&#39;t shared with anyone outside of my small team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you get this?&#34; I insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callahan&#39;s face became stern. &#34;That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to determine. This document was found in the custody of a known informant linked to Monroe Enterprises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the air like a death sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not possible,&#34; I mumbled, barely whispering. &#34;I didn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp agent halted. &#34;We&#39;ve also heard rumors that you&#39;ve been making unauthorized trips to a certain Ben Fisher. Would you care to explain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my hands. &#34;Fisher is an important resource. He&#39;s cooperated-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said, &#34;Or he&#39;s been giving you false information. And your grudge has blinded you to see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot back, raising my voice, &#34;This isn&#39;t about a grudge. Justice is at stake here. Fisher is our best chance to take down Monroe Enterprises, which is a cancer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callahan&#39;s eyes were tired as he leaned back. &#34;Richards, I admire your passion. But unchecked emotion can be dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his hand as I opened my mouth to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re suspended, effective immediately,&#34; he said in a firm tone. &#34;You must turn in your badge and weapon until we can assess the full scope of this breach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit me like a physical blow. I trembled as I answered, &#34;You can&#39;t be serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Callahan said, &#34;This isn&#39;t a punishment,&#34; though his tone suggested otherwise. &#34;It&#39;s a safety measure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my pistol and badge on the table and reluctantly reached for my jacket. The act felt devastating in its weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up to leave, but Callahan&#39;s voice stopped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One last thing,&#34; he said. &#34;If we find proof that you were involved in this leak, you won&#39;t just lose your job. You&#39;ll be charged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I left, the room spun around me, and the door slammed shut behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold night air stung my skin as the parking lot stood empty. I sat in my car, holding the steering wheel, replaying the events of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was accused of being the leak. I was suddenly facing resistance from the very people I trusted to support me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quietly vowed to prove them wrong as the engine roared to life, no matter the cost.</p>
