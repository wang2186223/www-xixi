                <p>&#34;Fisher, you&#39;re stalling.&#34; With every word tinged with annoyance, Agent Richards&#39; voice crackled over the burner phone. I could see him leaning on a plain desk in his clean office, his eyes narrowing, his mouth stretching. I always felt like a chess piece sitting on the edge of the board when I was around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I answered, my voice just above a whisper, &#34;I&#39;m trying.&#34; The faint lamplight in my living room did little to dispel the thick shadows that spread across the walls. &#34;However, Ethan is tough to trust. You are aware of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be vague with me, Fisher. I&#39;ve given you enough time. I require brains. Real data. Not your flimsy reasons.&#34; Richards&#39; tone became more abrasive, piercing the thin layer of decorum he had been holding to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squeezed the phone until my fingers were white. I hated this. Even though I hadn&#39;t offered Ethan anything important, every word I said to Richards seemed like a betrayal and a stab in his back. At least not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you aware of the stakes involved?&#34; Richards continued, his voice low and angry now. &#34;Ethan becomes more and more entangled in Victor Alvarez&#39;s web the longer you drag your feet. You also go down with him if he does. Is that your preference?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a worried breath, I closed my eyes. The air was oppressively heavy. The only thing keeping me grounded was the gentle hum of the refrigerator in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the words tasted like ash on my lips, I managed to say, &#34;I&#39;ll get you something soon. Give me a little more time, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More ominous than Richards&#39; comments was his silence on the other end. His voice was icy when he finally spoke. &#34;You have a week. I won&#39;t be able to use you after that.&#34; The line died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw stubble scratched across my palms as I rubbed my face with both hands after dropping the phone onto the coffee table. I couldn&#39;t deny the physical aching that the talk had put in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked out of my trance by the knock on the door. Because of the remaining stress from Richards&#39; call, every sound seemed dangerous, and my pulse leaped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ben? It&#39;s me,&#34; Sophie spoke in a strong but gentle tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts were racing, so I paused before replying. What if she was aware? What if she could see my face, every line etched with guilt? Sophie was persistent, though, and before I could gather myself, there was another knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was standing there as I opened the door, her face showing a combination of resolve and worry. She wore pants and a basic sweatshirt, and her hair was pulled back into a loose ponytail. She seemed to be at the middle of a storm, but there was also something calming about her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remarked, &#34;You look like hell,&#34; and entered without waiting for an offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mumbled, &#34;Thanks,&#34; and shut the door after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze swept over my face as if she could read every thought running through my mind as she turned to face me. &#34;What&#39;s happening, Ben? Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s nothing, either. You have been missing for weeks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went past her on my way to the kitchen. &#34;Just work-related stuff. You are aware of the situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t,&#34; she answered firmly. &#34;Don&#39;t ignore me. Because I care about you, I&#39;m here. You can tell me what it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layers of my defenses were peeled away by her comments. But how could I be honest with her? That I was torn between the demands of a federal inquiry and my pledge to my best friend? That every choice I made was like standing on a precipice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cool water didn&#39;t do much to quench the fire in my chest, so I poured myself a glass. &#34;Thank you, Sophie. I do. However, I am unable to share this at this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put a hand on my arm as she crossed the room. &#34;You know, you don&#39;t have to bear everything alone. You don&#39;t have to deal with this alone, whatever it may be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my resolution crumbling, I turned to face her. Her genuine look disarmed me, and for a split second, I allowed myself to think that perhaps, just possibly, I wasn&#39;t alone in this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered myself and kissed her before I could stop myself. Without hesitation, she replied, bringing her hands up to cup my face. The kiss was desperate, a flurry of feelings that I was unable to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trails of fire followed as her fingers moved down my back. I felt the warmth of her skin against mine as my hands sought her waist and drew her closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes blazed with fire as she broke away from the kiss, breathless and longing for more. She took hold of my shirt and pulled it over my head, showing me to her curious eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sent chills down my spine as she ran her fingers over the curves of my chest. I did the same, reverently examining the gentle curves of her body and feeling the quick rise and fall of her breath as our passion intensified. We made a quiet call for more as our eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly raised her onto the bed, our bodies intertwined like two parts of a single thing. I gazed into her eyes as she straddled me, viewing the reflection of our mutual hunger. I growled softly and reached up to remove her shirt, revealing her beautiful body underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a renewed passion that made my blood boil, she bent down to give me another kiss. Her tongue darted in and out as though trying to take a piece of my soul, and her lips were moist and warm against mine. I gave the same response, and we engaged in a furious battle for dominance, our tongues slicing like swords.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swayed above me, her moves captivating me with their rhythm. Feeling every curve and inch of her that was mine to explore, my hands moved over her skin. As she rode my aching erection, she rocked her hips slowly and groaned quietly against my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arched her back in reply as my fingers moved down her spine. I seized her by the hips and drew her in, thrusting upwards with a sudden desire. Our groans blended into a symphony of pleasure as our bodies collided in an intense dance of lust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached down to take control and bit my lip. She guided herself onto me, daring me to look away as our eyes met. With one more push, the intensity of our love enveloped us both, and we were lost in the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our bodies moved in unison, fitting into each other&#39;s hug like two parts of a puzzle. I never got tired of feeling the gentle curves that were now mine as my hands moved over her body. We got closer to the edge with each touch, kiss, and groan until we were unable to control ourselves any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our cries drowned out the clamor of pleasure as our bodies trembled in sync as we reached our peak. As our hearts beat in perfect unison, we rode the waves of happiness together, and time seemed to stop. When it was finally finished, we lay together on the bed, tired and drenched in sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathless and content, we gazed into each other&#39;s eyes, knowing that this moment would live on in our minds forever. A tribute to the deep feeling that had initially drawn us together, it was a night that neither of us would ever forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know,&#34; she said, &#34;you&#39;re going to be fine. We&#39;ll beat it together, no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my throat and swallowed hard. &#34;Sophie, you shouldn&#39;t have to put up with my worries. You deserve better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was hard as she raised her head to look at me. &#34;Don&#39;t say that. I&#39;m here because I want to be. Ben, you&#39;re not alone in this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her comments soothed my tense nerves, but they didn&#39;t change the truth of my situation. Would she still give me the same look if she knew the truth? Would she still wish to be at my side and follow me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in my Monroe Enterprises office the next morning, looking at the spreadsheet on my screen without really seeing anything. Each thought pulled me in a different way, and my mind was a tornado of opposing feelings.</p>
