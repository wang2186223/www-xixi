                <p>I was both relieved and uneasy as Sophie and I walked into the new flat. Despite its beauty, the location served as a reminder of the reality I was returning to. The sleek furnishings and marble worktops give the entire space a shiny, almost menacing edge, and the floor-to-ceiling windows allow in an abundance of city lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie looked about with wide eyes and whistled softly. &#34;This place is something, Em. Wow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to chuckle, but my voice was wobbly because it was nothing new to me. &#34;Yeah. It&#39;s definitely not Willow Creek.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie strolled to the living room and rubbed the edge of a glass coffee table with her fingers. &#34;I feel like I&#39;m in one of those luxury magazines. The ones that tell you that a pillow costs a thousand dollars, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped my luggage beside the entrance and remarked, &#34;Probably because it does.&#34; I could still feel the tension from seeing Richards, and I know Sophie could too. It hung over me like a black cloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile faded as she turned to face me. &#34;How are you, Emily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a big breath and nodded. &#34;I am. It&#39;s just everything&#39;s different here. This apartment is just too much to handle, and Richards is the first person back in New York. It just doesn&#39;t feel right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached and placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. &#34;Well, this time you&#39;re not by yourself. And I&#39;ve got your back if something goes wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sincere smile appeared on my face. &#34;Thank you, Soph. Really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked to the couch and smiled. &#34;All right, enough of the in-depth discussions. Let&#39;s get that couch out and throw a traditional overnight at Willow Creek. blankets, movies, and snacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and couldn&#39;t help but giggle as I picked up a few pillows. Trying to lose ourselves in a little lighthearted fun, we sat down on the couch and shared a blanket while watching a romantic comedy. The jokes and laughter eased the stress, and before I knew it, Sophie had nestled up next to me as I fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brilliant city light coming in through the windows woke me up the following morning. I looked around and blinked, stretched. Sophie had a satisfied smile on her face and was still sound asleep. I gave her a gentle shoulder shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Soph. Get up. We&#39;ve got to head over to Jack&#39;s office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five more minutes,&#34; she muttered as she awoke, but then she sat up and rubbed her eyes. &#34;All right, all right. Let&#39;s get started go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we eventually got up, we stretched, showered, and changed into our clothing. On the way to Wentworth and Miller, we stopped for coffee. With its glass exterior reflecting the morning sun in a blinding gleam, the office building towered above the ground. Sophie&#39;s face was a mixture of wonder and anxiety as she gazed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This place looks like it belongs in a movie,&#34; she whispered, holding on to her coffee cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we entered the gleaming lobby and passed through the rotating doors, I nodded, experiencing a twinge of recognition. The receptionist knew me right away and showed us to the upper floor, where Jack&#39;s office was located. I sensed Sophie&#39;s enthusiasm and curiosity as we ascended in the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie muttered, &#34;So this is where the letter came from?&#34; as we left the room and proceeded down the corridor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I said, looking at her. &#34;And this is when it all changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived at Jack&#39;s office, his assistant nodded courteously and motioned for us to come in. Jack was already inside, looking through some files at his desk. When we entered, he looked up with a kind but restrained smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood to shake my hand and said, &#34;Emily. &#34;And you must be Sophie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie grasped his hand and nodded, her eyes enlarging. &#34;Yeah. I&#39;m glad to have finally met you. Jack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack turned back to me after giving her a courteous grin. &#34;Emily, I&#39;m glad you came, but I wasn&#39;t expecting you to return so quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled back, but I could feel a humming nervousness inside of me. &#34;A lot needs to be settled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After giving Sophie a quick glance and nodding, Jack cleared his throat. &#34;I do have some case updates, but, uh. He trailed off while glancing uncertainly at Sophie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Sophie saw the indication, she raised her hands. &#34;Oh, I am okay. I am merely providing moral support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack laughed, but there was a glimmer of unease in his eyes. &#34;Thank you for that. But there are some specifics that I would rather not discuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie&#39;s expression lowered slightly, and I reassured her by patting her shoulder. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Soph. Give us a minute, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Jack a fleeting smile as she nodded. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m going to just be outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went back to Jack as she walked away, and we began to take each other seriously. &#34;All right, Jack. What is happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack ran a hand through his hair and sighed. &#34;I must tell you the truth, Emily. It appears that things are more complicated than I had thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his voice and leaned forward. &#34;The more I investigate your father&#39;s activities, the more disturbing things I discover. Furthermore, with Agent Richards pursuing us, the situation will eventually come to a head. And everyone is aware of the foundation upon which this business is truly based.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot of coldness formed in my stomach as I swallowed hard. &#34;Jack, what are you saying exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office door creaked open before he could respond, and we both turned to see Sophie looking in. &#34;Sorry to interrupt, but&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was not alone in the doorway. Ethan was standing behind her, his towering body taking up the room, his face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he entered, a tight stillness descended upon the room, his eyes darting between Jack and me.</p>
