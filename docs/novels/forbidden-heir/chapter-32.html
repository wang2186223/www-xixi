                <p>&#34;Are you sure you&#39;re okay?&#34; As I leaned against the kitchen counter and watched Ethan grab his jacket, I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m fine.&#34; His tone was distant and flat. He didn&#39;t even give me a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been giving me the same spiel for days. One-word answers, fake grins, no genuine interaction, no eye contact. I sensed that something was wrong, more than usual, in every chilly encounter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an attempt to encourage him to talk, I pushed, &#34;You&#39;re barely around anymore. And you&#39;re... somewhere else when you&#39;re.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, Ethan turned to look at me. &#34;It&#39;s just work, Emily. Right now, I have a lot going on, and I don&#39;t have time to deal with-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With what?&#34; My irritation boiled to the surface and I interrupted. &#34;Me? Is that it? Do you not have time to deal with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was obviously annoyed as he combed his hair. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what were you trying to say?&#34; I fired back. Heavy and tense, the words hovered between us. Ethan, however, remained silent. Without saying another word, he simply picked up his keys and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he left, I stood there for a while, feeling sad. Now it was always like way-secrets, closed doors, half-talk. No matter how hard I tried, I was unable to determine what was causing him to pull away more and more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to think he was real. I secretly knew there was more to it, but I wanted to believe it was simply work and stress. I was going wild because of the way he looked at me, as if he was holding something back. I wasn&#39;t sure I could handle it any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Ethan was already locked in his office when I arrived. I chose to immerse myself in my job rather to peer at him through the glass wall. I might be able to avoid thinking about how strange things had become between us if I kept myself occupied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But of course, the universe had other plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice I recognized murmured, &#34;Miss Clark,&#34; jolting me out of my reverie. FBI Agent Richards was standing in front of my desk when I looked up, looking as arrogant and unwanted as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced a smile as I got to my feet and said, &#34;Agent Richards. How may I help you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He presented a file. &#34;I am merely reminding you that the investigation is still in progress. I felt some recent developments might be of interest to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tensed up. &#34;As I previously stated, I am not aware of any unlawful activity at Monroe Enterprises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards grinned. &#34;Obviously. However, such inquiries can become... complex. There are instances when people are engaged in activities they are unaware of. Miss Clark, I would hate for you to experience it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his words took hold, my heart began to accelerate. Was there a danger there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I firmly stated, &#34;I&#39;m not involved in anything. And you should ask Ethan any questions you may have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards answered with a smile that never wavered, &#34;Mr. Monroe hasn&#39;t been exactly open. Don&#39;t worry, though. We&#39;re monitoring the situation. We usually do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His final remarks hung in the air like a black fog as he handed me his card and turned to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had trouble concentrating the remainder of the day. Not with Ethan acting as if I didn&#39;t exist and the FBI breathing down our necks. I was starting to believe that I was the only one who cared about the problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that afternoon, I was cleaning my desk when I saw that Ethan&#39;s office door was open. He had left his office unoccupied to attend a conference. Ordinarily, I wouldn&#39;t have given it much thought, but I felt a pull that I couldn&#39;t get rid of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After checking to make sure no one was looking, I went to his office and entered. Documents and folders littered his desk, along with papers. I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what he had been working on so relentlessly lately because it was a mess, more than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t snooping. Not at all. All I wanted was answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was going through the paperwork when I noticed a document hidden behind a pile of files. As I scanned the header, I furrowed my brow and saw that it said, Monroe Enterprises - Shipment Approval. But there was a problem. The specifications of the package, the language-this was not your typical business transaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weapons. Weapons were listed in the document.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I quickly perused the documentation and realized this was no ordinary package, my heart began to accelerate. It was something more serious, something against the law. However, why did Ethan possess it? Why was it hidden beneath so much paperwork?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard footsteps before I had time to take it all in. Ethan entered the room as I pushed the document back into the stack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at the documents I was holding and narrowed his eyes, asking, &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to maintain my composure as I mumbled, &#34;I was... just looking for something. You didn&#39;t close the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s look changed to one of caution and tension as his eyes strayed to the papers in my hands. &#34;Did you find what you were searching for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my heart racing, I held out the document I had discovered. &#34;This. What is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave the paper a quick inspection before putting his mask back on. &#34;It&#39;s just part of the paperwork. I haven&#39;t had time to review everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Part of the paperwork?&#34; My voice rose in annoyance as I repeated. &#34;This is a shipment of weapons, Ethan. Illegal weapons. Why do you own this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s mouth clenched. &#34;As I previously mentioned, I haven&#39;t had time to go over anything. Most likely, it was simply mixed in with the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mixed in? Was that his justification? It was unbelievable to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I&#39;ll believe that?&#34; I lost my temper. &#34;Ethan, this isn&#39;t a small error. This is a severe matter. And you&#39;re dismissing it as though it doesn&#39;t exist?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a quick, obviously annoyed sigh. &#34;I have a lot on my plate right now, Emily. I don&#39;t have time to go over everything with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger tightened my chest as I gazed at him. &#34;Aren&#39;t you keeping something from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer. His expression was impenetrable as he simply gazed at me. And all I needed was that stillness, that inability to answer any questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was heavy with bewilderment and frustration as I left Ethan&#39;s office. No matter how hard I tried, he refused to let me in because he was harboring secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The document was still fresh in my thoughts when I went back to my work. What did Ethan get up to? And why would he want to keep me out so badly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever was happening, one thing was certain: it wasn&#39;t good. And I was beginning to question whether I could still trust him.</p>
