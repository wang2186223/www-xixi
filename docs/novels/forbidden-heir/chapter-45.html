                <p>The familiar warmth of Sophie&#39;s home calmed my rushing thoughts as we sat together in her comfortable living room, and I felt lighter. The solace of Willow Creek was a welcome change from the tension that had been rising in New York. Nevertheless, I could sense Sophie watching me, waiting for me to reveal the truth that I had been holding inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie began, &#34;So New York,&#34; in a quiet but inquisitive tone. &#34;How does life feel in that world?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my hands on my lap and mustered a tiny grin. &#34;It&#39;s... intense. Totally different. Strict timetables, large workplaces, and constantly rushing people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie looked at me and nodded. &#34;And you&#39;re actually involved now, aren&#39;t you? Running alongside businesspeople and billionaires?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I said, in a slightly too-false tone. I understood that I must appear different to her. &#34;Soph, it&#39;s overwhelming. I feel like I don&#39;t belong there sometimes. As if I&#39;m simply... lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put a hand on mine and gave it a light squeeze. &#34;Well, don&#39;t let it consume you completely. Don&#39;t allow them cause you to lose who you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words grounded me, and I nodded, but I felt a chill go through me. I didn&#39;t have to explain that Ethan&#39;s secrets had begun to feel like mine, and that I was on the verge of losing myself. The nagging suspicion that he was concealing something enormous plagued me all the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, how are things between you and Ethan?&#34; Sophie inquired in a tone that was both interested and worried. &#34;Are the two of you together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made myself turn away as my heart skipped a beat. &#34;What do you two mean? It&#39;s difficult Soph&#34; I murmured, my voice barely above a whisper. &#34;We&#39;re close. Though it feels like there is a wall separating us, we are closer than I anticipated. He simply retreats whenever I attempt to understand him. And I&#39;m not sure why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie&#39;s eyes softened and she remained mute. &#34;Em, perhaps he&#39;s hiding something. Maybe he isn&#39;t prepared to tell you everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her remarks resonated too deeply with me, reflecting the persistent sensation that had been bothering me for weeks. But my phone rang before I could answer. My gut knotted as the well-known number appeared on the screen. Agent Richards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need to get that?&#34; Sophie looked at the phone and inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it is really pretty important,&#34; I said, getting to my feet and heading for the window. I inhaled deeply to regain my composure before responding. &#34;Agent Richards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily,&#34; he said in a direct and piercing voice, as though he had been anticipating this call. &#34;I just wanted to say hello. Check to see whether you&#39;ve got a chance to think about our conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away, lowering my voice as I looked at Sophie, who was watching me from the couch with a worried look on her face. &#34;As I previously stated, Agent Richards, I am unsure of my level of assistance. About Monroe Enterprises, I know very little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He softened his tone but added a sense of urgency that made me shudder. &#34;Emily,&#34; he whispered, &#34;you&#39;re underestimating your position. You&#39;re on the board. You have access to everything that goes on there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling protective, I fired back, &#34;But I&#39;m not involved in any of it. I asked for none of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards exhaled deeply. &#34;Maybe not, but you&#39;re tied to it now, whether you like it or not. Emily, this isn&#39;t about what you wanted. It has to do with your location. And right now, that&#39;s in the middle of something much bigger than you realize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of frustration swept over me. &#34;You make it sound like I&#39;m guilty of something just by being there. I didn&#39;t do anything incorrectly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The law doesn&#39;t see it that way,&#34; he calmly retorted. &#34;Because of your affiliation with Monroe Enterprises, you are also implicated if the business is. That is simply the truth of your circumstances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hung over me like a thick blanket, oppressive and unrelenting. I just stood there in quiet, clutching the phone as though it were an anchor, unsure of how to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re involved, Emily,&#34; Richards added, his tone becoming more acerbic. &#34;You&#39;re involved in this whether you want to be or not. And if Monroe Enterprises goes down, you&#39;re going down with it. Consider the implications of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was racing, and I could feel dread beginning to set in. &#34;So, Agent Richards, what are you saying? That I should just abandon Ethan and Monroe Enterprises?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a moment to process what he had said. &#34;I&#39;m suggesting that it will be more difficult to escape the deeper you go. Emily, you have an option. You could protect yourself from any repercussions and assist us in constructing a case. Or you can stay loyal to Ethan and take on the risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling stuck, I stumbled, &#34;I I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t just betray him, and I don&#39;t know anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richards responded, &#34;Loyalty won&#39;t protect you if Monroe Enterprises collapses, even though you might not see it that way now. Emily, consider your future. Consider what is at risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there with a sad heart and a thousand ideas running through my head when the connection became silent and I realized he had hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked back to Sophie, who was frowning at me. &#34;Is everything alright?&#34; she inquired softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it didn&#39;t reach my eyes, but I faked a tiny smile. &#34;Just a little more complicated. It&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out and pulled me into an embrace as if sensing my hesitancy. &#34;Remember who you are, Em. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on. Don&#39;t allow them to drag you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words lingered, a reminder of who I was, who I wanted to be. But as I left Sophie&#39;s house and made my way back home, Agent Richards&#39;s warning echoed in my mind, louder than anything else.</p>
