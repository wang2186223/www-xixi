                <p>Ben replied, leaning against my office doorway and wearing the same sly expression, &#34;You&#39;re doing it again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too busy staring at my laptop to look up. &#34;What am I doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;pushing her out of the way. pretending that everything is alright when it isn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strain in my mind was rising like a ticking time bomb, so I stroked my temples. &#34;It&#39;s not all about Emily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben snorted and moved farther into the space. &#34;Are you certain about that? Because all I&#39;ve witnessed over the past two weeks is you pouting and yelling at anyone who brings up her name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so frustrated that I slammed the laptop shut. &#34;Ben, what are you hoping I&#39;ll say? That I&#39;m slipping away? That the FBI is close in and Victor is breathing down my neck? That I no longer know what to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arms were folded and his face was softer than normal as he leaned against my desk. &#34;Yes, in fact. I want you to say just that. It would at least be truthful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp exhale, I combed through my hair. &#34;Victor doesn&#39;t trust her. He&#39;s pushing harder every day, demanding I cut her out. The FBI is on us, and they are now returning to the office. They&#39;re most likely sniffing about her as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben furrowed his brows. &#34;You believe she will betray you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though I didn&#39;t want to, uncertainty was racing through my head. Richards had made multiple appearances, and I sensed Emily&#39;s retreat, just as I was retreating from her. The thought of her caving in to the pressure was gnawing at me, even though it wasn&#39;t her fault-I was the one withholding information from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back in my chair and mutely murmured, &#34;I don&#39;t know. This is bigger than any of us, but I&#39;m trying to protect her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben remained silent for a while, looking at my face as if he was unsure of what to say next. &#34;Ethan, Victor has you in a tight spot. But excluding Emily? That isn&#39;t the solution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You believe I&#39;m unaware of that?&#34; I got up from my desk and snapped. &#34;But Victor will decide for me if I can&#39;t figure this out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben shook his head and moaned. &#34;You have a tightrope to walk. Don&#39;t fall off and drag her down with you, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed like the day went on forever. Not a single phone call or meeting mattered. My thoughts were elsewhere. I could feel the gap widening between us every time Emily passed my office or we looked at each other across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to share everything with her. I wanted to take her aside and tell her what I was going through and what I was actually attempting to shield her from. But as soon as I began to consider it, my only thought was of her rushing to the FBI and telling them everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was unable to truly trust anyone. Not even her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, after the office had emptied I sat at my desk, a stack of documents spread out in front of me. I needed to learn more about Victor&#39;s activities, but my focus was off. I couldn&#39;t depend on him indefinitely, and I wasn&#39;t going to give him any more control over my life than he already had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long before I took over, Victor had been managing these arms sales through Monroe Enterprises for years. It was my responsibility now, but my father had been clever enough to hide his tracks. Without going to jail or worse, I had to figure out how to get ahead of Victor and stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I scrolled through encrypted emails and financial reports, I kept thinking about Emily. She had given me a puzzled, distrustful, and hurt expression earlier. I couldn&#39;t let her in, even though it hurt me to watch her like that. Not right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buzzing of my phone snapped me out of my thoughts. I expected to see another standard business email when I looked at the screen, but when I saw the name, my stomach turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the message after a brief moment of hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She needs to leave Monroe Enterprises. I don&#39;t trust her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stared at the words, my blood froze. With my head racing, I clenched my phone. Victor didn&#39;t trust her, of course. He had no faith in anyone. However, this-this was different. Emily was being singled out by him, which could only indicate that he was starting to view her as a liability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite my best efforts to keep her out of this situation, Victor now had her in his sights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had trouble concentrating the following morning. I had spent the night at work. I kept thinking about Victor&#39;s message, and the tension between Emily and I was getting worse. She attempted to speak with me once more on the document she discovered and Richards&#39; visits, but I cut her off. The expression in her eyes told me she didn&#39;t believe a word I told her, even if it was nothing more than outdated documentation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t tell her. I was unable to let her in. But I wasn&#39;t sure how long I could maintain the act now that Victor was insisting that I fire her from the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to keep my brain clear as I began the day&#39;s duties, but I always felt guilty when I saw Emily at her desk. She was already too deeply involved in this catastrophe, regardless of my best efforts to shield her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben came into my office and said, &#34;Hey,&#34; jolting me out of my reverie. &#34;You look like you haven&#39;t slept.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mumbled, looking up from my desk, &#34;Didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben studied me for a moment, then folded his arms. &#34;I&#39;m guessing this isn&#39;t just about the FBI anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, I combed through my hair. &#34;Victor sent another message. He wants Emily out of Monroe Enterprises. Says he doesn&#39;t trust her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben&#39;s face grew serious. &#34;So, what will you do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said in a hushed voice, &#34;I don&#39;t know. But Victor will decide for me if I don&#39;t take action soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ben gave me a long look before continuing. &#34;Ethan, you must overcome this. before things get out of hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I mumbled, still in shock as I looked at the papers on my desk. &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
