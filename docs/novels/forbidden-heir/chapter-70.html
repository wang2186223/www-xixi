                <p>&#34;Are we sure about this?&#34; Sophie asked as we packed up our hotel room the next morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a quick look at her. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Going back to New York like nothing&#39;s wrong,&#34; she answered, folding a sweater with unnecessary force. &#34;Leaving your mom here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have a choice,&#34; I said quietly. &#34;She&#39;s in good hands, Sophie. The doctors know what they&#39;re doing, and they promised to keep me updated on everything. Besides...&#34; I wasn&#39;t sure what to say because I knew how it would sound: &#34;I can&#39;t drop everything right now.&#34; There&#39;s too much going on with Monroe Enterprises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me. &#34;That&#39;s more important than your mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed and put my finger on the bridge of my nose. &#34;Of course not. But I&#39;m trying to hold everything together. For her. For Ethan. For all of this.&#34; I motioned vaguely, as if that explained the mess my life had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophie didn&#39;t say anything, but the disapproval was clear on her face. I didn&#39;t blame her. Part of me hated myself for leaving Willow Creek so soon, but what choice did I have?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trip back to New York was quiet, the tension between us stretching thin but unspoken. Sophie flipped through a magazine, pointedly avoiding me, while I stared out the window, trying to prepare myself for what lay ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time we landed Sophie returned to the apartment, while I went straight to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stepped into my office unexpectedly, a thick folder in his hand. He shut the door behind him and walked over to my desk with the cool accuracy of someone who always got what they wanted. I looked up from my laptop, already bracing myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got something for you,&#34; he said, setting the folder down in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I asked, pausing before reaching for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Details on a new deal,&#34; he said simply. His tone was neutral, but there was an edge to it-a test lying beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flipped it open, scanning the contents. My eyes opened at some of the words. I looked back up at him, my stomach twisting. &#34;Ethan, this this doesn&#39;t seem legal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged, his face blank. &#34;It&#39;s not as bad as it looks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not as bad?&#34; I repeated, incredulous. &#34;These accounts are&#34; I trailed off, lowering my voice as if the walls had ears. &#34;They&#39;re completely off the books.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the desk, arms crossed. &#34;Emily, this is how business works. Not everything is black and white. Sometimes, you have to work in the gray to get things done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t gray. This is pitch black,&#34; I said, my voice trembling despite my attempt to stay firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you trust me?&#34; he asked suddenly, his tone easing just enough to catch me off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked, thrown by the question. &#34;Of course I do, but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then trust that I wouldn&#39;t put you in a position you couldn&#39;t handle,&#34; he interrupted. &#34;This deal is important. For the company. For us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, searching his face for any sign of hesitation, any hint that he might be testing me. But Ethan&#39;s mask of calm never slipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happens if this goes wrong?&#34; I asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t,&#34; he said with confidence. &#34;I&#39;m not asking you to do anything I wouldn&#39;t do myself. I just need you to step up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Step up. My hands tensed around the folder, the weight of his words pressing down on me. This was more than a deal-it was an entrance into the world he lived in, the one I had been tiptoeing around since I joined Monroe Enterprises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to refuse. Every part of my moral compass screamed at me to push the folder back at him and say no. But the way he looked at me, his tone, the way he said us-it all chipped away at my resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I did this, maybe he&#39;d trust me more. Maybe it would bring me closer to understanding him, to breaking through the walls he&#39;d built around himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath and nodded. &#34;Okay. I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s mouth curved into a faint smile. &#34;I knew I could count on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked out, the folder still in my hands, I stared at the door for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the truth was, I&#39;d go far. For him. For Margo. For this family I&#39;d barely started to understand but couldn&#39;t seem to let go of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I finished for the day, the weight of it all had rested heavily on my shoulders. I stepped out of the building, holding my bag tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; Ben&#39;s voice greeted me, snapping me out of my thoughts. He was leaning casually against a light, looking far too relaxed for someone who probably knew more about the mess Ethan and I were tangled in than he let on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ben,&#34; I said, managing a small smile. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Waiting for you,&#34; he said, falling into step beside me as I walked toward my car. &#34;Ethan asked me to keep an eye on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at him quickly. &#34;I don&#39;t need a babysitter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;It&#39;s not about babysitting. It&#39;s about making sure you don&#39;t get overloaded. You&#39;ve got a lot on your plate, Emily. More than most people could handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words surprised me. I studied him for a moment, trying to assess his sincerity. &#34;Thanks,&#34; I said slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anytime,&#34; he said with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride home was uneventful, but the moment I walked into the apartment, I felt Sophie&#39;s anxiety before I saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; I called out, setting my bag down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She appeared in the doorway, her arms crossed. &#34;You were late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had work,&#34; I said, brushing past her toward the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Work,&#34; she repeated, her voice sharp. &#34;Is that what we&#39;re calling it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, turning to face her. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It means I overheard you talking to Ethan earlier,&#34; she said, moving closer. &#34;Shady deals? Offshore accounts? Emily, what the hell is going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes briefly, forcing myself to stay calm. &#34;You don&#39;t understand-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right I don&#39;t understand!&#34; she interrupted. &#34;You&#39;ve changed, Emily. Ever since you got involved with Ethan and Monroe Enterprises, you&#39;re not the same person anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words stung, but I refused to show it. &#34;I&#39;m doing what needs to be done,&#34; I said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what? For who?&#34; she demanded. &#34;Because it sure as hell doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s for my family,&#34; I snapped, my voice rising. &#34;Something you wouldn&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face faltered, but only for a moment. &#34;I understand more than you think,&#34; she said softly. &#34;And I&#39;m telling you, this isn&#39;t the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled quickly, running a hand through my hair. &#34;You don&#39;t get it, Sophie. Ethan needs me. Margo needs me. If that means bending the rules, then so be it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what about you?&#34; she asked, her voice soft now. &#34;What happens to you in all of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked away, unable to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emily,&#34; she said, stepping closer. &#34;You&#39;re my best friend, and I&#39;m scared for you. You&#39;re in too deep, and I don&#39;t know how to pull you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need to be pulled out,&#34; I said, forcing myself to meet her look. &#34;I need you to trust me. Can you do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t answer right away, and the silence between us felt heavier than any fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll try,&#34; she said finally. &#34;But only because I care about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, feeling a pang of guilt. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I turned to escape to my room, her voice stopped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Emily,&#34; she said, &#34;just promise me one thing. Don&#39;t lose yourself in all of this. You&#39;re worth more than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words echoed in my mind long after I closed the door behind me.</p>
