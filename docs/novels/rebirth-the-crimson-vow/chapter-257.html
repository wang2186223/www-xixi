                <p>&#34;Honey, you misunderstood. I was just trying to get close to him to help with your job.&#34;</p>

                <p>He wasn&#39;t negotiating; he was informing her. &#34;We&#39;re going to schedule the divorce now. In a month, we&#39;ll finalize it. Orla, I don&#39;t want you anymore. The house is mine, and the kids are mine. I can&#39;t trust someone like you with our children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Orla cried harder, but it was no use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Christina was missing her daughter. She hadn&#39;t seen Harper in days and needed their nightly video calls to sleep peacefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa would also say hello to Harper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, have you not been eating well? You seem much weaker than before,&#34; Harper, even as a child, noticed something was wrong with Elisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa was much thinner than twenty days ago, as fragile as paper, as if a gust of wind could blow her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa smiled and shook her head. &#34;Grandma is getting old. You need to be good and listen to your mom. Grandma will be watching over you from a very far place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is that far place? Is it another country?&#34; Harper asked, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was better to tell a little white lie than to explain death to such a young child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina watched from the side, feeling an indescribable sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been away for so many days, watching her mother&#39;s condition worsen. Now, Elisa was at death&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina wanted to do something, but there was nothing she could do. The helplessness was torturous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, let&#39;s go back home tomorrow. They say you should return to your roots. I don&#39;t want to stay here anymore,&#34; Elisa said after hanging up the call. &#34;I don&#39;t want to stay in the hospital. I want to spend my last days at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, whatever you want,&#34; Christina agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bought plane tickets for the next day and took Elisa to the airport early in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flight was five hours long, and Elisa slept for four of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so weak now that even talking was exhausting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William had gotten the news and was waiting with Harper in the terminal. When he saw them, he immediately went to support Elisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William, how have you and Harper been getting along?&#34; Elisa gently patted his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William nodded. &#34;We&#39;ve been getting along great. Harper is very well-behaved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That puts my mind at ease. You&#39;re a responsible man. Please take care of them,&#34; Elisa said earnestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t say anything. In these final days, she would go along with whatever Elisa wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William also went along with her wishes, making many promises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa nodded, knowing William was a man of his word. With his promises, she felt at peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering her condition and personal wishes, William arranged for a home doctor so Elisa could rest at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina took a long leave from work to stay home with Harper and be with Elisa in her final days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the following days, Elisa&#39;s periods of lucidity grew shorter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ate less and less. At first, she could manage some liquid food, but eventually, she couldn&#39;t even drink water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The home doctor administered nutritional injections daily, but their effect was limited, and too many caused her skin to swell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, I don&#39;t want any more treatment,&#34; Elisa said during a moment of clarity. &#34;The thing I worry about most is you. Promise me you&#39;ll be good to William. It&#39;s best for you and Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; Christina said, her eyes moist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel Elisa&#39;s concern, even if she couldn&#39;t accept the way it was expressed. She appreciated the sentiment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the bedroom, Christina stood outside, her mind in turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa was in such pain, even with painkillers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want any more treatment, not wanting to prolong the suffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as a daughter, Christina found it hard to stop the nutritional injections, knowing it would hasten her mother&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, what are you thinking?&#34; William approached. &#34;You should eat something. You haven&#39;t eaten much these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not hungry,&#34; Christina shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed time to think about whether to continue the injections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could decide, that night, just as she lay down to rest, the home doctor knocked on her door. &#34;Ms. Windsor, your mother...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to my mom?&#34; Christina quickly opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran barefoot to Elisa&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa had only a breath left. She gripped Christina&#39;s hand, using all her strength to give her final advice, &#34;Be good to William... You all need to be good...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Elisa closed her eyes forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harper didn&#39;t understand death. She thought Elisa was just sleeping and tried to wake her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William,&#34; Christina called his name. &#34;Take Harper away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have the energy to care for Harper right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William picked Harper up. &#34;Sweetie, let&#39;s go to the next room to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to sleep. I want to see Grandma. What&#39;s wrong with her?&#34; Harper struggled in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at William, then at Christina, and asked, &#34;Is Grandma dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harper?&#34; William was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither he nor Christina had mentioned death to Harper. Had someone else told her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A classmate said his grandma died. Grandma told me she was going abroad, but that&#39;s not true,&#34; Harper said, her voice breaking. &#34;My grandma is dead. I don&#39;t have a grandma anymore.&#34;</p>
