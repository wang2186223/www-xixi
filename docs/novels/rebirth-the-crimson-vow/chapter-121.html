                <p>&#34;Wait, you sent those flowers?&#34; Christina&#39;s voice was a mix of surprise and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William had never done anything like this before, not in this life or the last. This was the first bouquet he had ever given her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of feeling touched, she let out a mocking laugh. &#34;You think a bunch of flowers can make up for all the crap you&#39;ve put me through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, then?&#34; William&#39;s eyes narrowed, but he didn&#39;t seem angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want you to stay away from me.&#34; Christina shot him a cold glance before turning and walking away quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, William got into his car and followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina! You took those flowers because you thought they were from someone else, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina paused for a moment. &#34;So what? If I had known they were from you, I would&#39;ve never taken them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William stopped in front of her, taking two steps at a time to block her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina looked at him warily. She was afraid of going through that kind of pain again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William reached out to grab her arm but accidentally caught her elbow instead. Though it had been two days, and walking wasn&#39;t too painful, his sudden grip made her gasp in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William noticed something was wrong and pulled her hand closer. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Where are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina felt his sudden concern was like a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at any moment. She tried to pull her hand back forcefully, but she wasn&#39;t strong enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rolled up her sleeve and saw the bruise, his expression turning serious. &#34;What happened? How did you get this bruise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina saw the worry on his face and a thought suddenly crossed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I said Jennifer did this, would you believe me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found herself hoping, just a little, that he wouldn&#39;t blindly trust Jennifer again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to her disappointment, William&#39;s face changed immediately. &#34;Christina, stop with the nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina knew then that Jennifer would always be his favorite. He might use her as a distraction in his life, but she would never surpass Jennifer&#39;s place in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t be foolish anymore. She smiled faintly. &#34;Just kidding. I fell by accident. If there&#39;s nothing else, I need to get back to the architecture firm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a project. If you have time, we should discuss it.&#34; William stood firmly in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina maintained her distant demeanor. &#34;Sorry, the firm has a policy that architects can&#39;t take on private work. If you need me, go through the firm. But I have a lot of projects right now, so even if you do, I probably won&#39;t have time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William could hear the rejection in her words and see the genuine distance in her expression. It wasn&#39;t an act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he was lost in thought, Christina had already walked away quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she got to the office, she couldn&#39;t understand why William was doing this. Was he bored and using her for amusement? But this time, she wouldn&#39;t let him control her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce came over and knocked on her desk. &#34;What are you daydreaming about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina glanced at him. &#34;Didn&#39;t know you were the office monitor now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who cares about you? Kelvin said the client wasn&#39;t happy with the last design,&#34; Bruce said coldly. &#34;I see you have a lot of projects. Why not give me a couple? I can help you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Help? He just wanted to take her projects because he was jealous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina sneered, resting her head on her hand as she looked at Bruce. &#34;Why pretend to be so noble? You mocked me for not being able to handle a project, and now you want my work. It&#39;s baffling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce&#39;s face turned red. &#34;If you don&#39;t want to, fine. I was just trying to help. If you think you can handle it all, suit yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and left, clearly annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina watched him go and smiled faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After work, as she was about to leave the firm, a luxury car pulled up nearby. The driver waved at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up and saw it was Walter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Walter.&#34; She walked over quickly. &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walter opened the car door. &#34;Get in first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina nodded slightly and got in, closing the door behind her. &#34;Walter, is there something you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t I just come to see you? Let&#39;s go get dinner.&#34; Walter smiled and started the car, heading towards downtown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chose a nice restaurant with a good reputation. Once they were seated, the waiter brought the menu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina felt relaxed for once and ordered a few dishes with a smile. &#34;Just tell me what you need. You don&#39;t have to bribe me. If I can help, I will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, someone invited me to an event abroad, but I need to bring a date. I don&#39;t have anyone else, so I thought of you.&#34; Walter looked a bit embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see.&#34; Christina felt a bit troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After thinking for a while, she asked, &#34;Is it an important event? Do you really need a date?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Walter nodded. &#34;You know, besides you, I can&#39;t think of anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina agreed reluctantly. &#34;Alright, how many days will it be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three to four days, maybe a week at most.&#34; Walter smiled as he looked at the menu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina calculated the time. She should be able to manage it, and she could work during the trip if needed. So she agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food arrived quickly. Walter cut a piece of steak and placed it on Christina&#39;s plate. &#34;Try it. How does it taste?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina took a bite and was pleasantly surprised. Her eyes lit up. &#34;You have great taste. This restaurant is excellent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if you&#39;re flattering me, I appreciate it.&#34; Walter laughed and continued to place more steak on her plate. &#34;Eat as much as you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their intimate interaction caught the eye of William, who had just walked in. He raised a cold eyebrow and stared at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shared her food with Walter and asked with a smile, &#34;So, when do we leave?&#34;</p>
