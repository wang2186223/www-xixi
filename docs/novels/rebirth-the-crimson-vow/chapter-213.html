                <p>But there was so much to do at the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From five in the morning until four in the afternoon, Christina had been swamped. She tidied up her desk and turned to her colleague, saying, &#34;I&#39;m heading out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll leave once I finish up here,&#34; her colleague replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina went to the basement, got her car, and drove out. Lately, work had been overwhelming, and her mood was low as she drove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she neared the preschool, she forced herself to perk up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, no matter what, she couldn&#39;t bring her bad mood to her child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, Christina parked by the curb, touched up her lipstick in the mirror, and, feeling a bit more presentable, managed a smile as she got out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was still some time before the preschool let out, so Christina stood by the entrance to wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she looked up, she saw a familiar face approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person was dressed in black, with neatly combed hair, walking in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina felt puzzled but didn&#39;t want to interact with this person for various reasons, so she instinctively turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the preschool bell rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harper, who was in the younger class, was one of the first to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Harper with her little pigtails walking out, Christina&#39;s heart melted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t think about anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was about to wave when the person in black approached her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William seemed to notice Christina for the first time and looked surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you here to pick up a child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though William didn&#39;t say it outright, his expression showed his surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t want to engage, but with so many people watching, ignoring him seemed inappropriate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to William with a cold expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it matter to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy, I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Harper&#39;s innocent voice called out. Christina crouched down and hugged her child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After greeting the teacher, she was ready to leave with Harper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a little boy ran by so fast that he almost bumped into Christina. She instinctively stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy ran straight into William&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad Cavendish, you finally came to pick me up. I missed you so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy said, snuggling into William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little rascal, did you listen to your teacher today?&#34; William&#39;s usually cold face softened, and his tone became gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, the teacher said I was very good today and even gave me a flower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina frowned slightly at this but said nothing, holding Harper as they walked towards the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened at school today, Harper?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way, Christina tried to distract herself by talking to Harper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you share with Mommy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, Mommy. The teacher told us many things and taught us how to make crafts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really liked the flower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harper&#39;s speech wasn&#39;t very fluent yet, but her big eyes blinked adorably, and her innocent tone melted Christina&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s great, Harper. You&#39;re so talented.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, William realized Christina had walked far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed helplessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The child in Christina&#39;s arms left him puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wondered if that child could be Harper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she be his and Christina&#39;s child, or was Christina just helping someone else pick up their kid, like him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in thought, he almost tripped over a stone while walking with his friend&#39;s child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad Cavendish, what are you thinking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. Do you want to go to my place first, or should I take you home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the boy was young, he had strong opinions, so William always asked for his input.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to go to your place. My dad never has time for me, and I don&#39;t want to stay with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William sighed silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended up taking the boy home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coincidentally, William and Christina met again at a red light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s window was half-open, while William&#39;s was fully closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could see out, but she couldn&#39;t see in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William watched Christina&#39;s profile, ready to ask the question he hadn&#39;t finished earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he opened his window, the light turned green, and Christina sped off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to follow, but she turned at the next intersection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They went their separate ways, and he had to give up the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back home, William let the boy play while he called his friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are you coming to pick up your son? If this keeps up, you might as well give him up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His friend, seemingly busy, explained helplessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how it is here. I&#39;ll come as soon as I can. My kid is a handful, sorry for the trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, William couldn&#39;t say much more, just urging his friend to come quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, he stared at his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to contact Christina. With his resources, he could easily find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after all his efforts, all he got from Christina were cold looks and sarcastic smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It left him feeling helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he had made mistakes, and he deserved this. There was no room for regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After much thought, he decided to contact Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at home, Christina washed Harper&#39;s hands and started cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William, excited as the call connected, walked to the balcony, ready to say something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he heard a child&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he hadn&#39;t seen clearly at the preschool, he remembered it was a little girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know how to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know how to define his relationship with Christina. Friends? That didn&#39;t seem right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But any other label would only anger Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle, wait a moment. Mommy is making something delicious. Should I call her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harper&#39;s logic was still developing, but she knew the call was for Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William almost panicked and hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad Cavendish, who were you talking to? Why are you so nervous? Do you have a girlfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the child&#39;s teasing, William picked him up and placed him on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t talk nonsense. Since you have no homework, look at your picture books. Your dad will pick you up later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He instructed the butler to prepare dinner for the boy and went to his study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt he needed to clear his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Christina finished cooking and found Harper quietly reading a picture book.</p>
