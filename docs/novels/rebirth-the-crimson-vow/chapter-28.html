                <p>After registering, Christina left the school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to go back to William&#39;s villa right now, and of course, she wouldn&#39;t go back to the Cavendish Mansion at this critical moment either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, William definitely wouldn&#39;t allow her not to return to the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only forcibly stall for time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t expect a van to suddenly stop in front of her, the rear door opened, and inside were several men wearing masks and sunglasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a parking lot not far behind her, but the car didn&#39;t stop there; instead, it stopped right next to her, which was already a bit strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, the men in the car were covered up so tightly that not even their eyes were visible, and Christina&#39;s intuition kept warning her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that these men seemed to be getting out of the car, Christina turned around and ran, regardless of whether these people were bad guys or not, it was better to run first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would rather misunderstand them than stand there foolishly and wait until she was really in danger, by then it would be too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s running, chase her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man&#39;s voice vaguely came from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina ran even faster. She wanted to call the police, but her phone was in her backpack, and it was a bit difficult to take it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t dare to stop for a moment, fearing that this group of people would catch up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn&#39;t outrun these men. The footsteps behind her were getting louder, and the distance between them was getting closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no one on the road at this time, so even if Christina wanted to ask for help, she couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, she saw a car parked ahead with its hazard lights on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The license plate was unfamiliar; she had never seen it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she couldn&#39;t care about that now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina ran over as fast as she could, directly opened the back door, got in, and closed the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From this angle, she could clearly see that the men had already caught up to the car. If she had been a step slower, they would have caught her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They looked at the car with resentment but were also wary and didn&#39;t dare to come over directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to turn and apologize to the person in the car, to explain her actions, when she heard a familiar voice next to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of the car!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was William&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she had randomly gotten into a car, and it turned out to be William&#39;s?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina wished this was her imagination; she really didn&#39;t want to deal with William right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise, she wouldn&#39;t have been wandering outside the school alone after class, trying to stall for time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, are my words useless now? I told you to get out, didn&#39;t you hear me?&#34; William urged impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fell on Christina, very cold, without a trace of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What time was it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina should have been home long ago, but she was still outside and had offended a group of people who were chasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she wanted to bring her mess to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could William tolerate this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina couldn&#39;t get out of the car now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those men were obviously watching her closely, possibly hiding in some corner waiting for her. If she got out, wouldn&#39;t she be caught by them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to reason with William, &#34;Could you please give me a ride to a busy intersection and drop me off? It&#39;s a special situation today, otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t trouble you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I your personal driver?&#34; William didn&#39;t buy it at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a back-and-forth, Christina was also filled with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for avoiding William, she wouldn&#39;t have been outside alone and wouldn&#39;t have encountered those men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was his attitude now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bob, drive.&#34; Christina didn&#39;t want to waste more words with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She directly called the assistant&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob was in a dilemma; one told him to stop, the other told him to drive. It was really difficult for him, a small person, to decide whom to listen to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he was hesitating, a horn sounded from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another car was coming and urging them to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob quickly stepped on the gas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William inadvertently looked up and saw those men hiding around the corner; they didn&#39;t look like good people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he didn&#39;t like Christina, he couldn&#39;t just watch her die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tacitly allowed Christina to stay in the car and didn&#39;t mention making her get out again, &#34;You are a student, and a student&#39;s main task is to study. Don&#39;t hang out with those shady people every day. Even if you don&#39;t care about your reputation, at least care about your safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today she was lucky to run into him. If she hadn&#39;t, could Christina have escaped from those men on her own?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would have happened to her was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was furious at his words, &#34;Can you stop slandering me? Is it my fault that I was targeted by bad guys? What you&#39;re saying now is victim-blaming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never seen those men and had no connection with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina,&#34; William&#39;s face grew colder, and his tone more threatening, &#34;Is this how you talk to your savior?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina simply turned her head to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t look at William and didn&#39;t want to talk to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere in the car became awkward and heavy, and Bob didn&#39;t dare to make a sound, just silently driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon the car passed by a large shopping mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those men had been left behind, and even if they followed, there were many people here, so they probably wouldn&#39;t dare to make a move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bob, stop the car, I want to get out.&#34; Christina put her hand on the door handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob didn&#39;t step on the brake; he was waiting for William&#39;s instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Christina didn&#39;t say anything more, just pressed the door handle with a bit of force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This scared Bob, and he instinctively stepped on the brake, stopping the car steadily by the roadside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Christina pushed the door open and got out without saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her back, William pressed his lips tightly, his eyes filled with anger, &#34;She really has gotten bolder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got in and out of his car as she pleased, without even saying a word before leaving. Even a driver wouldn&#39;t be treated like this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had just been worried about Christina&#39;s safety and allowed her to stay in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really felt like killing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Cavendish,&#34; Bob finally spoke, &#34;Ms. Windsor getting out now is actually good. Otherwise, if we go to the company and reporters see her getting out of your car, they might start spreading rumors again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These entertainment reporters would eagerly post anything they saw online to make a profit.</p>
