                <p>&#34;At that time, in that place, and with everything your best friend Missy exposed, Christina, who do you think you&#39;re fooling?&#34; William&#39;s anger grew as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some things can&#39;t be delved into too deeply, or they&#39;ll all become problems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was angry, and Christina was equally furious. &#34;I&#39;m not treating anyone like a fool, but you shouldn&#39;t assume everyone is a scheming woman either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least up until now, I haven&#39;t gained any benefits. But you, you took away my precious first time having sex. I didn&#39;t even ask you to take responsibility, and here you are, overthinking everything. William, are you paranoid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina would never have dared to say such things to William in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had already died once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this life, if she didn&#39;t stand up for herself, was she supposed to let herself be oppressed and die again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t willing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll say it again, I have no interest in you. If you keep this up, I&#39;ll really suspect you&#39;re just looking for an excuse to get close to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina struggled, and seeing that William still wouldn&#39;t let go, she didn&#39;t care anymore and bit down on William&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William hadn&#39;t expected Christina to bite him, and his eyes grew even colder. &#34;Christina, are you a dog?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until she tasted a strong metallic flavor of blood in her mouth that she finally released her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s wrist now bore a row of bloody teeth marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina glared fiercely at William, now truly resembling a cornered, angry little beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t let go. William, don&#39;t provoke me any further, or I&#39;ll set your house on fire. At worst, we&#39;ll go down together!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already said her harsh words; what happened next was William&#39;s problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William roared in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t respond and quickly ran forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She practically sprinted out of William&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to walk a bit further to catch a cab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hailing a cab at a landmark intersection, Christina instructed the driver to head straight to the school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, when she arrived at the school, people avoided her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she got to her class, none of her classmates would look her in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until the teacher arrived. Christina didn&#39;t believe Missy could have registered her, so she went to the teacher to register herself. But to her surprise, the teacher&#39;s expression was not friendly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just looking for you. Since you&#39;re here, let&#39;s talk about your problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina frowned. &#34;Teacher, what problem could I have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was exams or competitions, she always relied on her own abilities. In class, she never had conflicts with her classmates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teacher patted the desk. &#34;You have the nerve to ask me? Christina, as a student, don&#39;t you know to respect your elders and maintain order?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at the mess you&#39;ve caused online. What normal person would like their elders? You&#39;re affecting the school and the class too much. You should take a break from school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online, it was Jennifer who was being scolded, and Jennifer who drugged William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even defended herself yet, and now the public opinion had turned into insults against her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, in front of the teacher, Christina didn&#39;t speak as sharply as she did with William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina calmly said, &#34;Teacher, if you look closely at the public opinion, you&#39;ll see that this isn&#39;t my fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jennifer was the one who drugged William. I was just inadvertently involved with William. And I&#39;m the victim here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina spoke clearly, &#34;Teacher, why don&#39;t you stand by your student and consider my side? I haven&#39;t gained any benefits. Besides, even if it was me, what does my private life have to do with the school? The people spreading my business are the real culprits!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t said a word online to defend herself, while Jennifer was crying and threatening suicide, and Missy was the one who exposed everything first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was this her fault?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teacher didn&#39;t care about any of that. &#34;If you&#39;re feeling wronged, you can go to the police for help. But you shouldn&#39;t be causing all this public opinion and affecting everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina realized that registering today was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wasn&#39;t going to drop out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want me to drop out, you should give me a legitimate reason. I&#39;m clearly the victim here. Otherwise, I&#39;ll take this matter to the education department.&#34; Christina didn&#39;t want to be at odds with a teacher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But given the teacher&#39;s attitude, Christina knew she had to say something harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teacher wasn&#39;t afraid of Christina&#39;s threat. &#34;You&#39;re a problem student, affecting the school and the class. It&#39;s normal to ask you to take a break. Besides, this isn&#39;t compulsory education; the school has every right to expel you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With things said to this point, Christina felt she had nothing to lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled. &#34;You&#39;re just a homeroom teacher. The dean and principal haven&#39;t said anything. Who gave you the right to expel me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s none of your business. But starting today, you don&#39;t need to come anymore. Go to the dean&#39;s office to complete the formalities.&#34; The teacher didn&#39;t want to say anything more to Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina couldn&#39;t bear this injustice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately called the education department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, the education department sided with the school, even using the same tone, saying she was a problem student and the school&#39;s decision to expel her was reasonable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The education department wouldn&#39;t help?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina then took the matter online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t wanted to go this far, but they forced her hand. So, she didn&#39;t mind making a bigger deal out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even added a striking headline: &#34;I&#39;m the one who got hurt, so why do I have to pay for everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online, she briefly summarized her experiences with William, including the argument with William and Missy at the architecture institute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The post quickly garnered a lot of comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way? Is the poster really this miserable? She lost her virginity and everything. I hope she doesn&#39;t end up with no way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of society is this? There&#39;s no way she&#39;ll have no way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She lost her virginity, her education, and now she&#39;s being blamed for everything online. Isn&#39;t this just pushing her to the edge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god! When you put it that way, it&#39;s really terrifying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are we still here? The most we can do is say a few words online. The poster should call the police!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, call the police, don&#39;t wait!&#34;</p>
