                <p>Aiden had only touched her a few times before he started having wicked thoughts. &#34;I heard you&#39;re still a student. It&#39;d be such a waste if you died now. How about you become my mistress? I won&#39;t kill you then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t want to die, but she definitely didn&#39;t want to get involved with a man like him.</p>

                <p>&#34;Aiden, what are you doing?&#34; Bianca, who had just walked into the cabin, came back out, looking displeased. &#34;The captain is ready to head back. Hurry up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aiden felt a pang of regret for not getting Christina, but he couldn&#39;t admit his intentions in front of Bianca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dragged Christina to the side of the deck and forcefully pushed her over the edge. &#34;Go to hell!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden light shone on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aiden&#39;s expression changed from menacing to panicked. How could there be another boat nearby?</p>

                <p>No, he had to think of something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph lowered his flashlight, his mouth agape. &#34;Guess what I just saw?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A murder?&#34; William said offhandedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph nodded vigorously. &#34;Not just a murder, but someone we know. You know Christina, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Joseph didn&#39;t like Christina, if she got yelled at, he&#39;d probably clap along. But seeing her pushed into the sea was a matter of life and death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter their past issues, saving her was the priority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tossed William&#39;s fishing rod aside. &#34;Stop fishing and call the Coast Guard. We need to get over there and save her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the one who dragged me out here for night fishing, and now you&#39;re saying to stop.&#34; William was both amused and annoyed. &#34;Don&#39;t tell me you saw Christina committing murder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how outrageous Christina was, she wouldn&#39;t commit murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph slapped his thigh. &#34;She didn&#39;t kill anyone. She was tied to a chair and pushed into the sea. If we don&#39;t get there soon, she&#39;ll be shark food!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s expression changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph was a doctor; he wouldn&#39;t joke about something like this. Christina was really in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll start the boat. You call for help and get more people. We need to save her first.&#34; Joseph quickly headed to the cockpit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He revved the engine and steered the boat towards where Christina had fallen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aiden was now completely panicked, his hands and feet trembling uncontrollably. &#34;What do we do? They&#39;re coming over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just kill them all,&#34; Bianca suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Aiden slapped her hard across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t like killing chickens. It&#39;s murder! I don&#39;t even know how many people are on that boat, and murder is illegal!&#34; Aiden was furious. He had already killed Mia and Christina. That was two lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he killed more people, it would be a major crime. The police would get involved, and they wouldn&#39;t be able to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could face the death penalty!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do then? We can&#39;t just stand here and wait for them to take us to the police. I want our son to have a good life, not become an orphan.&#34; Bianca was on the verge of tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was truly regretting it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had known, she would have let Mia live a bit longer, tricked her into going abroad, and let her die quietly there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s head back. We&#39;ll create an alibi. That person probably didn&#39;t see my face clearly. Let&#39;s go back.&#34; Aiden clung to the hope that the person hadn&#39;t seen him clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca, equally panicked, ran to inform the captain to turn back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Joseph&#39;s boat arrived, they had already fled far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They think they can run after committing a crime? In this day and age, with big data, they&#39;ll be caught in no time.&#34; Joseph sneered at the retreating boat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He decided to let them go for now. The police would catch up with them eventually, and they&#39;d face justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, he and William needed to save Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina was tied to a chair and thrown into the sea. She must be at the bottom by now. You stay on the boat; I&#39;ll go down.&#34; William took off his jacket, grabbed a diving flashlight, and jumped into the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph anxiously waited on the boat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to help search, but he knew staying on the boat was the best way to support William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was on the brink of suffocation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe that after being given a second chance at life, she was going to die silently in the deep sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t accept her fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the chair leg was stuck in a rock crevice, and her hands were tightly bound. She couldn&#39;t muster any strength. She could only wait for death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a light shone in her vision. William swam towards her quickly, circled behind her, and cut the ropes on her wrists with a sharp knife. Then he grabbed her and swam towards the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, they both broke through the water&#39;s surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina greedily gulped in the fresh air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any strength left? If you do, grab the rope, and I&#39;ll pull you up.&#34; Joseph had tied a knot in the boat&#39;s rope and threw it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina looked up and saw it was him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph sarcastically remarked, &#34;Ms. Windsor, at a time like this, you wouldn&#39;t still want me to leave, would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me remind you, there aren&#39;t many people night fishing. In your current state, you won&#39;t last long. If you miss us, you&#39;ll really be left to die in the sea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina wouldn&#39;t let their past issues make her give up her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly grabbed the rope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You grabbed that pretty fast.&#34; Joseph said, but his hands didn&#39;t stop moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and William, who was already on the boat, pulled her up quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they confirmed Christina was out of danger, Joseph wanted to mock her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could, Christina urgently pointed to the sea. &#34;You need to save someone else. Another person was thrown into the sea, also tied to a chair. If we delay any longer, she might not make it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia had been in the water much longer than she had!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s face turned serious. &#34;What&#39;s going on? William, take care of her. I&#39;m going down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the doctor. You stay here.&#34; William said, already jumping into the water.</p>
