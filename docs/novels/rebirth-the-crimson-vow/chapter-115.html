                <p>Christina kept refusing to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just didn&#39;t want to, and Kenna couldn&#39;t exactly force her to open her mouth and shove food in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Windsor, why don&#39;t you close your eyes and rest for a bit? If you get hungry, just let me know,&#34; Kenna suggested, moving to a chair in the corner and pulling out her phone to update William on the day&#39;s events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was in the middle of a meeting at the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he saw his phone light up, he glanced at it, and his expression immediately turned serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina wasn&#39;t eating again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He instinctively thought Christina was throwing a tantrum with the nurse, deliberately harming her own body. This couldn&#39;t go on!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meeting&#39;s over,&#34; William announced, standing up and leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drove to the hospital as fast as he could. He considered buying a meal from a nearby restaurant but decided to call the housekeeper instead. &#34;Can you prepare a nutritious meal and bring it to the hospital? Make sure it&#39;s something light.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how good the food outside was, it couldn&#39;t compare to the fresh, clean, and nutritious meals from home. Given Christina&#39;s current condition, she needed the best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making these arrangements, he headed upstairs to see Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Cavendish, you&#39;re here,&#34; Kenna said, stepping aside to leave the room for William and Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s eyes were still closed, her brows slightly furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really was like a ghost that wouldn&#39;t leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to avoid talking to him, but William walked straight to her bedside and sat down. &#34;I know you&#39;re not asleep. Stop pretending.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t I just rest for a bit?&#34; Christina looked up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not stopping you from resting, but I won&#39;t agree to you starving yourself. We already agreed that you&#39;d be discharged tomorrow. What more do you want?&#34; William couldn&#39;t understand what she was upset about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t he tried to meet all her demands?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s expression remained indifferent. &#34;I&#39;m not protesting by starving myself. I&#39;m just not hungry right now. You can&#39;t control when I eat, can you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even pets at home could eat whenever they wanted. Why should she have a set meal time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s brow furrowed, his eyes growing stern. &#34;Christina, don&#39;t play these games with me. I know you too well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? You know me?&#34; Christina laughed as if she&#39;d heard a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he really knew her, what had he been doing in their past life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite living another life, she had grown further from him, and their interactions had decreased significantly. Yet, he was saying this now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was so hypocritical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t handle your so-called understanding, William. Sometimes I really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re thinking. You say you don&#39;t like me, so why won&#39;t you let me go? You insisted on marrying me, but after the wedding, you won&#39;t cherish me. Instead, you&#39;ll torment me to death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina!&#34; William interrupted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked incredulous. &#34;What nonsense are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how much he disliked Christina, she was still Raymond&#39;s daughter. He would never bully her because of that connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, he wasn&#39;t some kind of pervert with a weird fetish. Why would he make life difficult for his own wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you really need to see a psychologist,&#34; William said, exasperated. He couldn&#39;t think of any other explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s hostility and prejudice against him were completely unfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t done anything wrong or hurt her. Why did she see him as the bad guy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m sick. So please, be considerate of a patient and stay away from me. Don&#39;t make it worse. Can you do that?&#34; Christina didn&#39;t want to argue with him, so she went along with his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll leave, but you have to eat properly,&#34; William bargained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to being in the same room with someone she disliked, eating was a pleasure for Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, how could she have the strength to escape if she didn&#39;t eat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chose the latter. &#34;Fine, give me the food. I&#39;ll eat it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be sure, William watched her finish the meal before he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t go straight home but went to see Joseph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It happened to be Joseph&#39;s shift that night, and with no patients around, Joseph had ordered some takeout and invited William to his office. &#34;What brings you here tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you before, I suspect Christina has a psychological issue. Now I think it&#39;s getting worse,&#34; William said, clearly troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any way to make her act more normal, at least stop hating me so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph shrugged. &#34;We&#39;ve been friends for so long, but there&#39;s nothing I can do. She doesn&#39;t just hate you; she has a grudge against me too. I can&#39;t figure out what I did to offend her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it&#39;s like those online theories about people being destined enemies?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the problem couldn&#39;t be solved, maybe they should address the root cause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She seems to get along fine with others, right? Maybe you should just stay away from her,&#34; Joseph suggested, thinking it was the simplest solution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With William&#39;s status, he wouldn&#39;t have trouble finding women. Why insist on being with Christina?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William glared at him. &#34;Is that how you treat patients? Telling their families to stay away from them? If word got out, you&#39;d be famous for all the wrong reasons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph knew he had a point. &#34;I was just joking. Give it some time. When Christina&#39;s condition improves, I&#39;ll help you figure it out. Right now, I&#39;m honestly scared of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A patient who might actually attempt suicide was terrifying for any doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s unease grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a nagging feeling that if he didn&#39;t change Christina&#39;s view of him soon, he would lose her for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked Joseph, &#34;What do women her age usually like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re asking me?&#34; Joseph pointed to himself, more shocked than William. &#34;Come on, you should ask women her age. I&#39;m a bachelor. How would I know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right,&#34; William agreed, not pressing Joseph further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After thinking it over, he decided Jennifer was the best person to ask. She was around Christina&#39;s age, so their interests should be similar.</p>
