                <p>Walter was floored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, he&#39;d been played?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William had clearly figured something was off a while ago. He hadn&#39;t said anything because he was playing along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luca&#39;s your guy, right? He&#39;s been taken in for tax evasion. This has your fingerprints all over it, doesn&#39;t it?&#34; William&#39;s tone was firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Walter had stuck to the plan, his funds would&#39;ve been tied up, and he wouldn&#39;t have been able to turn things around. They would&#39;ve pinned the tax evasion charges on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a police car pulled up. Two officers got out, cuffed Walter, and took him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhea watched the whole thing, feeling like her world was falling apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been so close to happiness, holding each other tight, their beautiful future within reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, Walter was being taken away by the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with her limited knowledge, Rhea knew that tax evasion meant prison time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When would they see each other again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William, no matter what, Walter is still part of the Cavendish family. Treating him like this goes against Nicholas&#39;s last wishes. You&#39;re being unfilial!&#34; Rhea placed all her hopes on William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he was willing to show mercy, Walter could come out safely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t care about a life of luxury anymore. She didn&#39;t need to be a wealthy wife. She just couldn&#39;t accept a life without Walter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William looked at her like she was already dead. &#34;Do you think you have any leverage to bargain with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about this child?&#34; Rhea placed a hand on her stomach. &#34;If you dare to harm him, I&#39;ll abort this baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not the real Christina. Tell me where Christina is.&#34; William&#39;s voice was icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhea suddenly laughed. &#34;No wonder you&#39;ve been restricting me. You knew I was a fake all along. Christina isn&#39;t dead. She&#39;s alive and well. One life for another. Let my lover go, and I&#39;ll give you back yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William agreed to the deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhea bought the earliest flight ticket. She was going to bring Christina back to William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she opened the door to the basement, it was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe it and searched the entire house. All the jewelry and valuables were gone, and a mark was left on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she tried to make sense of it, a news report caught her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhea&#39;s eyes widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her house was in a remote area with poor security, and there were two gangs nearby that often clashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had chosen to keep Christina there because the police wouldn&#39;t search the area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she hadn&#39;t expected a serial killer to be operating nearby, who had murdered seven women and stolen their jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The key evidence was that the killer always left a mark on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhea had no choice but to tell William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lying to me!&#34; William was instantly furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina couldn&#39;t be dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been given a second chance at life. He wanted to protect her and their daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had been resolved, and no one would accuse Christina of being a murderer. But because of Rhea...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhea anxiously explained, &#34;I&#39;m not lying. I really love Walter. I wanted to bring her to you in exchange for his safety, but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she explained, the angrier William became. At the same time, a deep sense of helplessness washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had investigated faster, Christina might have been back with him already, safe from harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, he still didn&#39;t believe Christina was in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to investigate himself!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhea knew William wouldn&#39;t help her anymore. She had to save Walter herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what could she do alone to get Walter out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one option left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went to the police station under the pretense of visiting Walter. Looking into his eyes, she was filled with longing. &#34;Walter, I&#39;m getting you out today. They won&#39;t stop us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you planning? Where&#39;s Christina?&#34; Walter blurted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She responded with a bitter smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhea unbuttoned her shirt, revealing a simple bomb strapped to her body. &#34;Forget about her. Let&#39;s run away together. I&#39;ve saved some money over the years. It&#39;s enough to support you. We&#39;ll both work, and our lives will only get better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police quickly noticed the situation on the surveillance cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tried to approach Rhea, but she made a scene, insisting on rescuing Walter or everyone would die together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bang!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gunshot rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhea&#39;s life ended there. She fell in a pool of blood, her eyes fixed on Walter, wanting to remember him forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only there was no Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would have met, fallen in love, and been happier than anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped that in the next life, she would meet Walter early on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rhea?&#34; Walter wasn&#39;t sad about her death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given what Rhea had done, she deserved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he wanted to know if Christina was safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, Rhea had closed her eyes forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four years later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valoria Airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina, dressed in a sharp, professional outfit, held her daughter&#39;s hand. &#34;Harper, let&#39;s get something to eat first, then we&#39;ll check into the hotel, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy, can I have McDonald&#39;s?&#34; Harper asked sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at her daughter, Christina&#39;s heart melted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she had given birth to Harper alone in a foreign country, and even though Harper carried half of William&#39;s blood, she was still her Harper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Harper was back, and that made everything worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up her daughter. &#34;Sure, Mommy will take you there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they had eaten, the mother and daughter went to a nearby hotel. To make sure Harper was comfortable, Christina booked a deluxe suite. &#34;Sweetie, Mommy has to work now. Stay in the hotel, okay? If you need anything, call Mommy. Don&#39;t go out on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Stargate City had good security, Harper was still so young. Christina couldn&#39;t help but worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harper nodded vigorously. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Mommy. I can play by myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina kissed her daughter&#39;s cheek before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had returned to take charge of a project. To get a promotion and a raise, and to give Harper a better life, she had chosen to come back to this land.</p>
