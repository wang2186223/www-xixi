                <p>Christina&#39;s smile didn&#39;t fade, &#34;It&#39;s none of my business, but it&#39;s hard not to hear what you&#39;re saying when it reaches my ears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Spencer, just tell me, is what I&#39;m saying true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s smile didn&#39;t reach her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This expression made Jennifer extremely angry. She had tried so hard to move into William&#39;s villa but failed, while Christina moved in so easily and was so arrogant about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William hadn&#39;t said a word yet. Was he tacitly approving of everything Christina did?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer could only suppress the anger in her heart. She turned to look at William, crying miserably, &#34;William, I didn&#39;t expect it to be like this. I know, you always thought I was good, that I didn&#39;t quite deserve it. I really do want to go back to the School of Architecture. I stayed there for so long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer was only exposed in a scandal during a competition, even if she had someone ghostwrite for her. She had been in the School of Architecture for a long time, and Jennifer also had the connections her father had accumulated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father had clearly told her to avoid the current storm and then return to the School of Architecture later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for Jennifer, this was torture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The School of Architecture was full of talent. Every day she didn&#39;t go, many people were desperately trying to get in, and Christina had already been taken as an apprentice by Kelvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was very anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s why she thought of coming to William, hoping he could get her into the School of Architecture directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would have thought, Christina was here saying these things, intensifying the conflict, disrupting her plans!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t speak. He looked up, his eyes narrowing as he looked at Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s smile didn&#39;t fade a bit, her eyes even looked provocative, as if saying, &#34;See, I&#39;m right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t get it. You&#39;ve been with William for so long. If you want something, can&#39;t you just tell him directly? All these twists and turns, don&#39;t you find it tiring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, if you don&#39;t want me to lose my temper, go back to your room immediately.&#34; William&#39;s angry shout, with a look of oppression, immediately swept towards Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina wasn&#39;t scared off by William. Instead, she had already left an indelible mark in Jennifer&#39;s heart, achieving her goal of making Jennifer uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s nails dug deeply into her flesh, and at this moment, anger surged within her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really, for the first time, she wanted to kill someone, no, she wanted to tear Christina to pieces!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone makes mistakes. I can&#39;t interfere with your choices.&#34; William spoke lightly, pulling Jennifer&#39;s thoughts back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer looked at William in disbelief, &#34;William, are you trying to distance yourself from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s expression was indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was known for his cold and distant personality, but he had never treated her like this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer was truly scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, if you have any difficulties, I will help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s tone didn&#39;t change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a promise William had made early on, just because she had saved him once. But back then, she had only taken advantage of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, William was so outstanding. From the first time she saw him, she had fallen in love with him at first sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t really about her saving him, it was her secret!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s throat felt like it was blocked, &#34;William, what I want most now is to return to the School of Architecture. And, if you don&#39;t want to take responsibility for Christina, can you let me stay? You know, my only wish is to marry you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer opened her arms and hugged William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cried softly in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Jennifer had hugged William before, and William didn&#39;t feel much, the most he did was pat her shoulder or back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted him to marry her, and he had agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, William felt a bit impatient, probably because he saw Jennifer&#39;s tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too many things have happened recently. Let&#39;s put the marriage on hold for now. As for the School of Architecture, you can&#39;t go back at this critical moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But where should I go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t continue to submit manuscripts to the publisher for now. The editor said that if she wanted to submit, she had to change her pen name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That pen name had taken her years to build up. Change it? She was unwilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s voice was calm, &#34;If you feel you have nothing to do recently, you can stay by my side and do some work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had never been a female secretary by William&#39;s side. If she stayed by his side, she could seize the opportunity. She needed to find a chance to have a relationship with William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, Christina had taken advantage of the situation. She knew that this time, it wasn&#39;t just about having a relationship with William. She had to get pregnant with William&#39;s child so that he would marry her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer spoke hesitantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She actually wanted to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, William had no intention of letting her stay, and even said, &#34;You should go back. I&#39;ll notify you when there&#39;s a schedule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since William said so, she couldn&#39;t say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left unwillingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she could only wait and find another way later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she didn&#39;t continue to stand by the railing, she didn&#39;t go back to her room either. She listened to their conversation from a corner where William and Jennifer couldn&#39;t see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Look, as long as Jennifer cried a little in front of him, William had no resistance at all. But when she had cried her heart out in front of William with her daughter, William hadn&#39;t softened, not even for the child. She was more determined to drag Jennifer into hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because that way, Jennifer would be in pain, and William wouldn&#39;t have it easy either!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s cold voice hit Christina, bringing her thoughts back. She walked out, smiling at William, &#34;Uncle, you know me so well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s eyes flashed with a deadly coldness, &#34;Why do you have such hostility towards her? You can&#39;t break us up just because you want to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What hostility do I have towards her? I just don&#39;t like her and speak the truth. If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t listen. After all, you have the right not to listen to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was unaffected, her smile even deepened, &#34;Or, Uncle, are you too focused on me? Are you addicted to me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer was already furious, so William had to use some means here too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t torment these two, how could she make up for the pain she and Harper had suffered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, William was indeed furious, &#34;Christina, you&#39;re asking for death.&#34;</p>
