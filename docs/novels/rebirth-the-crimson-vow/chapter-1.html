                <p>Christina Cavendish died in flames after murdering her husband’s mistress—a final act of rage over their daughter’s death. Reborn five years earlier, she awakens on the night she was falsely accused of seducing her powerful uncle-in-law, William. This time, she shreds the script: exposing the real schemer, cutting ties with the toxic dynasty, and reclaiming her stolen designs. But William’s obsession deepens as she defies him, and her enemies plot in shadows. With her daughter’s memory as her sword, Christina will burn their gilded world to ashes… or die trying.</p>

                <p>In the hospital corridor, Harper Cavendish, who had just managed to escape from the kidnappers, collapsed to her knees upon hearing the news of her daughter&#39;s death. She cried out hoarsely, bowing her head to the doctors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s so young, please save her, save her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The medical staff present were moved by her grief, their eyes turning red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attending doctor choked up as he reached out to help her, hesitating, &#34;Please get up first. Harper&#39;s post-surgery infection and complications were too severe. We really did our best!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, if it had only been an infection, timely treatment could have saved Harper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the hospital had contacted Harper&#39;s father several times, only to be told that they were scammers, collaborating with Harper&#39;s mother in a charade, and he refused to come to the hospital to sign the consent forms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harper&#39;s mother had also been unreachable, ultimately missing the best time for rescue!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, seeing Harper&#39;s mother in such a state, it seemed she had also narrowly escaped death and suffered greatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina, kneeling on the ground, suddenly raised her head, revealing a bruised and swollen face to everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared fixedly at the doctor, &#34;My daughter has always been healthy. What kind of surgery did she undergo to result in an infection?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know? Harper underwent a kidney donation surgery!&#34; The doctor was somewhat surprised. Did she really not know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Christina&#39;s grief, the doctor couldn&#39;t help but sigh, &#34;I&#39;m really sorry. Please take care of yourself and don&#39;t be overly sad. Harper was trying to save someone; she was a little hero. You should quickly take Harper to the funeral home for cremation and let the child be buried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Christina&#39;s eyelashes trembled, &#34;May I ask who signed the surgery consent form?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was the child&#39;s father!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s frail body swayed, almost collapsing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was really him, it was really him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nails dug into her palms, her eyes filled with hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina wiped her tears fiercely, got up from the ground, and picked up her daughter&#39;s small body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor didn&#39;t know how to comfort this desperate woman and could only say dryly, &#34;The child saved by Harper&#39;s kidney will surely live well with her share of life. This can be considered another way Harper lives on in your memory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a sorrowful smile, &#34;The one who took my daughter&#39;s kidney and caused her death is my husband&#39;s illegitimate child. Do you think I can consider him a memory?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor was momentarily speechless!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had thought the child&#39;s father was being noble by allowing such a young child to donate a kidney, but it turned out it was to save his own illegitimate child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina ignored the doctor&#39;s complex expression, her tear-streaked face pressed against her daughter&#39;s cold little face, &#34;Harper, don&#39;t be afraid. Mommy will join you soon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After Mommy makes everyone who caused your death pay, Mommy will join you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the next life, you must come back as Mommy&#39;s daughter again, but we&#39;ll choose a different daddy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the funeral home, Harper&#39;s small body lay on a stretcher, being carried towards the crematorium.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was very thin, the white cloth covering her body barely showing any contours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her, Christina wore a black long dress, her long hair covering most of her bruised and swollen face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes, filled with despair and emptiness, were fixed on her daughter&#39;s small body, her bony hand tightly holding her daughter&#39;s small hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recalled Harper asking her more than once, &#34;Mommy, why does Daddy only hold Jennifer Spencer and Mike Spencer&#39;s hands but never holds mine and Mommy&#39;s?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it because I&#39;m a girl and Mike is a boy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Mommy. It&#39;s all because of me. If I were a boy, Daddy would like me a little more and like Mommy more too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer, mentioned by Harper, was William Cavendish&#39;s first love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five years ago, due to an accident, Christina and William had a sexual relationship. Later, when she found out she was pregnant, William had no choice but to marry her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that time, Jennifer, who was engaged to William, left the country in anger, and William hated Christina deeply for it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, five years later, when Jennifer returned with Mike, who was born prematurely and had kidney problems, crying and asking William for help, stubbornly and resolutely saying that if it weren&#39;t for the child&#39;s severe illness, she would never have returned to disturb him and Christina, William almost wanted to kill Christina!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since then, William never looked at Christina properly again and never showed Harper a kind face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave all his tenderness and time to Jennifer and their son, desperately searching for a kidney donor for Mike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Harper tried to get close to William, he would sternly reprimand her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still remembered that not long ago, on William&#39;s birthday, Harper had made a small cake by herself, hoping to share it with him, but William didn&#39;t come home until late at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, when he returned, Harper, full of hope, brought the cake to him, only for him to knock it to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina heard Harper&#39;s heart-wrenching cries and rushed in, only to be grabbed by the neck and pinned against the wall by William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s eyes were bloodshot, looking at her as if she were an enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was fierce and sinister, &#34;Christina, you harmed Jennifer. I want you to pay with your lives!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he had succeeded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her daughter, so considerate and obedient, willing to donate her kidney just to gain a bit of William&#39;s love, had been killed by William and Jennifer!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s eyes were dry, no more tears left to shed, only emptiness in her eyes and her daughter&#39;s stiff body before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Harper was sent into the crematorium and placed in a small urn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding Harper&#39;s ashes, Christina walked out of the funeral home into the pouring rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A funeral home staff member, feeling sorry for her, brought her an umbrella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t even look at it, walked to the roadside, got into a car, carefully placed Harper&#39;s ashes beside her, and then picked up her phone to make a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find out where Jennifer and her son are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, Christina looked at Harper&#39;s ashes on the passenger seat, her eyes gradually filling with madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out, gently stroking the urn, &#34;Harper, be good, wait a little longer for Mommy. Soon, Mommy will join you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone rang with a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing it, Christina immediately started the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her poor daughter had died from post-surgery infection, while William was happily riding the carousel with Jennifer and her son at the amusement park!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Harper was alive, she had begged her father more than once to take her to the amusement park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dare they? How could they?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina floored the gas pedal, the car shooting out like an arrow in the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, she arrived at the amusement park and saw from a distance Jennifer holding an umbrella and Mike&#39;s hand, waiting by the roadside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes filled with hatred, Christina didn&#39;t hesitate, flooring the gas pedal and driving straight at them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all because of Jennifer!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer had drugged William, taken the Cavendish family&#39;s money to leave the country, and upon returning, clung to William, slandering and harming her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Jennifer had caused her daughter&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why should Jennifer, after committing so many evil deeds, still live well?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer watched in horror as a car sped towards her, seeing Christina&#39;s twisted, ferocious face through the windshield!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; Jennifer screamed in terror, pulling her son to try to dodge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Christina&#39;s car was too fast!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to dodge in time, Jennifer and Mike were hit and thrown into the air, landing heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the two lying in a pool of blood, Christina showed a relieved yet crazed smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without stopping, she immediately turned the car around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having punished those who caused her daughter&#39;s death, it was time for her to join her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for William, didn&#39;t he care most about Jennifer and that child?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she would let him live, live to endure the pain of losing them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she drove away, she saw a black Bentley speeding towards Jennifer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the moment they passed, she saw William&#39;s panicked face in the driver&#39;s seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William saw her too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave him a provocative smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to the house she and William had lived in after their marriage, Christina gathered all of Harper&#39;s favorite things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she brought these to Harper, Harper would surely be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing, Christina cut the gas line and then lit a lighter!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boom!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the villa exploded, Christina looked out the window, seemingly seeing William, who had just gotten out of the car, frantically trying to rush in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he here to settle accounts with her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too bad, he would never have the chance again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harper, slow down, wait for Mommy, Mommy is coming to find you!</p>
