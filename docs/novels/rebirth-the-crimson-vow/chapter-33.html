                <p>It was already the final competition, and today the true winner would be selected from the works. Multiple TV stations had bought the broadcasting rights, and a panel of industry bigwigs served as judges. Multiple cameras were focused on the center stage, making it a highly anticipated event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host, dressed in formal attire, stood under the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dear guests, after several rounds of selection, ten contestants have made it to the final competition. Today, the ultimate winner will be chosen from these ten. Let&#39;s wait and see!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a round of cheers, the stage lights came on, and a platform slowly rose from below, displaying ten paintings covered with cloth, leaving the final suspense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judges whispered among themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contestants stood in front of their respective works.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer saw Christina standing next to her and slightly raised her chin, looking determined to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the music started, the mechanism in the air pulled up the cloth, revealing the ten paintings to the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who made it to the finals were naturally the best, and the ten paintings were so evenly matched that it was dazzling to look at them all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at that moment, a sudden exclamation erupted from the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are those two paintings exactly the same?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host glanced over and froze, but she quickly realized that this was not just a stage accident but a huge publicity opportunity that could make their show even more famous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pointed out two people: &#34;The authors of the two identical paintings are Jennifer and Christina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer turned around and saw the work in front of her, her face changing as she angrily questioned, &#34;You plagiarized me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina remained calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had anticipated this scene. In her previous life, Jennifer had publicly accused her of plagiarism, causing her to lose her footing in the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this life, Christina would not let Jennifer take what rightfully belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you say that?&#34; Christina raised her eyes indifferently. &#34;Plagiarizing your work without changing a single stroke and being caught in public-wouldn&#39;t that be foolish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows if you&#39;re trying to frame me?&#34; Jennifer snorted coldly. &#34;Besides, I have a bit of a reputation in the industry. Why would I need to plagiarize the work of someone unknown like you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this kind of competition, the audience was generally knowledgeable about the architecture industry, either students or professionals, and they began to whisper among themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is definitely plagiarism, but who copied whom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think Christina plagiarized Jennifer. Jennifer has shown her talent in various competitions before. If you&#39;re going to plagiarize, at least do it well. This is embarrassing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the public opinion leaning towards her, Jennifer&#39;s face showed a confident expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, I know you must have been desperate to do this. If you withdraw from the competition now, I&#39;ll plead with Mr. Cavendish to suppress the public opinion, and we&#39;ll pretend nothing happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina found it laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she took a step back, Jennifer would only press harder until she had no space to survive in the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do it, so I&#39;m not afraid. The judges are all industry experts. Why not let them take a good look and see who is really plagiarizing whom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m giving you a way out,&#34; Jennifer said through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had thought that bringing up William would make Christina back down, but even so, she was confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host seemed to have received a signal and began listing Jennifer&#39;s past honors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already at an advantage, Jennifer now gained even more public support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judges came forward to carefully examine the two works, which were almost identical in every stroke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s hard to tell. Kelvin Fisher, what do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s eyes turned to one person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin was a titan in the field of architectural design, and even two of the judges were his students.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, he had agreed to participate because the TV station had given him significant decision-making power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host subtly hinted, &#34;Jennifer is already somewhat famous. She has no need to plagiarize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin examined the works closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This style seems familiar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s heart skipped a beat, but she thought that Christina shouldn&#39;t have any connection with someone like Kelvin, so she boldly said, &#34;I often publish my works. Perhaps you saw one of them during your browsing. It&#39;s an honor that my work caught your eye, Mr. Fisher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Mr. Fisher praises the work, it seems Jennifer has a good chance of making it to the top three,&#34; the host interjected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any other works?&#34; Kelvin adjusted his glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Jennifer froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A person&#39;s design style is consistent,&#34; Kelvin said, making his point clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s face turned even more unsightly. &#34;The competition only requires one work. Why would I prepare more? That doesn&#39;t seem to fit the judging criteria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t, but isn&#39;t there a plagiarism issue now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin looked at the host. &#34;Do I need to discuss this with the organizers before making a final decision?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host, not daring to offend him, shook her head with a smile. &#34;The higher-ups said you have the final say in the competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Fisher, I happen to have a nearly completed work backstage. If you&#39;d like to see it, you can,&#34; Christina finally spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her calm and composed demeanor, Kelvin appreciated her even more. After all, designing required a calm mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin agreed. &#34;Alright, bring it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina instructed the staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, a new work was brought in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfolding it, Kelvin&#39;s eyes lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This architectural design is even better than the one on stage. Why didn&#39;t you choose this one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because it&#39;s not finished yet,&#34; Christina pointed to a corner of the design. &#34;You see here, due to the need to design fire escape routes and other factors, there are some flaws. I&#39;ve been thinking about how to make it more perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are truly meticulous,&#34; Kelvin&#39;s eyes showed a hint of admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing them chatting, Jennifer felt a pang of panic and quickly said, &#34;Mr. Fisher, you can&#39;t just conclude that I&#39;m the one plagiarizing, can you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t said that,&#34; Kelvin, who disliked being interrupted, replied with a stern face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might want to search for my works,&#34; Jennifer took a deep breath.</p>
