                <p>Having such an adorable daughter already makes you a winner in life, so why is Aiden so unsatisfied?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gently patted Lily&#39;s head. &#34;Alright, sweetie, you gotta tell me everything you&#39;re thinking. The more details, the better my magic will work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay!&#34; Lily nodded eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily then spilled out a flood of thoughts, and Christina jotted everything down, planning to draft a design tonight and show it to Lily tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Mia parked the car outside a burger joint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While ordering, she asked Christina, &#34;Do you like burgers? If you do, I&#39;ll grab you one too. If not, we can check out some other takeout options. My treat today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A burger&#39;s fine,&#34; Christina replied. She wasn&#39;t a huge fan of fast food, but she didn&#39;t mind it once in a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the burger joint, Aiden pointed inside. &#34;Those three. Tie them up. As long as you get the job done, money won&#39;t be an issue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia was an only child. Once she was out of the picture, all the family assets would go to Lily. And Aiden was Lily&#39;s biological father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With all that wealth in his hands, he could do whatever he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve come to the right people. As long as the money&#39;s good, there&#39;s nothing we can&#39;t do,&#34; one of the men behind him chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They waited outside the burger joint, ready to follow Mia as soon as she came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia initially planned to drop Christina back at school, but halfway there, she remembered something. &#34;How about you come home with me tonight? I want to renovate the house I&#39;m living in now. I don&#39;t want any traces of Aiden left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy, isn&#39;t Daddy coming home tonight?&#34; Lily suddenly asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia thought her daughter missed her father and was racking her brain for an explanation when Lily continued, &#34;Daddy&#39;s so weird. He said he was going to apologize to you tonight and wanted me to help him, but now he&#39;s nowhere to be seen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lily, did you really want to go to the beach with Mommy and Daddy, or did Daddy tell you to say that?&#34; Mia tried to keep her emotions in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily replied, &#34;Daddy told me to say that. He said you two had a fight, and he regretted it. He wanted me to help make you happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Mia&#39;s tears flowed uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank goodness she hadn&#39;t softened earlier. Aiden was truly despicable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, Mia told Christina, &#34;Not just the villa we&#39;re living in now, but any house he&#39;s ever been in-I want them all renovated. Ms. Windsor, I&#39;m counting on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was almost dizzy from the sudden windfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just from Mia alone, she stood to make a fortune!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With money on the line, she was all in. &#34;I&#39;ll come home with you tonight. I can take measurements for the renovation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s villa was in the suburbs, and it was already dark, with few cars on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway there, a car suddenly rammed into them from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia quickly got out to check the situation, but before she could say anything, someone covered her mouth and dragged her into a car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another man knocked on Christina&#39;s window. &#34;Hey, get out and see what you did to our car. The headlights are completely wrecked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina sensed something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the man quickly opened the car door and sprayed a sedative mist in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of dizziness hit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina wanted to call the police, but she didn&#39;t even have the strength to reach for her phone. Her head slumped, and she passed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she woke up, she found herself tied to a chair, with Mia beside her and the vast ocean behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were on a ship&#39;s deck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Mia Wilson? Wake up,&#34; Christina called softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia soon opened her eyes. Realizing their predicament, she struggled desperately to free herself from the ropes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Aiden approached with a lantern, Bianca by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no one else around, Aiden dropped all pretense, his eyes filled with malice. &#34;I was going to spare you, but you had to be shameless and break with me. Now neither of you will live!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let Ms. Windsor go. She has nothing to do with this. Where&#39;s Lily?&#34; Mia hadn&#39;t finished speaking when Aiden burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed Mia&#39;s face. &#34;You should worry about yourself. Neither of you will live. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll let Lily live a few more years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If your daughter dies too soon, who will take care of my son?&#34; Bianca walked over, smug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only could she take Mia&#39;s place, but she could also transfer all of Mia&#39;s wealth to her own son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a dream come true for her. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll let your daughter live a couple more years. Once we transfer all your assets, we&#39;ll send your whole family to hell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aiden, how could you be such a bastard?&#34; Mia trembled all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never imagined that marrying Aiden, the wrong man, would bring such disaster to her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the sake of our marriage, I beg you, don&#39;t harm my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your parents still don&#39;t trust me and won&#39;t hand over the company. They deserve it,&#34; Aiden said, feeling no remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca urged him, &#34;Stop wasting time. Kill her quickly so we can leave. I don&#39;t want to end up in jail if someone sees us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s pitch dark, and there are no cameras at sea. If the police ask, we&#39;ll say Mia fell into the sea trying to save her daughter and got eaten by sharks. No evidence, no case. Who will know the truth?&#34; Aiden said smugly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already thought of everything and was confident nothing would go wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Bianca was still uneasy. &#34;Hurry up and throw them overboard. The sooner, the better. Then I&#39;ll tell the captain to head back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aiden walked over to the two women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned wickedly and reached for Mia. Mia screamed in despair, and Christina called out desperately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The louder they screamed, the more pleasure Aiden felt. &#34;Scream all you want. Do you think anyone will come to save you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using his strength, he dragged the chair-bound Mia to the edge of the deck and pushed her overboard, chair and all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next, it was Christina&#39;s turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aiden didn&#39;t push her immediately. Instead, he reached out and touched her face.</p>
