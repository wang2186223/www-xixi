                <p>Christina took a deep breath and pushed those unrealistic thoughts out of her mind. She needed to focus on her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her design progress had been decent before, but various reasons had caused delays. So, Christina had to start from scratch. Thankfully, Mia hadn&#39;t given up. Christina couldn&#39;t even imagine what would have happened otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just finished drawing the latest design and sent it over to Mia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia replied shortly after reviewing the design, &#34;I was just about to come find you. Are you free?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m at the office,&#34; Christina responded, continuing to work on her designs. She wanted to immerse herself in work to improve her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During this time, William kept calling and texting her. He wanted a response or forgiveness from Christina. But she had blocked him without even looking at his messages. There was no way she was going to reply or forgive him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing her second design, Mia arrived at the office and called Christina into her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were friends now, so Christina didn&#39;t use formal titles with her. She had tried once, but Mia had sternly corrected her, and they had been like sisters ever since.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re amazing. Truly talented people won&#39;t be overlooked, no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina felt a bit embarrassed by the compliment. &#34;I was hoping you&#39;d point out any issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia looked at the designs, growing more satisfied with each one. &#34;No need. I think they&#39;re perfect as they are. Any more changes would be unnecessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia placed the designs on the table and pulled a file from the drawer, handing it to Christina. Christina instinctively took it and opened it, shocked by the contents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this? A stock transfer? Did you grab the wrong file?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia shook her head with a smile. &#34;No mistake. It&#39;s still early. Come with me somewhere?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina checked the time. It was indeed early. She agreed to Mia&#39;s invitation, and they headed to Silver Lake Hot Springs Resort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are we here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you needed a break. I&#39;ve heard about my brother&#39;s situation. I can&#39;t believe he can&#39;t even handle his own affairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia had hoped to set up Alex and Christina. But it had to be mutual. After all, Mia herself was a living example, and Christina clearly wasn&#39;t interested. But her naive brother Alex still thought there was hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, but if something like this happens again, let&#39;s handle it at the office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t blame Mia. But too many incidents like this would be too much for anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was his fault. Don&#39;t worry, Alex knows he messed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hope you&#39;re not mad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shook her head. She remembered the stock transfer document.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That stock transfer is for you. Just a preview. I&#39;ll send you the details later,&#34; Mia explained while driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was puzzled, looking at Mia. &#34;You&#39;ve helped me so much. I need to show my gratitude. You&#39;ve put in so much effort, I feel bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia was sincere. If it were anyone else, Mia might not have been so direct. But this was different. Christina had truly helped her a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina felt awkward. &#34;Don&#39;t make it complicated. I was just doing what felt right. I think I helped not just you, but many women.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina meant that she would have helped any woman in Mia&#39;s situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you helped me. I can&#39;t ignore that just because you might help others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They went back and forth. Christina felt a bit helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, I won&#39;t accept your stocks. If you want to give me something, make it practical.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spend more time with me, talk to me. What I need isn&#39;t stocks, but genuine friendship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia was deeply moved. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, they arrived at their destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this place?&#34; Christina had noticed earlier. Mia&#39;s GPS was set to a resort. Christina thought Mia was taking her to a business meeting, but they were at Silver Lake Hot Springs Resort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here to relax in the hot springs. Don&#39;t worry about swimsuits. I&#39;ve got everything covered. I noticed you&#39;ve been stressed, so let&#39;s take this chance to unwind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia led Christina inside. Christina felt a bit awkward. &#34;I&#39;m not really in the mood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it your period?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No worries, I have tampons...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Mia noticed Christina&#39;s expression. &#34;Wait, are you...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina waved her hand. &#34;No, it&#39;s nothing. I&#39;ll just keep you company. It&#39;s warm inside, we can chat while you soak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia nodded, not pressing further. But as they reached the entrance, Mia suddenly remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you pregnant? Is that why you went to the hospital? No wonder you weren&#39;t interested in my brother. You already have a baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia&#39;s teasing made Christina feel awkward. She couldn&#39;t exactly tell Mia she was reborn. But it didn&#39;t matter. Christina wanted to keep the baby, not because of anyone else, but because she wanted the child to live. Even if she wanted to cut ties with William, Christina wanted to keep the baby and live well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I won&#39;t push you. You need to be careful in the first few months. I won&#39;t force you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina nodded awkwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they reached the changing area, they saw a group of people approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One person stood out, tall and well-dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina recognized him immediately. William and his group noticed them too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he looked up, his eyes met Christina&#39;s. Seeing her, he instinctively walked over. He didn&#39;t bother explaining to anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing William approach, Christina instinctively stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mia, being sharp, noticed the tension between them. But when she realized it was William, she was still a bit shocked.</p>
