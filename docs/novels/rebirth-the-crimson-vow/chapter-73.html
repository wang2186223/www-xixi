                <p>Christina was startled by the sudden movement. She turned her head and was shocked to see William standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle, what are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s eyes began to glaze over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently lifted her chin and passionately kissed her on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything happened so quickly that Christina didn&#39;t even have time to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind went blank, and she could only think of one thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is he doing? Why is he kissing me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually, her rationality returned. She widened her eyes and pushed him away forcefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle, what are you doing? Did you mistake me for someone else? Let go of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clearly hadn&#39;t mistaken her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina overlooked the fact that he had called her name as he approached, grabbed her, and pulled her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s grip was strong, and his gaze was intensely passionate, as if he wanted to devour her right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s hands flailed wildly, and she suddenly felt a decorative object on the hallway wall. She grabbed it and struck William hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he didn&#39;t pass out, he staggered back a few steps, leaning against the wall in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was low and seductive, like a lover&#39;s gentle call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina got goosebumps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle, you&#39;re burning up. Are you running a fever? Let me call Bob to come get you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina turned away and used her phone to contact Bob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t notice Jennifer standing at the corner of the hallway, watching everything unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer bit her lip tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wasn&#39;t mistaken, William hadn&#39;t confused Christina with someone else. He had called her name and kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy surged within Jennifer, making her feel both bitter and sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After confirming the location and time with Bob, Christina turned back to check on William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to help you to a place to rest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seeing him so out of it, she hesitated to get too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she wavered, someone suddenly rushed out from behind her. Jennifer ran over, exclaiming, &#34;Mr. Cavendish, are you okay? You don&#39;t look well!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was barely holding on, trying to maintain his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer frowned and turned to scold Christina, &#34;Mr. Cavendish clearly isn&#39;t well, and you left him in the hallway. What are you thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know where to take him,&#34; Christina replied, her voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Couldn&#39;t you have come to find me? Have you forgotten I&#39;m Mr. Cavendish&#39;s fiancée?&#34; Jennifer&#39;s frown deepened, her words pointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering what had just happened, Christina felt at a loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Bob arrived, sweating profusely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Cavendish, are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William closed his eyes in pain. &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob sighed in relief and quickly helped him up, supporting him on his shoulder. &#34;Mr. Cavendish, I&#39;ll take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer immediately followed. &#34;I&#39;ll come with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long night of injections and IV fluids, William&#39;s fever finally subsided a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was exhausted, as if he had been through a severe illness, completely drained of energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Christina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked Bob, who was standing nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the door, Jennifer, holding a bowl of soup, froze upon hearing his question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She left after handing you over to me. She probably had something to do. Mr. Cavendish, about tonight...&#34; Bob hesitated, fearing William&#39;s anger, and quickly changed the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He dared to mess with me. He&#39;s got a death wish.&#34; William&#39;s eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This matter needed to be thoroughly investigated, and Bob understood, immediately agreeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that they no longer mentioned Christina, Jennifer quickly entered the room and placed the soup on the bedside table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This will help cool you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer sighed, wetting a towel with cool water and wiping his forehead. &#34;Mr. Cavendish, it&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re strong. You pulled through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William remained expressionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s late. You should go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can I leave when something like this happened to you? Let me stay and take care of you,&#34; Jennifer insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s tone was indifferent. &#34;No need. Go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was practically dismissing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer felt a sudden sense of urgency, recalling the events of the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t do something, her past act of saving William&#39;s life would soon be forgotten, especially with his growing interest in Christina!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t just stand by and do nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll leave after I finish with the soup. Rest well, and I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&#34; Jennifer nodded obediently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left the bedroom, her face turning grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, she had to take action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to use an old trick. William was a man who repaid his debts. It was because of her past act of saving his life that she had everything she did now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of thought, she devised a plan. She went to a nearby room and set up a delayed short-circuit device by the curtains, following instructions she found online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, she turned on the central air conditioning and other high-power appliances in the room. This way, at night, the short circuit would create sparks that could ignite the curtains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt she had no choice but to do this. She didn&#39;t leave but waited quietly in her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was feeling much better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go now. Make sure to investigate this thoroughly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob nodded. &#34;Yes, Mr. Cavendish. Rest well. I&#39;ll be back in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William said nothing, closing his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer waited for over an hour. The window she had targeted began to show signs of fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t rush. The flames were still small and not yet dangerous enough to be memorable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes, the flames grew, and the fire started to spread. Jennifer then got out of her car and rushed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fire was bigger than she had anticipated. The second-floor hallway was filled with thick smoke, making it hard to see. She covered her mouth and nose with her sleeve and called out urgently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Cavendish, where are you? Mr. Cavendish!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy cough came from the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart leaped with joy, and she hurried forward, pounding on the door. &#34;Mr. Cavendish, are you in there?&#34;</p>
