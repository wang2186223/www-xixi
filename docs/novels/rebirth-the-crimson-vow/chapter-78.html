                <p>They had just arrived at the private room and hadn&#39;t even taken their seats when people started trickling in.</p>

                <p>It seemed like Ethan and William were quite familiar with each other. Ethan casually slung an arm around William&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Come on, everyone&#39;s been waiting for you. Have a seat.&#34;</p>

                <p>Ethan introduced her with a smile, &#34;Let me introduce you. This is Christina, one of Kelvin&#39;s students. She&#39;s handling the project we&#39;re working on. She&#39;s quite capable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; William glanced at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stood up and poured drinks for everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you all can look out for me. I&#39;m the least experienced among Kelvin&#39;s students, so I appreciate your trust. This drink is for all of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she downed her drink in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sincerity was clear, making the rest of the evening easier to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of everyone, William didn&#39;t give her any face. Instead, he took out a cigarette but didn&#39;t light it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan called out, &#34;The lighter&#39;s right in front of you. Light his cigarette.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina knew he was deliberately targeting her. She took a deep breath, suppressing her frustration. For the sake of her job and career, she picked up the lighter and walked over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she lit the flame, William took a deep drag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the swirling smoke, his expression was unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He casually flicked the ash, and it seemed to drift intentionally towards Christina&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Christina quickly patted it out, but her shirt was still singed with a small black mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I didn&#39;t notice,&#34; William said nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone made it hard to believe it wasn&#39;t intentional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina suppressed her anger and smiled faintly. &#34;It&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll go clean up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was really too much! But the deal was almost closed, and she didn&#39;t want to jeopardize it because of her own issues. She couldn&#39;t face Kelvin if she messed this up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside, she finally felt like she could breathe again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan sensed something off between them and raised an eyebrow. &#34;Do you two know each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; William replied coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan didn&#39;t press further and lifted his glass. &#34;Come on, let&#39;s drink. It&#39;s rare for us to get together. Let&#39;s not leave until we&#39;re drunk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William put down his glass and stood up. &#34;I&#39;ll be right back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Ethan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But William didn&#39;t answer and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina splashed some water on her face and grabbed a tissue to clean the brown stain on her shirt. Though it wasn&#39;t burned through, the mark was quite noticeable on the white fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath to calm herself. Just as she was about to leave, she saw William in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William closed the door behind him and, before she could react, pinned her against the sink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you doing?&#34; Christina looked up at him coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s eyes were probing, dark and deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it a coincidence that you keep showing up around me, Christina? What are you after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re overthinking it,&#34; Christina glanced at him. &#34;Ethan is my client. How was I supposed to know you two knew each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t know?&#34; William&#39;s eyes filled with anger. &#34;Is it really that coincidental?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had known he would be at this gathering, she would have found any excuse to avoid it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her previous life, the distance between her and William was like a galaxy. She had no idea who was in his circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe what you want. I don&#39;t owe you an explanation. Let go of me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina struggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was much stronger, and she was no match for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, William?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stomped on his foot and even tried to scratch his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William just looked at her coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want people to know we have a connection, go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s hand froze in mid-air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe how unreasonable William was. He pushed her away, but when she left, he kept coming after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Ethan&#39;s voice came from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William, are you in the restroom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men&#39;s restroom was right next door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they both came out of the women&#39;s restroom, it would definitely raise questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina glared at him. &#34;I&#39;ll go deal with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William watched her with amusement, as if he didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing he wasn&#39;t going to stop her, Christina breathed a sigh of relief, opened the door, and quickly walked out. &#34;Mr. Fisher, I didn&#39;t hear anyone come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s head back to the room,&#34; Ethan said, not suspecting a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they returned to the room, William came back too. Ethan asked where he had been, but William just drank his wine without answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dinner ended quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they left, William glanced at her. &#34;Get in the car. I&#39;ll give you a ride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina frowned. She didn&#39;t want to be associated with him at all. &#34;No need. It&#39;s out of your way. I need to go back to school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have to go back to school that night, but she didn&#39;t want to share a car with William. Plus, she needed to pick up something important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t argue, just ordered coldly, &#34;Get in the car. Don&#39;t make me repeat myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his attitude, Christina didn&#39;t want to argue in public. She opened the back door and got in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t start the car, just glared at her. &#34;Do you think I&#39;m your chauffeur?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina took a deep breath, suppressing her anger, and moved to the front seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With graduation approaching, the dorm was almost empty. She quickly found the brooch her father had left her, something very important to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William waited downstairs. Just as she reached for the door handle, Missy appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back at school today? Why didn&#39;t you say anything?&#34;</p>
