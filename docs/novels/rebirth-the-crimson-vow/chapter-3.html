                <p>&#34;I have no evidence, and I don&#39;t need any evidence!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s tone was gentle, yet inexplicably carried a forceful strength. &#34;How could I know about something I wasn&#39;t involved in? If you insist on me saying, then I think it&#39;s her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her slender finger pointed at Jennifer, who was sitting beside William with a resentful expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s expression froze, seemingly unable to react to Christina pointing at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But soon, she adjusted her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been engaged to William for several years, but William had never mentioned marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she thought it was because the Cavendish family disapproved, but back then, the Cavendish family also disapproved of him being with her, yet he still firmly chose to stand by her side. Why couldn&#39;t he do it this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s attitude made Jennifer feel a sense of crisis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She panicked, which is why she drugged William, hoping that after making love, she could force him into marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t expect Christina, that bitch, to take advantage of it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now that Christina admitted it was her, if she took the initiative to admit it, she might still succeed in forcing the marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer glanced at William, then got up and walked to Nicholas, bending her knee and kneeling directly in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could speak, tears started to fall, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Nicholas, I was forced and had no other choice. I know you look down on my background, but I truly love William, which is why I resorted to such a desperate measure! The diary was written by me, and the person the paparazzi photographed was also me. It&#39;s just that because Christina and I are similar in height and build, it caused a misunderstanding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One had to admit, Jennifer&#39;s acting was really good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That look of unrequited love and helplessness was portrayed very vividly by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was to the point where those who heard it would be moved to tears, and those who saw it would feel heartbroken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina watched from the side, unable to help but sigh inwardly. No wonder William was so infatuated with Jennifer in her past life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had even half of Jennifer&#39;s acting skills, she wouldn&#39;t have lost so miserably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You say it&#39;s you, then why didn&#39;t you admit it earlier?&#34; Nicholas looked at her coldly, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s heart raced, but she still maintained a sorrowful and mournful look, &#34;I didn&#39;t dare to. I was afraid William would look down on me because of it, and even more afraid that you would think I was not self-respecting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like she was willing to endure any grievance for love, even Christina couldn&#39;t help but be moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina slowly curled her lips, &#34;Since it&#39;s now proven that I&#39;m innocent, and Jennifer is Uncle&#39;s fiancée, Grandpa might as well fulfill their wish. Announce the truth to the public and let them get married. The rumors online will naturally be dispelled!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this life, she chose to step back and fulfill their love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to see what William&#39;s reaction would be when he finally saw Jennifer&#39;s true colors one day!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for what Nicholas ultimately decided about Jennifer, Christina didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After clarifying that the matter had nothing to do with her, Christina found an excuse to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dark, Elisa returned with a very unpleasant expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she entered, she poked Christina&#39;s forehead hard with a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you give up such a golden opportunity? The online rumors have been stirred up so much. If you had just said that you were the one with William that night, your grandfather would have definitely made William marry you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s head tilted from the poke, &#34;And then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then? Then you would become Mrs. Cavendish, and you would never have to worry about food and clothing for the rest of your life. Many happy days would be waiting for you!&#34; Elisa said matter-of-factly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William was the future head of the Cavendish family. If Christina really married him, with his support, not only would she and her mother be able to hold their heads high in the Cavendish family, but also in the entire Rexington.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina knew what her mother was thinking, and she also knew that her mother was scheming for her sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina couldn&#39;t blame her, but she also couldn&#39;t agree with what she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because in her past life, she had painfully proven with bloody reality how miserable those so-called &#34;good days&#34; were!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She mercilessly shattered Elisa&#39;s beautiful fantasy, &#34;Mom, I wasn&#39;t the one!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa was stunned, then her face darkened, &#34;You can fool others, but you can&#39;t fool me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she suddenly grabbed Christina&#39;s collar and pulled it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, the bruises on Christina&#39;s delicate skin were exposed to the air, and her expression changed slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa pointed at the bruises, &#34;I&#39;m experienced. Do you think I don&#39;t know what these marks on your body mean? Even though you tried to be quiet when you came back that night to avoid waking us, I still knew. Why didn&#39;t you cherish such a great opportunity and instead pushed it to that scheming woman Jennifer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina looked at her mother in surprise, not because her mother discovered what happened that night, but because she saw through Jennifer&#39;s disguise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, even someone as wise as William was played by Jennifer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina adjusted her collar, &#34;Mom, do you really think I would have a good life if I married William?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Marrying William wouldn&#39;t be good? Then what would be good?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina said, &#34;In their eyes, I&#39;m just a burden you brought. Drugging the future head of the Cavendish family to force him into marriage, and most importantly, the other party is my nominal uncle. Not to mention the Cavendish family, even the outside world&#39;s insults would be enough to make my life miserable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, then spoke the most crucial reason with difficulty, &#34;Moreover, William only loves Jennifer. If he can&#39;t marry the one he loves because of me, do you think he would let me go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa was stunned, choked for a long time, and squeezed out, &#34;But I&#39;m tired of living a life where I have to look at others&#39; faces. Why can&#39;t you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t!&#34; Christina&#39;s tone was firm, &#34;Unless you have the guts to force William to marry me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa&#39;s mouth moved, but she didn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that she had temporarily given up the idea, Christina breathed a sigh of relief and collapsed on the sofa, &#34;Mom, can you help me buy some medicine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Medicine? Are you not feeling well?&#34; Elisa immediately squatted in front of her with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s heart softened, &#34;No, it&#39;s birth control pills.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa immediately understood, looking at Christina with a complicated expression, and finally only said, &#34;What are you after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina placed her hand on her lower abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she really wanted to help William because she loved him and couldn&#39;t bear to see him suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, it was because of a tiny bit of hope in her heart, longing for the day when her dream would come true, so she desperately tried to grasp that one possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the end, when William cruelly took Harper&#39;s kidney for his and Jennifer&#39;s illegitimate child, causing her to die from infection, she finally woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some people were never meant to be loved or desired by her from the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So in this life, she didn&#39;t want it, didn&#39;t ask for it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loved Harper, but she couldn&#39;t selfishly bring her into such a cold and cruel world again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sorry, Harper, please forgive your mother&#39;s selfishness and weakness!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this life, please find different parents!</p>
