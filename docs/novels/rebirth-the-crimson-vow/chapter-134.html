                <p>The driver didn&#39;t even bother getting out of the car; he just sped off, leaving the accident scene behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit her that this wasn&#39;t some old trick being replayed but a deliberate attempt to hurt her. The previous accident involving William had made her let her guard down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only person who could know all this, besides Jennifer, was no one else she could think of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Passersby were horrified by the scene. Some good Samaritans immediately pulled out their phones to call the police, while others called for an ambulance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Christina woke up again, three whole days had passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa was in the hospital room, her tears nearly dried up from crying. She kept asking the doctor over and over, &#34;The surgery&#39;s done, right? And you said it was successful. So why hasn&#39;t my daughter woken up yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand your concern, but a successful surgery doesn&#39;t mean the patient will recover immediately. She still needs to get through the critical post-surgery period,&#34; the doctor tried to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Elisa couldn&#39;t hear any of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only cared about one thing, &#34;Then tell me, when exactly will my daughter wake up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t give a precise answer to that. We just have to be patient. She might wake up today,&#34; the doctor said, trying to comfort her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Elisa had had enough of these vague answers. &#34;You&#39;re doctors, aren&#39;t you? How can you not know when my daughter will wake up? I want to transfer her to another hospital. I want a better specialist for my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her eyes, life had just started to get back on track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina had stopped talking about leaving the Cavendish family, and she had been staying at William&#39;s villa for the past few days. Soon, they could have their wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Nicholas personally overseeing everything, no one would dare say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her daughter had suddenly been in a car accident, lying in a coma for three days with no sign of waking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Transferring her is an option, but as a doctor, I don&#39;t recommend it right now. Your daughter needs rest,&#34; the doctor tried to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa cut him off, &#34;Either you wake my daughter up now, or you shut up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor, you should go. I&#39;ll talk to her,&#34; William couldn&#39;t stand it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the doctor left, he walked over to Elisa. &#34;This is the best hospital in the country, with the best specialists. Christina will wake up. She&#39;s just sleeping now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t just saying this to comfort Elisa; he was also trying to reassure himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he got the call and rushed to the hospital, seeing Christina lying in a pool of blood, he had panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t imagine what he would do if he lost Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could wake up, even if she still hated him as much as before, he would accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he wanted now was for her to wake up, nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;William, what am I supposed to do? I can&#39;t do anything but watch. I&#39;m too scared to even touch my daughter,&#34; Elisa sobbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was hooked up to tubes, with machines monitoring her vitals. What mother wouldn&#39;t be heartbroken seeing this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll wait a little longer. I have a feeling Christina will wake up today,&#34; William said, handing Elisa a tissue. &#34;You need to be strong now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I need to be strong,&#34; Elisa murmured, wiping her tears, which only seemed to flow more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As William reached for another tissue, Christina&#39;s eyelids fluttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze, staring at Christina, filled with hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she waking up, or was it just his imagination?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, Christina opened her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard the crying beside her and saw the two people in front of her, feeling everything was so unfamiliar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake?&#34; William couldn&#39;t contain his excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t dreaming or imagining things; Christina was really awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This meant she had passed the critical period and would be okay. He wouldn&#39;t lose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina?&#34; Elisa looked up and met her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the emotions she had been holding back burst out as she hugged Christina tightly, tears streaming down. &#34;You&#39;re finally awake. You have no idea how these three days have been for me. I wanted to pass out with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was confused by her sudden warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind was blank, like a baby learning to walk, everything around her unfamiliar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t recognize the two people in front of her, but their excitement suggested they knew her well. &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Christina, are you joking? Don&#39;t joke like this,&#34; Elisa trembled uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could this be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Christina not know who they were?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William initially thought Christina was joking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then he saw the confusion in her eyes, devoid of the love and hate she once had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could act that well, and Christina hated him too much to lie at a time like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve lost your memory, haven&#39;t you?&#34; William asked, though his tone was certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina nodded. &#34;I can&#39;t remember anything. I don&#39;t know who you are or why I&#39;m here. Can you tell me what our relationship is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa snapped out of it and ran out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurriedly called the doctor, &#34;My daughter is awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s great news. Waking up means she&#39;s out of danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she doesn&#39;t remember anything, not even me, her mother. What&#39;s going on?&#34; Elisa grabbed the doctor&#39;s arm. &#34;Doctor, please help my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she had been harsh before, for a cancer patient who had just come to terms with her illness, only to face her daughter&#39;s accident and uncertain fate, it was too much to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor understood and didn&#39;t hold it against her. &#34;Your daughter has a blood clot in her head, which might be causing temporary or permanent amnesia. We&#39;ll need to treat her to find out more.&#34;</p>
