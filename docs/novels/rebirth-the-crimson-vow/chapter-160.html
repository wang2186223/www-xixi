                <p>A few days later, Christina got a bunch of messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were from her class president, Tony Gibson: &#34;Christina, our old teacher Mr. Ralph Cook passed away suddenly. His funeral is tomorrow. Can you make it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whether you can come or not, please let me know. I need to get a headcount.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s first reaction was disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralph was only in his thirties, in the prime of his life. How could he have died?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even thought it might be a cruel joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the message was from Tony, so to be sure, she decided to ask: &#34;When did this happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two days ago. Mr. Ralph Cook had a heart attack while staying up late grading papers. He was rushed to the hospital but didn&#39;t make it. His obituary is already on Facebook.&#34; Tony replied quickly, clearly holding his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even sent a screenshot of the obituary to Christina: &#34;I know it&#39;s hard to believe. When I first heard the news, I thought it was fake too. But it&#39;s true. As his students, the least we can do is be there for his final journey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be there on time,&#34; Christina replied, staring at her phone screen, feeling a heavy weight in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her previous life, she remembered Ralph didn&#39;t die so young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe her rebirth caused a butterfly effect, changing everyone&#39;s life paths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why could she change others&#39; lives but not her own?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what about her Harper...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about this made her even more upset, so she decided to sleep, hoping to numb herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that night, she tossed and turned, unable to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Christina got up early. Since she was going to a funeral, she didn&#39;t dress up, choosing a black and white outfit from her closet and heading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The funeral was held at the cemetery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she got out of the car, she immediately saw Tony standing outside. She walked over to greet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go. I&#39;ll take you in,&#34; Tony said, leading her inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere between them was heavy and somber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they even reached Ralph&#39;s grave, they heard heart-wrenching cries ahead. Just hearing the sound, one could imagine the pain the person was in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Blair Cook must have cried all night. Her eyes are swollen, and Ralph&#39;s two kids have been calling for their dad. They only quieted down because they got tired,&#34; Tony said, stopping, his eyes filled with sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As students, they couldn&#39;t accept Ralph&#39;s sudden death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Ralph&#39;s family, his wife and kids, accept it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina sighed heavily, &#34;Ralph was so responsible. He cared deeply for every student, even the most troublesome ones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Ralph hadn&#39;t been so dedicated, if he had just gone home after work without worrying about students failing, he might not have died so young.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony sighed too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing them approach, Blair stood up, wiped her tears, and forced a smile that looked more painful than crying. &#34;You must be his students. I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not in the best mood today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Cook, we&#39;re here to pay our respects to Ralph. Please, don&#39;t worry about us. Try not to be too sad,&#34; Christina said, trying to comfort her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a way, Christina could empathize with Blair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her past life, when she lost her daughter, the pain was indescribable. Losing a loved one is the greatest pain in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lost her daughter, and Blair lost her husband. The two kids lost their father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stayed by Blair&#39;s side, helping to comfort the children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sis, is my dad never coming back? They say my dad is dead. What does dead mean?&#34; the little girl asked, clutching Christina&#39;s clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so pitiful and helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina picked her up and gently comforted her, &#34;Your dad has gone to a faraway place and can&#39;t come back for now, but he will always protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t Dad miss us?&#34; the little girl continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course he does,&#34; Christina said softly, wiping away her tears. &#34;That&#39;s why he will always watch over you. You need to grow up well and take care of your mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; the little girl nodded firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would wait for the day her dad returned and show him that she and her brother were good kids and that their mom was doing well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, other classmates arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer found Missy in the crowd and pulled her aside, lowering her voice, &#34;Did you prepare everything I asked for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but there are so many people today. I&#39;m a bit scared,&#34; Missy said, feeling nervous about doing something like this for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she knew that once she agreed to Jennifer&#39;s plan, there was no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer could help her leave Emerald Lakeside and live the high-society life she dreamed of, but she could also destroy her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you afraid of? I&#39;ve arranged everything. Just do as I say, and there won&#39;t be any problems,&#34; Jennifer said, frowning. &#34;Don&#39;t back out now. Doesn&#39;t your family need money for medicine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That money was crucial. Without Jennifer&#39;s help, Missy couldn&#39;t earn enough even if she worked around the clock as a waitress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Missy couldn&#39;t just watch her family suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do as you say. But if William finds out, will you help me?&#34; Missy asked, gripping Jennifer&#39;s hand tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer frowned deeper, &#34;William is on my side. We&#39;re getting married. You don&#39;t need to worry about that. I&#39;ll handle everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Jennifer&#39;s assurance, Missy felt more at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blended in with the crowd, attending the funeral without raising any suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the funeral, everyone went to a hotel for a meal. Missy took the opportunity to slip out of the banquet hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a small bottle from her bag, containing a colorless, odorless drug she had bought from the black market. Just one drop would make someone extremely agitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Christina being humiliated in front of everyone, her reputation destroyed, filled Missy with a twisted sense of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t so arrogant now, was she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After today, let&#39;s see how Christina could still act high and mighty!</p>
