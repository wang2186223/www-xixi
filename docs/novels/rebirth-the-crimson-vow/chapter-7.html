                <p>Christina remained calm, &#34;I&#39;m not a child of the Cavendish family. Now that I&#39;ve left the Cavendish Mansion, it&#39;s impossible for me to still cling to you, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s eyes darkened upon hearing this. He reached out and grabbed Christina&#39;s neck, &#34;Are you saying that I need to cling to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were filled with endless coldness and ferocity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina knew she was in great danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I&#39;m saying is the truth!&#34; Christina gritted her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s fingers tightened instantly, and Christina felt like she was about to suffocate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William coldly reprimanded, &#34;You leave the Cavendish Mansion at this critical moment, sever ties with the Cavendish family, causing the public to criticize the Cavendish family, and a few months later, you show up with a pregnant belly, is that it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina instinctively struggled, but she was no match for William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face turned red, and her nose felt sore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to die!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding onto this belief, Christina kept waving her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bang!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was thrown to the floor by William, &#34;Bob, pull over and get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob responded quickly, and the next second, the car stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William leaned slightly, and a large hand reached over to grab Christina&#39;s wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was thrown back onto the seat by William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bang!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head hit the window, and it hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina saw the scratch marks on William&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want from me?&#34; She had already deviated from the path of her previous life. She just wanted to avoid William, to stay away from the Cavendish family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was that not possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William seemed to hear the biggest joke in the world. He coldly sneered, &#34;Let you go? Christina, you provoked me. You want to affect the Cavendish family, to deceive us, that&#39;s impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina realized the danger and immediately tried to open the car door, but William&#39;s hand slapped against the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her escape plan failed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William reclined the front seat, grabbed the back of Christina&#39;s shirt, and lifted her onto his lap like a small chicken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was facing away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina instinctively struggled, but the strength difference between men and women was significant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her proud back was forcefully pressed down by William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, under William&#39;s force, her naked body was exposed, the red marks on her skin were so obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were all left by him last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina continued to struggle, &#34;Last night was an accident. If you dare touch me today, it will be rape!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina knew William&#39;s methods, but she was not willing to be humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the long years of her previous life, William believed she had drugged him, and later, under public pressure, he married her. Her humility and attempts to please him never won William&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time William made love to her, it was to punish her. She couldn&#39;t see his face, and it was always in the most humiliating way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s whole body trembled uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an instinctive aversion, and an endless sorrow deep in her heart!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William hated being threatened the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gripped Christina&#39;s waist, his lips curling into a cold smile, &#34;Then let&#39;s see how you call the police to arrest me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was still the Cavendish family&#39;s territory. Who would dare check his luxury car?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, his assistant Bob had already gotten out of the car and was standing guard not far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gritted her teeth, enduring the humiliation, a plan forming in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But William didn&#39;t give her a chance to get out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After William finished punishing her, he grabbed her wrist and called Bob, &#34;Come back and drive, head towards Misthaven Manor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In less than a minute, Bob returned to drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina knew she couldn&#39;t jump out of the car, and she certainly wouldn&#39;t risk her life. She could only follow William to the destination and then think of a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, William held her hand tightly, trying to drag her out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina said coldly, &#34;Mr. Cavendish, your place is so well-guarded, I don&#39;t have three heads and six arms, I&#39;m not as powerful as you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t say anything, his cold gaze falling on Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, after being drugged, Christina went from struggling to being proactive, from being shy to being passionate. William hadn&#39;t forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, Christina was so cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are the best actress I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s evaluation of her was as disdainful as in her previous life. But she was no longer the Christina of her previous life; she had awakened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sneered sarcastically, &#34;I&#39;m such a good actress, what about you? Aren&#39;t you also two-faced, saying one moment that I&#39;m malicious, deceiving and scheming against you, and the next moment wanting to make love to me. William, you&#39;re so perverted, no wonder no woman stays by your side!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob behind them was shocked!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was utterly dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this still the timid, stammering burden of the Cavendish family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she said these things in front of Mr. William Cavendish, did she have a death wish?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s grip tightened, and Christina felt her wrist was about to be crushed, but she didn&#39;t cry out in pain, nor did she make any move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina even smiled at William, &#34;Angry out of shame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think reverse psychology will make me let you go?&#34; William&#39;s thin lips moved coldly, &#34;For the next few months, you will stay here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, are you planning to hide me secretly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Originally, she thought that after what happened last night, she had completely distanced herself from William. But unexpectedly, William was unwilling to let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, people she hated should all die!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she couldn&#39;t have peace, neither should he.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a &#34;crack,&#34; intense pain spread from her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s hand was broken by William, who then threw her aside, &#34;You better think carefully about how to talk to me to ensure you don&#39;t die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, William turned around, his cold eyes sweeping towards Bob, &#34;Give the order, keep a close watch on her. If she escapes, none of you will live.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s voice was cold and devoid of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with his ruthless methods, Christina knew William could do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, someone came to take her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Windsor, come with me. I&#39;ll take you to your room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room William arranged for her was just an ordinary guest room, but it was well-equipped with air conditioning, a washing machine, and a water dispenser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this information age, Christina went online and made an appointment with a doctor. Her hand was broken by William, and she didn&#39;t want to end up with a disabled left hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, on William&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob stood in front of him, hesitating for a long time before finally speaking, &#34;Mr. Cavendish, keeping Christina here might not be a good idea, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Elisa still belonged to the Cavendish family, as William&#39;s third brother&#39;s wife, Christina should call him uncle!</p>
