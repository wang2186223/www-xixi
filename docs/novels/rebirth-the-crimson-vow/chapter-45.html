                <p>&#34;Our boss naturally has his own considerations.&#34; James took a sip of coffee, his deep eyes obscured by the steam, revealing no emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina nodded knowingly and didn&#39;t delve further into the matter. Instead, she took out a pen and paper and asked seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, what kind of design style does your company want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James pondered for a moment before speaking slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We want a commercial district that has a modern feel but doesn&#39;t lose its traditional charm. It should attract customers of different age groups and have enough cultural depth and commercial vitality.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s pen paused slightly, and she showed an awkward but polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This concept seems quite vague.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, our boss just won the bid for this project a few days ago. To be honest, he doesn&#39;t have a specific idea yet; he just wants to create a commercial district.&#34; James spread his hands, indicating his helplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was stunned for a moment, feeling that something was odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there&#39;s plenty of time, why not take your time to find a designer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s because you just won the gold award, and people must be flocking to you. If we don&#39;t book your schedule in advance, we might not be able to book you later.&#34; James candidly explained the reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina felt a bit embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she wasn&#39;t exactly in high demand, she wasn&#39;t completely without clients either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The concern he mentioned was unlikely to happen in the short term.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t be a problem. If you are sure you want to collaborate with our architectural firm, we can draft a preliminary contract, and I&#39;ll keep my schedule open.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, that&#39;s no problem.&#34; James laughed, &#34;As long as you agree, we can discuss the subsequent conditions slowly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was a bit unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did she feel that he was more anxious than she was?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she couldn&#39;t figure out the reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hesitating for a moment, she asked, &#34;Alright, before we officially sign the contract, can I meet your boss to discuss the specific ideas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; James agreed without hesitation, &#34;I&#39;m just here to check your availability. It&#39;s good that you have time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stood up and poured him a cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s your coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stanley had just arrived at the office when Bruce came over. &#34;Mr. Fisher used to favor you the most, but it seems like that might change now, with the newcomer stealing the spotlight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stanley didn&#39;t say anything. He just tidied up the blueprints on his desk and locked them in the drawer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce felt awkward and was about to leave, but he still leaned in. &#34;Hey, aren&#39;t you going to do something about it? Letting someone like Christina mix in with us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with us? Are we so noble?&#34; Stanley frowned and retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stanley glanced at him and said calmly, &#34;No wonder Mr. Fisher said what he did. You don&#39;t focus on your designs and instead think about these irrelevant things. Is it worth it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck! Stop pretending to be so high and mighty.&#34; Bruce got angry and slammed the table. &#34;Everyone knows you suck up to Mr. Fisher&#39;s granddaughter, and now you&#39;re pretending to be all noble. We&#39;re being nice because you&#39;re one of us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stanley&#39;s actions paused slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce got more agitated. &#34;Look at you. Mr. Fisher used to give you all the dirty and tiring jobs, and now she comes in and gets to design a commercial district right away. Do you think you&#39;ll ever make it into the mainstream design industry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stanley looked up at him. &#34;We&#39;re all doing the work of architects. There&#39;s no high or low.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can fool us with that, but don&#39;t fool yourself.&#34; Bruce sneered. &#34;You&#39;ve been close to Mr. Fisher all this time and haven&#39;t gained any benefits. I really feel sorry for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Kaitlyn appeared out of nowhere, glaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing, Bruce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce&#39;s expression changed instantly, showing a bit of a fawning smile. &#34;I&#39;m just having a chat with Stanley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn put her hands on her hips. &#34;Hmph, no one can bully him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not bullying him.&#34; Bruce glanced at Stanley. &#34;Right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stanley couldn&#39;t be bothered to respond. He packed up the materials in the drawer and quickly left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him ignore her, Kaitlyn stomped her foot in anger and was about to chase after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce quickly called her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, haven&#39;t you noticed that he&#39;s never lost his temper or shown any emotion all these years? Don&#39;t you want to know why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, I don&#39;t care about your petty issues.&#34; Kaitlyn snorted and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruce cleared his throat and said loudly, &#34;It&#39;s all because of that new girl, Christina. We were talking about Christina, not him, but he got upset and started mocking us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaitlyn stopped in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The new girl, Christina. When she brought her grandfather in earlier, Christina was standing right there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina had long hair and was very attractive, standing out among a group of men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be honest, she had never seen Stanley stand up for a girl before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snorted and left angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stanley delivered the materials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glenn had just arrived and greeted him warmly. &#34;Come on, don&#39;t leave. Have a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he looked at Stanley like a big bad wolf eyeing a little rabbit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stanley felt a chill down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin took a sip of his coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a bit difficult to say.&#34; Glenn sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin could see through him. If it were really that difficult, he wouldn&#39;t have said it. Why put on an act in front of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t expose him, nor did he follow Glenn&#39;s lead. He just sipped his coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was filled with an awkward silence. Sure enough, Glenn couldn&#39;t sit still and cleared his throat. &#34;I&#39;m here to ask if I can borrow a few people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Borrow people from me?&#34; Kelvin put down his coffee cup. &#34;You have so many people under you. Why borrow my students?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in a tough spot.&#34; Glenn sighed. &#34;A few days ago, it was reported that a small place in the countryside had discovered medieval buildings in ruins. They said it had restoration value, so they brought a team to restore it to its original appearance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin took a deep breath and frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember you have Manuel Jenkins under you. He can lead a team himself now, and he&#39;s good at this. Why borrow people from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.&#34; Glenn spread his hands, looking helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the problem is, he broke his leg while restoring the ancient buildings. Now, the cultural relics institute doesn&#39;t have any architectural talent and doesn&#39;t dare to start work. They called me to find a solution. My students are abroad, and the others are busy. I really can&#39;t spare anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin thought for a moment. &#34;Indeed, we should strongly support the restoration and protection of ancient cultural relics and buildings.&#34;</p>
