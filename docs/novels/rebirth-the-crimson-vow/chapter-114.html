                <p>William wanted to stay longer at the hospital to spend more time with Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But given his position at the company, there were just too many things that needed his attention. His assistant&#39;s calls kept coming in one after another, and he had to return to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, he repeatedly reminded Christina, &#34;If you need anything, just tell the caregiver. She&#39;ll be here soon. If you feel uncomfortable, press the call button, and the nurse will come right away. I hope the next time I see you, you&#39;ll be in better shape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, yeah, I got it. Just go already,&#34; Christina replied impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t need William&#39;s concern at all right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was he when she needed him in her past life? Having lived through it all again, she had long since accumulated enough disappointment and had no expectations of him. Yet now, he seemed so concerned about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His belated concern was worth less than trash on the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, I meant every word I said. If you harm yourself, the Cavendish family will refuse to provide medical care for your mother. You know her condition. She is your biological mother,&#34; William said, still uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought up Elisa again, trying to use her as a tether to keep Christina in line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s heart had long since grown numb from the pain. She looked up at him, &#34;Nicholas already told me that. You don&#39;t need to repeat it. I&#39;m not an idiot. If you&#39;re leaving, just go. Can you let me have some peace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really hated these threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she had everything she needed here, and Nicholas promised to personally bring her into the family business, losing her freedom made her feel like a caged bird. She couldn&#39;t live like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t say anything more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he left, the caregiver he had arranged arrived. She was a woman in her forties who immediately started tidying up the room. &#34;Ms. Windsor, you can call me Kenna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Christina said, having no particular opinion about the new caregiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she knew very well that William had hurriedly arranged for a caregiver to keep an eye on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of this, it was hard for her to be friendly to Kenna, and her tone was cold. &#34;I&#39;m going out for a bit. I&#39;ll be back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Windsor, your wounds haven&#39;t healed yet. How about I accompany you? I can help if anything happens,&#34; Kenna said, quickly following her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenna was worried about Christina getting into trouble and also feared she might take the opportunity to run away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t want any more complications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Kenna called William, who knew how much more trouble that would cause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going downstairs to see my mom. You can come with me, but wait outside when we get there,&#34; she said, allowing Kenna to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them left the room, and soon Christina took the elevator downstairs. She pushed open the door to find that Raymond had already gone to work, leaving Elisa alone in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, what are you doing here?&#34; Elisa&#39;s first reaction was to persuade her, &#34;You see my condition. If you don&#39;t find a good man to take care of you now, what will you do after I&#39;m gone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m old enough to take care of myself,&#34; Christina replied, though she left one thing unsaid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe everyone thought that if she married William, she would be lucky and have a life of endless blessings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But only she knew how much she had suffered in her past life. So many long nights, she slept holding her child, her tears soaking the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can take care of myself, and I can make money. Buying a car, a house, even covering your medical expenses is no problem. Mom, why can&#39;t you believe in me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you&#39;re at an age where you can&#39;t stay single forever,&#34; Elisa insisted on her own views.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina realized she couldn&#39;t get through to her and decided not to dwell on it. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m planning to leave here. What about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Elisa was willing to leave with her, she would forget the past and earn money with her own hands to cover all of Elisa&#39;s medical expenses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their life might be poorer than staying with the Cavendish family, but at least they would be free and not so oppressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa was stunned for a moment, then disapproved, &#34;Now that I&#39;m married to Raymond and you&#39;re about to marry William, our lives have finally gotten better. And you want to leave the Cavendish family? Are you out of your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve worked so hard to pave the way for you, hoping your life would be easier. And now you want to take me away from here? Are you crazy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa grew more and more agitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been diagnosed with late-stage cancer. Even with the best treatment, I might not live long, maybe just a few years. You&#39;re my daughter, my closest person, and you want to take away the few stable years I have left?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t know what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The freedom she longed for was seen as deliberate troublemaking by her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since I&#39;m married into the Cavendish family, I won&#39;t leave. You should stop causing trouble and don&#39;t make a terminally ill mother worry about you all the time!&#34; Elisa delivered another heavy blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina suddenly felt her visit was in vain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their views were different, and their life plans were completely opposite. She shouldn&#39;t try to change her mother&#39;s mind. &#34;You think staying with the Cavendish family is a happy life, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, this is the life I&#39;ve always dreamed of,&#34; Elisa replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stood up. &#34;Got it. I need to get an IV, so I&#39;ll head back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Elisa didn&#39;t want to leave, so be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her daughter, Christina couldn&#39;t force Elisa to make a choice against her will. She could only take care of herself first and try to look after Elisa as much as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in her own room, Christina lay on the bed, seemingly resting with her eyes closed, but she was actually thinking of a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of Elisa&#39;s illness, she couldn&#39;t break ties with the Cavendish family directly or act recklessly as before. But she couldn&#39;t just compromise either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to find a solution that worked for both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the evening, Kenna came over and asked, &#34;Ms. Windsor, what would you like for dinner? I can go out and get it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not hungry. I&#39;ll skip dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenna persisted, &#34;How about some fruit? I can make a fruit platter for you. You should eat something, even just a little.&#34;</p>
