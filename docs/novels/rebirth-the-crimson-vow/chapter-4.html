                <p>When Elisa came in with the purchased birth control pills, Christina was leaning against the headboard reading a book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The pills are here, take them quickly.&#34; It had been almost forty-eight hours since Christina returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t take them soon, the pills would be useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina had already placed a glass of warm water on the bedside table. Hearing this, she took out a pill and prepared to put it in her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you buy these pills yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not,&#34; Elisa said confidently. &#34;I instructed a servant to buy them. Don&#39;t worry, I asked someone privately, no one knows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she was the wife of the third son of the Cavendish family. Even if her husband was not favored and she was not liked by Nicholas, it would only bring disgrace to the Cavendish family if it got out that she had to buy something herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the Cavendish family lost their dignity, Nicholas would only be angrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa would never be so foolish as to do such a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Christina felt a bit relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put the pill in her mouth and took a big gulp of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she had made up her mind, her heart still felt like it was being squeezed, the pain almost bringing her to tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her well-behaved and sensible daughter would never be able to exist in this lifetime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she also didn&#39;t want her Harper to get entangled in the dirty Cavendish family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m sorry, Harper!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina steeled herself and swallowed the pill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elisa held the box, &#34;You rest, I&#39;ll go dispose of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the bedroom door was suddenly kicked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler stood at the door with two bodyguards, looking coldly at Christina and Elisa. &#34;Mrs. Cavendish, Ms. Windsor, Mr. Nicholas Cavendish requests your presence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s heart sank, sensing trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, the bodyguards dragged Christina over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler handed the outer packaging of the birth control pills, which Elisa hadn&#39;t had time to destroy, to Nicholas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the Cavendish family members were still there, looking at Christina as if she were something filthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially William, whose gaze was as cold as ice, piercing her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina lowered her head, her hands at her sides nervously clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bastard!&#34; Nicholas glanced at the pill box, then picked up an ashtray from the table and threw it at Christina. &#34;What is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ashtray hit Christina&#39;s head, and bright red blood instantly dripped down her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even blink. &#34;Birth control pills!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The undisguised sneers around her made her voice falter. She bit her lip and continued, &#34;I&#39;m an adult, it&#39;s normal to have a relationship!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her lie without batting an eye, Nicholas became even angrier, his cane thumping on the floor. &#34;Open your eyes and look clearly, what is that really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With trembling hands, Christina picked up the box from the floor. Seeing the words on it, her pupils shrank. How could this be...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina looked helplessly at Elisa. The pills were bought by Elisa. Could it be that she hadn&#39;t given up and deliberately bought the wrong pills to force her to marry William by getting pregnant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she looked up, she saw a pair of eyes more terrified than hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t Elisa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s gaze inadvertently met Jennifer&#39;s, who was sitting next to William. The malice hidden behind her tearful eyes made Christina&#39;s heart tremble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Jennifer!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina felt something was wrong and was about to explain when Jennifer suddenly got up and rushed in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Christina. The Cavendish family are good people, I really can&#39;t help you hide this and deceive them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer cried pitifully, looking at Christina with a sorrowful and desolate expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were just taking advantage of the situation to fulfill your youthful dreams. I never thought you were secretly trying to get pregnant to force William to marry you and scheme against William and the Cavendish family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you be so selfish? Have you ever thought about what would happen to me and William if you did this? Even if you don&#39;t think about me, you should think about your mother. Her daughter marrying her husband&#39;s brother, how would she live in the Cavendish family in the future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s accusatory words made the Cavendish family furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen shameless people, but never someone so shameless. She is full of schemes to marry into a wealthy family. If she put her little cleverness to good use, she wouldn&#39;t be so despised by everyone now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vicious, truly vicious! She pretends to clear her name, but in reality, she wants to push Jennifer out to divert attention so she can secretly get pregnant with William&#39;s child. I&#39;ve seen how bad a person&#39;s heart can be today!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such a scourge cannot stay in our Cavendish family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone suggested kicking Christina out of the Cavendish family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was not surprised at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her previous life, wasn&#39;t it the same? As long as Jennifer slightly stirred public opinion, she would become the target of everyone&#39;s anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quietly watched Jennifer&#39;s performance, feeling no waves in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her reaction, Jennifer found it strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did Christina become so calm and composed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, she would have been anxiously defending herself, fearing being misunderstood by the Cavendish family and being kicked out with her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today, she was unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she have some backup plan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina had no idea she had switched the pills. Christina, caught off guard by the Cavendish family&#39;s questioning and her malicious slander, had no reason not to panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, William and Nicholas were so shrewd, how could they believe her just because Christina tried to push the blame on her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not to mention the photos clearly showed Christina. And William, wouldn&#39;t he know who he slept with?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer pursed her lips, ready to deliver a fatal blow to Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to William and cried, &#34;William, I believe Christina didn&#39;t do it on purpose. She must have her own reasons. Please forgive her this time, just pretend it was me that night. I&#39;m willing to bear all the public pressure for the Cavendish family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s voice was gentle and soft, and when she deliberately spoke with a sob, it easily aroused others&#39; pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If one only listened to her voice and words, they would be moved by her deep affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina sighed softly, feeling helpless. &#34;I think what you&#39;re saying makes no sense!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina continued, &#34;I&#39;ve already explained, it wasn&#39;t me that night. Why do you keep insisting it was me? I don&#39;t understand, you&#39;re my uncle&#39;s fiancée, do you really want him to be involved with another woman besides you? You say it was you, and my uncle didn&#39;t refute it, but you&#39;re the one rushing to explain. Why, do you not want to marry my uncle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jennifer&#39;s expression stiffened, and she hurriedly turned to explain, &#34;No, I&#39;m not, I didn&#39;t, don&#39;t talk nonsense!&#34;</p>
