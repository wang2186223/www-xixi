                <p>Christina turned her head away and stopped looking at William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when you hate someone, even their breathing next to you feels suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina impatiently said, &#34;Can you get out of my sight? Now that something has happened to Jennifer, shouldn&#39;t you be with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget, if it weren&#39;t for me, you would now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I should thank you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina interrupted with a cold laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What good is it that William helped her this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would never forget the painful experiences of her past life. No matter what William did, Harper could never come back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harper&#39;s hopes, disappointments, and pain-she would never forget any of it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William squinted his eyes, &#34;Is your hostility towards me that great?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina had changed so much from before, not just towards him, but also towards Jennifer, and even her own mother, including Missy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this weren&#39;t the 21st century, he would really suspect that Christina&#39;s body had been taken over by another soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you can feel it, why do you still interfere with me?&#34; Christina spoke bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no good feelings towards William, only endless hatred. She wouldn&#39;t be grateful and worship William as a god just because of a small favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time William had seen a woman as ungrateful as Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is interfering with whom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s eyes darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In William&#39;s eyes, her first involvement with him was very abrupt. Then there were the things she did, reporting Jennifer, entering the competition herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Including at the school gate, where she accidentally got into his car, and now, he thought she did it on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no intention of interfering with you. If you want to help, that&#39;s your business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although these words were annoying, they also made William unhappy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s face darkened, and he sneered, &#34;So, I&#39;m meddling in other people&#39;s business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But silence meant acquiescence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William called Bob, &#34;Bring that man in and have him recreate the scene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William hung up the phone and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina really didn&#39;t expect William to go this far, recreating the scene-was this a movie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But William was serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The half-dead Harold was thrown in front of Christina. Seeing Christina, Harold begged repeatedly, &#34;Ms. Windsor, I didn&#39;t know your relationship with Mr. Cavendish. Please ask Mr. Cavendish to let me go, I beg you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harold didn&#39;t dare do anything to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina sneered, but before she could say anything, William&#39;s voice came from not far away, &#34;The condition for letting you go is to do it like before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harold was completely stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina wouldn&#39;t give Harold this chance, and she wouldn&#39;t give William the chance to watch the show either. She coldly said, &#34;Only someone like you would have such a perverted hobby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, she stepped forward and grabbed Harold by the collar, &#34;Only scum like you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Christina kicked Harold in the stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harold let out a miserable scream, &#34;I already know I was wrong. Why are you still hitting me? Do you want me to die? Besides, every industry has its rules. If you don&#39;t know this, what are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re saying it&#39;s my fault?&#34; Christina punched him twice more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was using Harold as a punching bag to vent her anger, but she also realized that in this life, she had many things to do and would inevitably face many unknown dangers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to learn some self-defense skills. Otherwise, just like with William, he could easily break her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she knew martial arts, William wouldn&#39;t even be able to get close to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harold cried out in pain, &#34;I didn&#39;t say it was your fault. I&#39;ve already apologized. And I&#39;ve been beaten like this. What more do you want? Do you really want me to die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not asking you to die, but you should suffer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina said as she continued to hit him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was venting her anger and also treating Harold as if he were William.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Christina hitting so happily, William&#39;s face darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had intended to punish Christina for thinking he was meddling, but instead, he had given her a convenient way to vent her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bob, who was behind him, had already realized this. William&#39;s special treatment of Christina was not a good sign!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, he didn&#39;t dare say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina got tired of hitting, and Harold was left barely alive. Christina pointed at his nose, &#34;What you call a common phenomenon doesn&#39;t work with me. From now on, if you see me, go the other way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harold used his last bit of strength to respond to Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harold was dragged away, leaving only Christina and William in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the two didn&#39;t communicate. William&#39;s thin lips were tightly pressed into a straight line, his eyes coldly fixed on Christina, with a hint of sharpness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve finished watching the show. Is there anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina spoke indifferently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, her meaning was clear: if William had nothing else, he could leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s voice came out from his nose, &#34;You want to leave after using me? Who taught you to do things this way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one taught me. I just don&#39;t want to have any contact with you. In case you think I&#39;m seducing you, deliberately approaching you. I have a reputation to maintain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s voice was cold. At this moment, she didn&#39;t want to see William at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hating someone truly comes from the heart, and that sense of repulsion is impossible to suppress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William seemed to hear the biggest joke, &#34;Reputation? Do you still have a reputation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t I have a reputation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already explained what needed to be explained. If people wanted to attack her, that was their business and had nothing to do with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William didn&#39;t respond, but the sarcasm at the corners of his mouth became more apparent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina hated William&#39;s contemptuous and superior attitude. Seeing William unmoved, Christina didn&#39;t want to struggle with him verbally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she was about to bypass William, he grabbed her wrist, &#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle, I asked you to leave, but you didn&#39;t. I know your status is high, and it&#39;s hard to listen to me. If you don&#39;t leave, then I have to go.&#34; Christina coldly mocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William&#39;s expression was extremely unpleasant, and his eyes seemed to reflect endless sharpness, &#34;Christina, are you looking for death?&#34;</p>
