                <p>Aria hugged my neck tightly in fear. I crossed the road and went back to my car.</p>

                <p>Due to the fact that she was unfamiliar with the path, she began searching for her mother. She did not know which way he had come from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw someone who looked like her mother. She tried to stop her, but she was not her mother. Aria started crying because she was lost and had no id</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Adrian came to her, she found hope as if he were someone close to her. She hugged him out of fear that she might become lost once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>END OF THE FLASHBACK</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“If you get lost again, the first thing you should do is ask</p>
                
                
                
                <p>someone for a phone and then give your mom a quick call, okay? “I told Aria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her in tears was something that I did not like to see. She was a little child. How could Natalia be so careless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Uncle, can you give me your phone?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled at her when I realized that she had applied my advice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“For informing your mom?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded her head and wiped away the tears that rolled down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked relaxed, as though she trusted me. I found it surprising how this girl was crying a while ago but is now calming down because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did she trust me? I was a stranger to her, wasn’t I? She should not trust just anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to advise her not to believe in anyone. But looking at her pale face, I could not say it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could put her trust in me. I was not that bad, was I?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You don’t need my phone. I will inform your mom about you. Don’t be concerned.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out my phone and dialed Patric’s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>+16 DO</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you not coming back?” Patric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m with Natalia’s daughter right now.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You what?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t like to repeat my words.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What are you doing with her child? Don’t tell me you are trying to take revenge on Natalia for her family’s words.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned when I heard him. Did he think like that of me? Would I hurt a child to take revenge on their mother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Inform her that Aria is with me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh, okay.” Patric said as he got what the actual matter was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Tell me where you are so that I can inform her to take her daughter from you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something hit my mind as I smirked while looking outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s her duty to find out.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut the call and turned my head towards Aria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Your mom will get to know that you are with me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a smile after hearing me. “She won’t be worried now.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked by her sudden maturity. She was not thinking about herself but about her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told my driver to stop close to an ice cream parlor since Aria wanted to eat ice cream before she got lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to tell my driver to get</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fell on Aria’s upset face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was looking at a little girl who was holding a young man’s hand. It looked like a father brought her child there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you want to go inside?” I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately turned her head away from the window and lowered her head while shaking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt awkward because of her behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Tell your dad to bring you here next time,” I said to her while looking away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not like to talk about Eric, but seeing this child’s upset face, I had to say it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her head and asked,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“My d–dad?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What? Doesn’t your dad take you and your brother out with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I–I don’t have a d–dad.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned at her. Did she not know about her biological father? But I heard that Eric even went to attend the parent’s meeting. “Isn’t Eric your dad?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. “Everyone thinks that he is our dad. In fact, my friend’s parents also think that.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What do you mean? Isn’t he your dad?” I asked with a desperate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment she replied, I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, Eric is our uncle. My mommy said he’s not our dad.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twas at a loss to understand whether or not I should believe this little child’s words. It seemed to me that she was not aware of the truth. On the other h</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After heaving a sigh, I shook my head. “Didn’t Eric go to your parents‘ meeting?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a response, she gave me a slight nod. “But that was because Mommy had an exam that day. Uncle Eric told her not to worry, and he then accompan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She had an exam? She is studying?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mommy has just finished her studies. Don’t you know that?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was not aware of it. Did Natalia continue her studies? She had even completed her graduation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that I recalled how she had given up her schooling in order to marry me. At that time, her adoptive father told me that she had decided not to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was thinking about it, Aria’s mumble reached my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Uncle Eric once told us to call him dad. But Mommy hushed us and told us that we should not refer to another man as our dad. He just loves us a lot, so that’s why he said th</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was stunned by her words. I lowered my head to look at her face and asked,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then who is your dad?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were filled with tears as she gazed at me. “He is not with us. He is no more.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked. “What?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mommy said our dad is no more. She said not to talk about him in our lives. So Noah and I never talk about him.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He is no more?” I muttered while repeating her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened my back and sat up as my thoughts began to mess up. Her words blew my mind. If Eric were really their father, Natalia would not have sa</p>
                
                
                
                <p>impossible for her to destroy an image of their father when he was still in their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere, I felt a heaviness move from my chest. Despite the fact that I was unaware of the reason behind it, the news that their father was not alive left me feeling strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Tell me something more about your dad,” I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. “No. Mommy said not to talk about him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rubbed my forehead as everything was stirring up my senses. Aria looked sad once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got out of the car and went to open the door on her side. I bent down and carried her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let’s go get some ice cream. Don’t be sad.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hugged my neck tightly. She was frightened that she would be lost again. I made her feel secure by holding her tightly in my</p>

                <p>Everyone looked at us as soon as I walked into the ice cream partor</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went straight to the counter, paying no attention to the other people there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Order wherever you want.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chose the vanilla and chocolate flavors and grabbed the ice cream when the staff placed it on the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you want to eat here or inside the car?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a peek around and replied,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s beautiful. I want to eat here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I made my way to the last table, I made her take a seat in one of the chairs, and then I got into the chair that was directly across from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The expression on her face was one of pure joy as she began to consume ice cream. I found her cute. She reminded me of her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was looking at her, I couldn’t help but wonder if her mother had been just as childish when she was younger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It came to my mind that she had to live the life of an orphan. Was she forced to live a life of poverty, or did she have the opportunity to live a life of luxury? As far as I can remember, Gamma Jeremy did not adopt Natalia at this young age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How is mom?” I asked her out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me and replied,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She is the best mom in the world.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wants us to be happy. So Noah and I want her to be happy too.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if someone else were going to pay attention to what she had to say, she leaned a little bit closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I heard my grandma saying to my grandpa that my mommy is alone, so she needs a husband who can protect her.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was caught off guard. I averted my gaze from her and inquired, “What more does your grandma say?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She said my mommy always cried alone. But she never showed her pain to us.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart froze when I heard her. Why did that woman cry? Wasn’t she happy with her boyfriend?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Is your Uncle Eric her boyfriend?”</p>

                <p>I’m asking you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>had lost my mind. What was I even asking a child? Why am I so esperate to know about her mother’s life?</p>

                <p>“Where is my daughter?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalia’s voice reached my ears the sounds of her frantic breathir</p>

                <p>I wondered what Patric had told daughter? Did I have no other wo</p>

                <p>I looked at Aria, who grinned at me. Though I gave her a small smile in return, my voice did not change a little bit when I replied to her mother.</p>

                <p>Mirsan cut the call, which made my blood boil in anger. I</p>

                <p>A few minutes ago, when Beta Patric called me to inform me about Aria, I was feeling relieved that I had finally found her. Until then, I was trying to searc</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when I realized that Aria was with Adrian, another fear evolved within me. I had no idea what I would do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Adrian be so cruel? He kidnapped a little child!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What did he say?” I heard Eric as he put his hand on my</p>

                <p>I turned to him and shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That man said he wanted to know about their father. I think he has learned something for sure.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eric’s brows shot up. “What does he know?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t know, Eric. He said he would send me an address. But he can’t let me take my daughter away until I tell him the truth. How will I?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled my hair in outrage. No matter how much prestige I earned or how many projects I snatched from that man, he knew. my weakness.</p>

                <p>I was in my room right now. Everyone in my family knew about Arla’s disappearance. They were trying their best to find her. So when I got a call from Patric, I told them that one of my friends. found Aria. I did not want them to contact Adrian directly. What if he hurt Aria?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Natalia, what are you doing?” Eric asked, watching me walk to my closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored his question and opened the closet. After unlocking a drawer, I pulled out a gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eric’s eyes widened. “What’s wrong with you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to pull the gun away from me, but I turned away from him to avoid his grab.</p>

                <p>Eric shook his head. “Don’t do anything in anger. Listen to me.” “NO, I CAN’T.” I shouted at him when he grabbed my wrist. Tears rolled down my cheeks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What do you think he will do to my children after learning the truth? He is Adrian Miller. That man will never let me live my life with them peacefully. He w I can’t lose them.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my bottom lip to control my tears and anger at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hooked at the gun and nodded my head. “So It’s the best way to teach him a lesson. I can be a killer, but I can’t stay away from my children.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eric grabbed both of my wrists and pushed to the limit to take the gun away from me just as I was ready to pull the trigger to set it</p>

                <p>I gaped at Eric as I thought about my brother. I could not let Jason get into danger because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then what will I do?” I asked, losing my patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eric put the gun in the closet and closed the door. Jason was the one who gave me that gun. It was because of my safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eric hugged me, and I sobbed. “I am at a loss for what I ought to do at this very moment. Once he is aware of reality, what actions will he take?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eric gently stroked my head in an effort to calm me down. But the words he spoke froze me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He will never get to know the truth. Your children are bound with spells.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly moved my head and raised my head to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“W–What?”</p>

                <p>I felt a little relief from hearing Eric. “What will I say to him “Just lie to him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that time, I got a message from Adrian. He sent me the address of the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the message, I mumbled to myself,</p>

                <p>immediately rushed out of the pack house. While I was leaving, my parents asked me where I was going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tam going to get Aria back,” I replied to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jason was not at home, but I informed him of what I told my parents. I did not want him to remain in distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let’s go,” Eric said, opening his car door for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped in front of his car. I did not want to take him with me. Adrian once doubted my children were Eric’s. I could not do anything to make him mad an</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I want to go alone.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, I can’t let you go alone to that man.” Eric replied, giving me an angry look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I will make an excuse. Don’t worry, Eric.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No. I can’t trust that man. You didn’t tell Jason about it. But if he gets to know about it, he will never forgive me for letting you go to that man.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to request him, but it all went in vain. He was stubborn about going with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt defeated and got in his car. He started to drive, and I lost myself in my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered my other baby. He was feeling guilty that Aria had lost when he was with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I am sorry, Mom.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Noah finally caught up with me, during the time that I wan ot purchasing lee cream for him and Arla, this was the only thing that he continued to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just a child. How could I blame him? It was my fault for not taking care of them properly and giving that ruthless man the chance to blackmail m</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire time we were on our way in silence, I hoped in my head that Aria would be safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear gripped me as I was terrified that Adrian would cause her harm. If that man could try to hurt me, he could do that to my children too. I could not trus</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the car came to a stop in front of the hotel, I was able to recognize the building. It was the best hotel in my pack. My father had a hotel busin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days ago, I sent my men to inspect securities here since most of the visitors came to stay here for their luxurious rooms and environment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting out of the car, Eric came up to me and opened the door for me. He was there to help me, I exited the car and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>checked the message again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Room Number 902.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let’s ask in the reception,” Eric said, entering the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hotel receptionist recognized Eric since he was the beta of this pack. But when her eyes landed on me, she looked amazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I assumed that she saw some news from last night’s party, where my father revealed my identity to everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How may I help you?” she asked us with a polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Room Number 902.” I replied impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sorry?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Where is room number 902?” Eric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave us directions with a confused look. I held Eric’s hand when he was about to go to find the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Can I go alone? You are here, right? If something happens, I will give you a call.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eric was hesitant to agree with my plea. Looking into my hopeful eyes, he gave me a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I am here. Just go and come out with Aria. Don’t talk with that man again. Since you are telling him they are not his own children, you don’t have to give any justifications to him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a little nod and headed to the elevator. I went to the ninth floor and began to look for that room number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I reached the room, my hand was shaken. I lifted my hand and knocked on the door with a trembling heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘I hope you are fine, Aria,‘ I said in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did not take long to open the door. Nevertheless, someone else opened the door. Upon observing his attire, I realized he was there for room service.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door widely for me to enter and said,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please, Madam.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly entered the room as I understood I was in the right room. The door closing behind me gave me = 0:</p>

                <p>My attention was drawn to a young child who was sitting in a chair at the table and eating brownies with a fork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ARIA!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to rush to her but was stopped in the middle by another voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why are we in such a hurry?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I turned my head, I came face–to–face with the man I had always despised in my life. He was seated on a couch at the tim He was surrounded by a few men who were dressed in full blac giving the appearance that they</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I recall well, Jason mentioned last night that he came here wit his Beta and Lynda, didn’t he? So, who exactly were they?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian was smoking as his eyes were digging at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What? You can give jobs to my guards, but I can’t take a few from yours?” he asked, smirking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realized they were my brother’s guards. How did they betray my brother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mommy?”</p>

                <p>“How are you, baby?” I asked and kissed her cheeks, tryi look at her to see if she was fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt relieved that she was totally fine and Adrian did not her</p>

                <p>I frowned at her. “Didn’t I tell you not to eat anything from strangers?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if Adrian mixed something in her food?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard a scoff coming from Adrian’s direction. I stood up a held Aria’s hand to leave the hotel room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was about to get to the door, the guards stopped me fro leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let me go.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian got to his feet and walked toward me and Aria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What an ungrateful woman you are! You lost your child, but when someone helped you get her back, you are leaving withou repaying.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him. “Name a price.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled at me as he threw the cigarette. “Do you think you have anything to repay me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then what do you want me to do? Worship you?” I asked mockingly.</p>

                <p>The guards started to pull Aria away from me. “No, don’t.” I yelled, holding Aria close to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever was going on was perplexing to Aria.</p>

                <p>I was surprised by her words. Did Adrian brainwash my child behind my back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards took her to another room, leaving us alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘So? Let’s start our conversation, Natalia Hansely.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>turned my head toward him. I felt like killing this man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who is your children’s original father?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>looked into his eyes. He was serene as if patiently waiting for y reply.</p>
