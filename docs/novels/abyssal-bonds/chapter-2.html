                <p>The Last Dragon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia trembled as she held the console in the Genesis&#39; management room. After the shimmering circles dissipated, the ocean returned to an eerie silence, but her instincts warned her that the creature was still around. It became ready. watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyone, lower back to your stations,&#34; Sophia ordered, her tone rougher than she intended. The team sprang into action, but their looks revealed their discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve picked up movement once more,&#34; Liam said, pointing to the sonar. &#34;Southwest, a few kilometers from our current location. &#34;It is faint, but it is there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia leaned over the console. The signature was weaker than before, but still identifiable. Her pulse quickened. &#34;Prepare the containment systems.&#34; &#34;I want drones deployed right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you extreme?&#34; Liam requested, his brow wrinkled. &#34;After what just befell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eyed him with a determined expression. &#34;We came here looking for solutions. That piece is the solution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a reluctant nod. Within minutes, the Genesis came alive with activity. The crew worked in deafening stillness, sending out drones equipped with stronger nets and electricity stabilizers. On the main screen, the underwater video confirmed the drones&#39; descent, their brightness piercing through the dark depths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s gaze did not waver. Some of the situations they were dealing with were unusual. It wasn&#39;t just an animal or a few mysterious herbal phenomena. It was something momentous, something that didn&#39;t belong in their world-or even in their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anxiousness in the control room became overwhelming as the drones drew in on the feeble signal. The sonar beeped gradually, with each pulse bringing them closer. The sign disappeared without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell?&#34; Liam mumbled as his arms flew over the controls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s still there,&#34; Sophia said quietly, her instinct telling her something the machines couldn&#39;t. &#34;preserve going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drones moved cautiously. On the screen, the blackness of the ocean appeared to draw in closer, as if the abyss itself were alive. Suddenly, one of the drones came to a halt. The feed fluctuated, and the display was full with static.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drone three just lost power,&#34; a technician announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Switch to Drone 2,&#34; Liam instructed. The second feed went live, showing the primary drone hanging in the water, its lighting fixtures dull. Something moved in the background-a flash of blue scales that was almost too quick to record.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There it is,&#34; Sophia said softly, her pulse thumping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beast appeared before everyone had time to react. Its huge body coiled around the drone, its dazzling scales vibrating with energy. It became both beautiful and scary, a mythical creature brought to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;deploy the containment net!&#34; Sophia shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last drones went into action, freeing the internet. It rose through the water, its strengthened threads shimmering slightly as it closed around the creature. For a brief while, it thrashed, its motions so fierce that the Genesis groaned under the force of the currents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;hold it regular!&#34; Liam yelled, his voice barely audible above the alarms. The strength stabilizers engaged, sending a pulse across the net. The creature froze, its glow dimming as the confinement system took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it... working?&#34; someone inquired nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia grasped the console&#39;s edge as she watched the display screen. The thing remained, its huge form floating in the internet like a caught god. She sighed, her breathing unsteady. &#34;bring it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Genesis&#39;s protective facility has become a marvel of engineering, intended to keep and examine huge marine specimens. However, nothing they had planned for came close to this. As the creature was reduced to the containment chamber, the room filled with a soft, ethereal light emanating from its scales.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stood at the statement window, unable to take her gaze away. It appeared smaller, curled up in the big tank, but no less menacing. Its frame shimmered softly, the light pulsing together with its breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam approached, his face a mix of astonishment and unease. &#34;What can we even call it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia didn&#39;t respond. Her focus was entirely on the thing. Something about it called to her, eliciting emotions she couldn&#39;t identify. It wasn&#39;t just an animal. It became additional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if in reaction to her thoughts, the thing changed. Its golden eyes opened and locked onto hers through the glass. She froze over. The relationship became instantaneous and electrifying, as if there was no distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia?&#34; Liam&#39;s voice ended the curse. She blinked, her heart pumping, and turned toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had been... staring,&#34; he explained, frowning. &#34;like you have been in a trance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m exceptional,&#34; she exclaimed quickly, despite her shivering arms. &#34;Let&#39;s run a complete analysis. I wish to understand everything about this feature, including its biology and strength output.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam nodded, but the challenge stayed. &#34;Be cautious,&#34; he said gently before going away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia returned to the tank. The thing had not moved, but its eyes remained fixed on her. She put her hand against the glass, and for a split second, the light from its scales flared brighter. She drew her hand lower back, her pulse racing. What was it attempting to tell her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours passed as the crew worked feverishly to research the creature. Its electricity production skyrocketed, causing interference with their devices. Nobody may desire to explain the bioluminescence or the normal electromagnetic field it emitted. Then there was its size-significantly greater than any known marine species, with a skeleton form that defied sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But none of this defined what happened next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia was studying data inside the lab as the alarms went off again. She dashed to the preserving facility, her heart in her throat. When she arrived, the throng had already gathered, staring in stunned stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The beast began converting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Its body shone brighter, its scales moving and retracting. As they watched, it began to cut back, its enormous shape folding in on itself. Limbs appeared where none previously existed, with the tail shrinking and the top redesigning. Within minutes, the dragon was long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In its vicinity stood a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room grew silent, the only sound being the low hum of the confinement subject. The individual looked up, his golden eyes penetrating and familiar. His dark hair clung to his face, and his bare chest rose and fell with each breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia was unable to circulate. The closeness she felt earlier was deeper, more powerful now, as if an invisible thread connected them. The man&#39;s gaze latched on hers, and he leapt forward, his actions elegant despite the restrictions of the tank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What... is this?&#34; Liam regained control, his voice shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before each person could respond, the man raised his hand. The containment subject sparked, and the lights flickered. A deep growl echoed across the chamber, and the tank&#39;s glass fractured, forming a slender fissure that snaked over the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;close it down!&#34; Sophia shouted, but it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glass cracked, and the man went outside, water falling around him. The crew stepped away, worried expressions on their faces. Sophia stood on the floor, her coronary heart pounding in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; she inquired, her voice firm despite the commotion around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person cocked his head to analyze her. While speaking, his voice became deeper and more resonant. &#34;You don&#39;t realize?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia frowned, her bewilderment clashing with the incredible sense of recognition she felt. &#34;recognize what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved closer, his golden eyes glowing with depth. &#34;Have you already forgotten? &#34;What you are...what I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking approximately?&#34; She demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The alarms rang again just as he should have solved the problem. This time, it wasn&#39;t from the beast or the man. Something else occurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve got incoming!&#34; exclaimed a technician from the control room. &#34;multiple signatures, heading straight for us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia matured into the display. The sonar revealed six large things moving quickly towards the Genesis. Her stomach sank. Whatever was available, it was not nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person-if he had become human-stepped in the direction of Sophia, his look serious. &#34;You delivered them here. Now you must face the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was filled with a faint, resonating hum. Sophia developed to become the man, fear and resolve battling within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are they?&#34; She requested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His golden eyes narrowed. &#34;Hunters.&#34;</p>
