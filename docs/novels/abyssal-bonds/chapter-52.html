                <p>As they went deeper, strange images flickered at the edge of Sophia&#39;s awareness-glimpses of other worlds, other realities brushing against their own. The boundary between dimensions grew thinner the further they fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can sense the Heart,&#34; Tharros said, his voice strained from maintaining the staircase. &#34;It&#39;s calling to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear it too,&#34; Sophia responded. Though there was no real sound, she could feel a pull, a rhythmic pulse calling her downward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stairs finally gave out fully, leaving them hovering in darkness so complete it seemed solid. Only their barrier supplied light, a small bubble of reality in an ocean of nothingness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now what?&#34; Kael asked, looking down at the endless drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia closed her eyes, focusing on the strange new senses that had woken within her since coming to Aquaria. The water that had risen to join their magical barrier reacted to her will, expanding outward, feeling for currents in the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There,&#34; she said, pointing to what looked to be empty space. &#34;I can feel a passage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see nothing,&#34; Kael revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust her,&#34; Tharros encouraged. &#34;The Light Bearer&#39;s senses are attuned to spaces between worlds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Sophia leading them, they moved through the darkness, their barrier the only light in an endless void. Minutes stretched into what felt like hours as they managed invisible currents, moving ever deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then suddenly, far below, a speck of light appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Heart,&#34; Arin whispered. &#34;We&#39;re almost there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they drew closer, the pinpoint expanded, showing a chamber that glowed with pulsing energy. Within it stood a crystalline structure that resembled a throne, surrounded by swirling patterns of light that formed and remade in endless complexity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The center of all barriers,&#34; Tharros stated. &#34;Where the worlds were first divided.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were only moments away from reaching it when Sophia felt something brush against their barrier-something cold and ancient and hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not alone,&#34; she warned, her heart racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadow that had followed them through Luminoth now showed itself, spreading across their magical shield like ink in water. Where it touched, their barrier began to crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The corruption!&#34; Kael yelled, drawing his weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Arin countered, her face pale with recognition. &#34;Something worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadow coalesced into a roughly humanoid shape, its features shifting and changing like smoke. But its eyes remained constant-endless pits of darkness that seemed to eat light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Void Walker,&#34; Tharros growled. &#34;Guardian of the spaces between.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unwelcome visitors,&#34; the entity whispered, its voice like ice cracking. &#34;Or perhaps... sacrifices?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their barrier continued to weaken under its touch, darkness seeping in. They were caught between the Void Walker and the Heart, with nowhere to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do?&#34; Sophia asked, struggling to keep her part of the failing shield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros met her stare, his expression grim but determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We walk into the Heart,&#34; he said simply. &#34;Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for agreement, he pulled Sophia forward, trusting Kael and Arin to follow. The Void Walker reached for them with shadowy tendrils, but they were already falling, plunging toward the glowing room below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they fell, their barrier collapsed fully, leaving them exposed to whatever awaited them in the Heart of Luminoth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Secrets in the Black</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They fell through darkness, spinning without direction or control. Sophia reached for Tharros, their fingers barely touching before being torn apart by unknown currents. The last remains of their protective shield scattered like stardust around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on to something!&#34; Kael yelled, his voice strangely muffled in the thick darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing to hold!&#34; Arin called back, her form now just a dim shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia tumbled through the void, fear rising in her chest. Then something strange happened-the darkness began to feel... different. Not empty, but full. Not cold, but alive with action. It pressed against her skin like water, but thicker, more solid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On reflex, she spread her arms and legs, as if swimming. The darkness responded, her fall slowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s like liquid!&#34; she called to the others. &#34;Swim!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw Tharros&#39;s golden eyes flash as he followed her lead, his strong strokes bringing him closer. Kael and Arin adjusted their moves too, fighting against the strange resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they regained control, Sophia noticed something even stranger-patterns in the darkness. Not visible patterns, but flows and currents she could somehow feel. Like reading braille with her full body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can feel... information,&#34; she said, her voice hushed with wonder. &#34;The darkness is talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Tharros asked, now beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia focused on the sensations flowing over her skin. &#34;It&#39;s like... history. Memories stored in the currents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin swam closer, her face intense. &#34;The Void holds the memories of all worlds. Few can read them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you see?&#34; Kael asked, keeping watch for the Void Walker that had attacked them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia closed her eyes, letting the designs wash through her. Images bloomed in her mind-ancient scenes from the dawn of seas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see... the first dragons,&#34; she whispered. &#34;Swimming in seas that hadn&#39;t yet split from land. The world was whole then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The darkness increased around them, almost like fog. Shapes began to form-not solid, but defined enough to make out. The darkness itself was creating images, reacting to Sophia&#39;s ability to read it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; Tharros breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, the past of the oceans played out in shifting shadows. First dragons, their scales sparkling even in these phantom shapes. Ancient mer-people making coral cities. Sea witches channeling power through crystal staves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The original harmony,&#34; Arin recognized. &#34;Before the barriers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scenes changed, showing conflict-warfare between sea and land, magical explosions that tore reality itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The First Sundering,&#34; Tharros named it. &#34;When my ancestors helped create the barriers to separate the worlds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>New shapes formed in the living darkness-four figures channeling power into a center point. A fifth figure emerged from that power, huge and serpentine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The first Leviathan,&#34; Sophia realized. &#34;It wasn&#39;t a monster. It was made as a guardian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A willing vessel,&#34; Kael added, remembering Veritax&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they watched, the shadow Leviathan changed, evil creeping through its form like veins of corruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something went wrong,&#34; Tharros said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pictures faded, leaving them floating in darkness once more. But Sophia could still feel the currents of information moving around her, guiding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This way,&#34; she said with certainty, pointing lower and to the left. &#34;I can feel the path.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They swam through the thick darkness, following Sophia&#39;s direction. The pressure rose the deeper they went, squeezing against them like a giant fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need protection,&#34; Arin warned. &#34;This depth will crush even us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded. &#34;Let&#39;s try the barrier again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached for each other, making a circle as they continued to swim. This time, when they focused their combined power, something different happened. The darkness itself reacted, weaving into their magic like a willing partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new shield formed around them-not pushing the darkness away, but working with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s helping us,&#34; Sophia mused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or using us,&#34; Arin replied, her expression wary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they fell further, strange creatures began to appear in the gloom. Unlike the shadow images they&#39;d seen before, these were real-living beings that had adapted to the crushing darkness of the ditch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fish with transparent bodies and huge eyes that gave off their own faint light. Jellied creatures that pulsed with slow, deliberate moves. And stranger beings that baffled description-part plant, part animal, part living shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Life finds a way,&#34; Sophia whispered, her scientist&#39;s heart filled with wonder. &#34;Even here, between worlds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One creature in particular caught her attention-a swirling mass of darkness with dozens of tentacles that reached out as they passed. Unlike the others, it seemed aware of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t touch it,&#34; Kael warned, drawing his weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sophia felt no threat from the thing. &#34;Wait,&#34; she said, putting out her hand toward one questing tendril.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia, no!&#34; Tharros lunged to stop her, but too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tendril brushed against her fingers. Instead of danger, Sophia felt a rush of information-not words, but ideas, flooding into her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s communicating,&#34; she gasped. &#34;It&#39;s... curious about us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More tendrils reached toward them, not fiercely but with an alien sort of interest. Where they touched their barrier, they left whirling patterns like writing in an unknown language.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are they?&#34; Kael asked, dropping his weapon slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Void Dancers,&#34; Arin answered, recognition coming on her face. &#34;Guardians of the deep places. I thought they were lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The creature-the Void Dancer-continued its strange contact with Sophia. In her mind, she saw flashes of the Heart they sought, and something else-something huge stirring far below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s warning us,&#34; she explained. &#34;The Leviathan is waking. It senses our approach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Void Dancer suddenly withdrew its tentacles, spinning faster before shooting away into the darkness. Other creatures followed, running in all directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That can&#39;t be good,&#34; Kael mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep vibration shook the water around them, so strong they could feel it in their bones. Their barrier flickered under the attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to move faster,&#34; Tharros urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This way,&#34; Sophia said, pointing toward the source of the sound. &#34;The Heart is there-I can feel it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They swam harder, fighting against currents that suddenly seemed determined to push them back. The darkness grew even thicker, if that was possible, pressing against their barrier like a live thing trying to get in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t want us to reach the Heart,&#34; Arin realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or something doesn&#39;t,&#34; Kael amended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another jolt, stronger than the first, rippled through the deep. This time, they could hear something within it-a sound so low it was more felt than heard. A voice, ancient and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHO DARES?&#34; it rumbled through the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;The Leviathan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vibrations increased, focusing on their small group. Their barrier started to crack under the pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t hold it!&#34; Arin cried, strain obvious on her face as she poured more power into their protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither can I,&#34; Kael admitted, his silver power flickering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt their shield fading, darkness seeping through the cracks. But within that darkness, she could still read patterns-and now she understood what they meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s afraid,&#34; she realized. &#34;The Leviathan is afraid of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would it fear us?&#34; Tharros asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because we can free it,&#34; Sophia answered, realization dawning. &#34;It was corrupted, yes-but it&#39;s also stuck. Bound to a job it never chose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pressure against their barrier suddenly eased, as if the darkness was considering her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that true?&#34; Tharros asked Arin. &#34;Could the renewal ceremony free the current Leviathan rather than creating a new one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin paused. &#34;Possibly. The texts never stated. They only said a willing vessel was needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The darkness parted before them, showing a pulsing light below-not bright, but distinct against the absolute black. The Heart of Luminoth, the center of barrier magic, the source of the Leviathan&#39;s power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here,&#34; Sophia whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they approached, the pulsing light showed a massive chamber. Crystalline structures rose from the floor and hung from the roof like giant teeth. In the middle floated a swirling vortex of energy-blues, purples, and blacks mixing together in hypnotic patterns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what made them gasp wasn&#39;t the Heart itself, but what surrounded it. A massive serpentine form encircled the room, its scaled body so vast they could only see parts of it at once. Where scales had once shimmered with protective magic, now evil flowed like oil, corrupting what had once been pure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan&#39;s enormous head turned toward them, eyes like twin abysses focused on their small group. Its mouth opened, showing endless rows of teeth that glowed with the same energy as the Heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHY HAVE YOU COME?&#34; its voice shook the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could answer, a familiar shadow materialized beside the Leviathan-the Void Walker, its formless body now taking on a more solid look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They come to replace you, Great One,&#34; the Void Walker said, its voice like ice cracking. &#34;To bind another to eternal servitude while you are destroyed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan&#39;s huge body tensed, darkness flowing faster through its corrupted scales.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Sophia shouted. &#34;That&#39;s not why we&#39;re here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the Leviathan was already moving, its huge tail sweeping toward them with the force of an underwater avalanche.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their barrier broke totally as darkness and light collided, and the four companions were thrown in different directions, separated in the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing Sophia saw before awareness faded was Tharros reaching desperately for her, his golden eyes wide with fear as darkness swallowed them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers in the Dark</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia woke to complete darkness. Her head throbbed as she tried to remember what had happened. The Leviathan&#39;s tail had hit their protection barrier, and then... nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tharros?&#34; she called out, her voice small in the great emptiness. &#34;Kael? Arin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No answer came back. She was alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic bubbled up in her chest, but she pushed it down. Panicking wouldn&#39;t help. She closed her eyes-not that it made any difference in this darkness-and focused on the currents around her. The strange liquid darkness still flowed with information, with memories and words of the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could use this. She could find the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia spread her arms and began to swim, letting her newfound senses guide her. The darkness seemed less threatening now that she understood it was alive with knowledge. It wasn&#39;t trying to harm her-it was trying to connect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Show me my friends,&#34; she whispered to the void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The currents changed around her, and she felt a gentle pull to her right. She followed it, swimming steadily through the thick darkness. As she moved, she became aware of a faint glow in the distance. Not the pulsing energy of the Heart, but something smaller, more recognizable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tharros!&#34; she cried, swimming faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dragon king turned at the sound of her voice, relief washing over his face as she came into view. &#34;Sophia! Are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head as she reached him, throwing her arms around his neck. &#34;I&#39;m okay. Just lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arms closed around her, and she felt his heartbeat-strong and steady against her chest. &#34;I thought I&#39;d lost you,&#34; he whispered into her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shimmering light emerged nearby, and they turned to see Kael swimming toward them, his silver magic lighting the darkness around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank the depths,&#34; he said, his normally stoic face breaking into a rare smile. &#34;I&#39;ve been searching everywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you found Arin?&#34; Sophia asked, looking past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s smile faded. &#34;No. I thought she might be with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill that had nothing to do with the cold darkness ran down Sophia&#39;s spine. &#34;We need to find her. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They joined hands, and Sophia closed her eyes again, reaching out to the currents around them. &#34;Show us Arin,&#34; she ordered the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the pull was stronger, more intense. They swam together, following Sophia&#39;s direction through the endless black. As they moved deeper, Sophia noticed something strange-whispers that weren&#39;t part of the information flow. Actual voices, saying words she couldn&#39;t quite catch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you hear that?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros frowned. &#34;Hear what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Voices. Whispering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s grip on her hand tightened. &#34;I don&#39;t hear anything, Sophia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That worried her more than if they had heard it too. If only she could hear the words, what did that mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glow of the Heart appeared again in the distance, pulsing with its fascinating blue-purple-black energy. But it wasn&#39;t just the Heart she saw. A small figure floated before it, arms spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin!&#34; Sophia called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sea witch didn&#39;t turn. She seemed frozen in place, looking at something they couldn&#39;t see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They swam faster, but as they got closer, Sophia felt resistance pushing against them-like swimming against a strong current. The Leviathan was nowhere to be seen, but its presence lingered in the chamber, a crushing weight of ancient strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something&#39;s wrong,&#34; Tharros growled, his eyes fixed on Arin&#39;s lifeless form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they drew nearer, Sophia saw what had caught Arin&#39;s attention. Floating before her was a shard of crystal, black as the void around them but somehow darker still, as if it swallowed the little light that reached it. It pulsed with the same beat as the Heart, but its energy felt wrong-corrupted and twisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin, get away from that!&#34; Kael shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin finally turned, and Sophia gasped. Her eyes were faraway, unfocused, as if she was listening to something only she could hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you hear it?&#34; Arin whispered, her voice dreamy and far away. &#34;It&#39;s calling to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s calling to you?&#34; Sophia asked, trying to push closer despite the invisible force keeping them back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The power,&#34; Arin said, turning back to the crystal shard. &#34;Ancient magic. Magic from before the walls. Magic strong enough to save us all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whispers Sophia had heard grew louder, and now she could make out words: Power. Freedom. Control. Take it. It&#39;s yours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t listen to it, Arin!&#34; Sophia cried. &#34;It&#39;s the Leviathan trying to trick you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Arin wasn&#39;t listening. Her hand reached out toward the shard, fingers just inches away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin, stop!&#34; Tharros ordered, his voice carrying the full weight of his authority as king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Arin paused. Her hand trembled in midair as she fought against the pull of the shard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; Sophia begged. &#34;Whatever it&#39;s promising you, it&#39;s not worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s eyes cleared slightly. &#34;You don&#39;t understand,&#34; she said, her voice shaking. &#34;This power could change everything. We wouldn&#39;t need the repeat ceremony. We wouldn&#39;t need to bind another being to endless servitude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s another way,&#34; Sophia urged. &#34;The Leviathan can be freed, not replaced. We can break the cycle, Arin!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubt flashed across Arin&#39;s face. &#34;Can we really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Sophia said with all the conviction she could manage. &#34;Together. All four of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s hand dropped slightly. The whispers grew more wild, more desperate. They&#39;ll betray you. They always do. Take the power for yourself. Save yourself. &#34;I&#39;ve been alone for so long,&#34; Arin whispered, so quietly Sophia almost didn&#39;t hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not alone anymore,&#34; Kael said strongly. &#34;You have us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tear slipped down Arin&#39;s face, glowing faintly in the darkness. &#34;I want to believe that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then believe it,&#34; Tharros said, his voice softer than Sophia had ever heard it. &#34;Come back to us, Arin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For one long moment, Sophia thought they&#39;d gotten through to her. Arin&#39;s hand began to withdraw, her body turning toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the water around them shook violently. The Leviathan&#39;s roar echoed through the chamber, though the beast itself stayed hidden. The unseen force holding them back suddenly increased tenfold, pushing them away from Arin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Sophia screamed, reaching out frantically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was too late. Arin&#39;s body jerked backward, as if pulled by invisible ropes. Her back arched, her face twisted in pain-or was it pleasure? Her hand closed around the crystal shard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light burst from the point of contact, not the warm light of Arin&#39;s magic but something cold and alien. It crawled up her arm like lines of black fire, spreading across her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ARIN!&#34; they screamed in unison, fighting against the force pushing them away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the light faded, Arin floated motionless before them. Slowly, she turned, and Sophia felt her blood freeze in her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s eyes had changed. The warm amber was gone, replaced by whirling abysses of black and purple-the same eyes as the Leviathan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile spread across her face, terrible and beautiful. &#34;I understand now,&#34; she said, her voice layered with something old and other. &#34;I see everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her hand, and the darkness around them reacted, swirling and thickening into a wall that pushed them further away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin, fight it!&#34; Sophia begged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Arin only smiled wider. &#34;Why would I fight what I&#39;ve always been?&#34; she asked. &#34;The evil has always been inside me. Now I&#39;ve simply accepted it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of her hand, the currents around them turned violent, spinning them away from her and the Heart. The last thing Sophia saw before darkness claimed her again was Arin turning back to the pulsing Heart, her hand-now glowing with evil power-reaching out to claim it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadows Within</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The swirling currents finally freed Sophia, Tharros, and Kael, sending them tumbling through the darkness. Sophia&#39;s back hit something solid-a wall of crystal that glowed softly with blue light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everyone okay?&#34; she asked, pushing herself upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Barely,&#34; Kael groaned, his silver power flickering weakly around him. &#34;That was no ordinary current.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros moved to Sophia&#39;s side, his golden eyes scanning the surroundings. &#34;We&#39;re in some kind of tube. The Heart chamber must be connected to a network of passageways.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia pressed her hand against the crystal wall. It hummed beneath her touch, almost like it was living. &#34;We have to go back for Arin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; Kael asked. &#34;You saw what happened. Whatever that crystal shard was, it&#39;s changed her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care,&#34; Sophia said strongly. &#34;We&#39;re not leaving her behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded. &#34;Agreed. But we need a plan. Rushing back in blindly won&#39;t help anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faraway sound echoed through the tunnel-part scream, part roar. It made Sophia&#39;s skin prickle with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, they began swimming back toward the Heart chamber, led by the pulsing energy they could still feel even from a distance. The crystal walls around them grew darker as they approached, black lines spreading across the once-pristine blue surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at the walls,&#34; Kael said quietly. &#34;It&#39;s like they&#39;re getting sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia realized he was right. The darkness spreading through the crystals looked exactly like an infection-or rot. Just like what had happened to Arin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally reached the entrance to the Heart chamber, they stopped, hidden behind a large crystal formation. The scene before them made Sophia&#39;s breath catch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin floated in the middle of the chamber, surrounded by a sphere of pulsing dark energy. Her body had changed. Black lines ran beneath her skin, glowing with purple light. Her hair floated around her head like limbs, moving with a life of its own. The crystal shard was now buried in her chest, right over her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan circled her, its huge body coiled in a protective spiral. Its eyes-the same swirling darkness that now filled Arin&#39;s-watched her with something like pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do?&#34; Sophia whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39;s face was grim. &#34;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never seen evil like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; Kael pointed to the Heart. &#34;It&#39;s changing too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whirling vortex of energy that made up the Heart of Luminoth was different. Threads of pure darkness had started to weave through the blue and purple, like ink dropped in water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If the Heart becomes fully corrupted...&#34; Tharros didn&#39;t finish the sentence. He didn&#39;t have to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to get to Arin,&#34; Sophia said. &#34;If we can remove that shard, maybe we can save her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how do you suggest we get past the Leviathan?&#34; Kael asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could answer, Arin&#39;s head suddenly snapped in their direction. A smile spread across her face-the same terrible, beautiful smile from before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re there,&#34; she called, her voice echoing oddly. &#34;Come out. Let me show you what I&#39;ve found.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They traded wary glances, then slowly emerged from their hiding place. The Leviathan growled, a sound that vibrated the water around them, but Arin raised a hand and it fell quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin,&#34; Sophia said slowly, &#34;what&#39;s happening to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin looked down at her hands, studying the black veins with interest. &#34;Evolution, Sophia. I&#39;m becoming more than I was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That thing is corrupting you,&#34; Tharros said, his voice hard with worry. &#34;Let us help you remove it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin laughed, the sound musical yet wrong. &#34;Remove it? Why would I want that? Do you have any idea what I can see now? What I can feel?&#34; She spun in a circle, trails of dark energy following her moves. &#34;The knowledge, the power...&#34;</p>
