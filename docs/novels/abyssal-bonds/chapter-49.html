                <p>Kael stared at the narrow opening, his warrior pride battling with frustration. All his life, he&#39;d relied on strength to overcome obstacles. Now, that same strength was failing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me try again,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait.&#34; Tharros put a hand on his shoulder. &#34;What if force is the wrong approach? The carvings show healing, not fighting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s eyes widened as understanding dawned. &#34;Not strength alone, but strength with restraint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He approached the tunnel again, but this time with a different mindset. Instead of charging in, he moved slowly, feeling the energy of the passage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s like swimming through a coral reef,&#34; he said. &#34;You have to move with it, not against it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inch by inch, he made his way into the tunnel. When he reached the narrow point that had trapped him before, he didn&#39;t push harder. Instead, he relaxed, making himself smaller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To everyone&#39;s amazement, the passage widened slightly, allowing him through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s working!&#34; his voice echoed back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia watched through her soundsight as Kael navigated the twisting path. The tunnel wasn&#39;t just a physical challenge-it responded to his intentions, his emotions. When he grew frustrated, it tightened. When he stayed calm, it opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s through!&#34; Arin announced as Kael&#39;s green bracelet disappeared around a bend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go next,&#34; Sophia volunteered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, they followed Kael&#39;s example, moving with gentle purpose rather than force. Sophia found the tunnel surprisingly easy to navigate once she understood its nature. It wasn&#39;t meant to stop them-it was testing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The passage twisted downward, growing darker and colder. After what felt like hours of crawling, Sophia emerged into another cave where Kael waited. Arin followed shortly after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They waited for Tharros, but minutes passed with no sign of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s too big,&#34; Kael worried. &#34;His dragon form is massive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not in dragon form,&#34; Arin countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they were about to go back for him, they heard a scraping sound. Tharros emerged from the tunnel, breathing hard, his large frame barely fitting through the opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That,&#34; he panted, &#34;was not designed for someone my size.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They helped him to his feet and turned to see what lay ahead. This new cave was larger than the first, with a high ceiling that disappeared into darkness. Their bracelets illuminated a platform surrounded by deep water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the center of the platform stood a stone pedestal carved with ancient symbols. Atop it rested a single object-a ceremonial dagger with a blade that glowed with the same light as their bracelets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this place?&#34; Arin wondered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael approached the pedestal cautiously. &#34;Some kind of shrine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia followed, drawn by the strange pull that had guided them all this way. As she neared the dagger, the feeling in her chest intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we&#39;re supposed to take it,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael reached for the weapon, but his hand froze inches away. &#34;I can&#39;t. There&#39;s some kind of barrier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros and Arin tried as well, but none could touch the dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me try,&#34; Sophia said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her fingers approached the hilt, the barrier parted like water. She lifted the dagger, surprised by its lightness. The moment she held it, the blade&#39;s glow brightened, casting sharp shadows across the cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why you?&#34; Kael asked, not jealously but with genuine curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sophia could answer, the water around the platform began to churn. Something was rising from the depths-something large.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get behind me,&#34; Kael ordered, positioning himself protectively in front of the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A massive tentacle broke the surface, then another. Inky black with pulsing purple veins, they reached toward the platform with frightening purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Leviathan,&#34; Tharros whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More tentacles appeared, surrounding them on all sides. There was nowhere to run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do?&#34; Arin&#39;s dark energy swirled around her hands, ready to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stared at the dagger in her hand, then at the approaching tentacles. The pull in her chest wasn&#39;t fear anymore-it was recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; she said. &#34;Don&#39;t attack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if responding to her voice, the tentacles paused their advance. One moved closer, hovering before her face. Up close, Sophia could see that the corruption wasn&#39;t complete-flecks of blue still glimmered within the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s in pain,&#34; she realized. &#34;It&#39;s been in pain for thousands of years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dagger in her hand pulsed with light, matching the rhythm of her heartbeat. Somehow, she understood what needed to be done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I know why I&#39;m the light bearer,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a step toward the waiting tentacle, the dagger held not as a weapon, but as an offering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia, no!&#34; Kael moved to stop her, but Tharros held him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is her task,&#34; the dragon king said. &#34;Trust her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Sophia reached toward the corrupted limb, the largest tentacle yet rose from the water directly in front of her. At its tip, a single eye opened-ancient and filled with darkness, yet with a tiny spark of light still fighting to survive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dagger glowed brighter as Sophia raised it. The eye watched her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not here to hurt you,&#34; she whispered. &#34;I&#39;m here to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eye blinked once, and in that moment, Sophia felt a connection form-a bridge between her mind and the ancient creature&#39;s. Images flashed through her thoughts: the Leviathan in its original glory, a terrible betrayal, an endless age of darkness and rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But most clearly, she saw what needed to be done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to her friends, her face set with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to go deeper,&#34; she said. &#34;To the heart of the abyss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tentacles withdrew, opening a path in the churning water-not away from the Leviathan, but toward it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toward the darkest depths of all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where Light Fears to Tread</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tentacles parted like a curtain, revealing a path that plunged straight down into darkness. Sophia clutched the glowing dagger tightly as she peered over the edge. The pull in her chest had grown stronger, urging her toward the unknown depths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we really following the monster that&#39;s been terrorizing Aquaria for centuries?&#34; Kael asked, his voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded. &#34;It&#39;s not what we thought. Someone hurt it, stole its light. We need to fix what was broken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros moved beside her, his golden eyes reflecting the dagger&#39;s glow. &#34;The abyss is no place for the unprepared. Even in my dragon form, I&#39;ve never ventured this deep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have no choice,&#34; Arin said, her dark robes swirling around her ankles. &#34;The corruption is spreading faster now. If we turn back, there won&#39;t be an Aquaria to save.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without further debate, they dove into the opening. The water grew colder as they descended, pressing against their bodies with increasing force. Their bracelets&#39; light seemed to shrink, as if the darkness was eating it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like hours of swimming downward, the narrow tunnel opened up. Sophia gasped as they emerged onto the edge of a vast, flat plain stretching as far as their limited vision allowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Abyssal Plain,&#34; Tharros whispered, his voice tight with effort. &#34;Few have seen it and returned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here, the pressure was almost unbearable. Sophia felt like giant hands were squeezing her chest. Even breathing took concentration. She noticed Tharros&#39;s form shimmering, his usually solid appearance becoming transparent at the edges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; she asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grimaced. &#34;The dragon in me struggles here. Too much pressure, too little light.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael reached out to steady him. &#34;We need to move quickly then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They pushed forward across the plain, their movements sluggish in the crushing depths. Strange creatures darted just outside their circle of light-some appeared ancient, with primitive features that belonged to a time long past, while others seemed almost mechanical, with glowing parts that pulsed with eerie rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These beings,&#34; Arin said, studying a jellyfishlike creature with clockwork tentacles. &#34;They don&#39;t make sense. Some look like they&#39;re from the past, others from... somewhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time works differently in the abyss,&#34; Tharros managed between labored breaths. &#34;The deepest places touch the oldest magic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dagger in Sophia&#39;s hand suddenly flared bright, then dimmed. The strange device began to vibrate, its metal growing warm against her palm. Tiny cracks appeared along the blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s breaking!&#34; she cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of shattering, the dagger&#39;s form shifted. The metal seemed to melt and reform, the hilt curving to fit her hand perfectly. Symbols etched themselves along the blade, matching the markings on her skin. When the transformation finished, the weapon glowed brighter than before, pushing back the crushing darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not breaking,&#34; Arin observed. &#34;Changing. Like you did when you first came to Aquaria.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The newly transformed dagger sent out a pulse of light that spread across the plain. In its wake, Sophia&#39;s soundsight revealed more of their surroundings. The abyssal floor wasn&#39;t just empty space-it was covered with patterns, massive symbols etched into the seabed itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; she pointed. &#34;These markings are like the ones in the cave, but bigger. Much bigger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael swam lower, tracing a curve that stretched for hundreds of feet. &#34;They&#39;re everywhere. The whole plain is covered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a map,&#34; Tharros realized, his voice stronger as the dagger&#39;s light seemed to stabilize his form. &#34;No, more than that. It&#39;s a record.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they followed the patterns, the pull in Sophia&#39;s chest grew stronger. The dagger tugged her forward, leading them across the vast plain toward something in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There,&#34; Arin pointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from the abyssal floor were enormous structures that couldn&#39;t possibly be natural. Towering pillars and arches formed a city unlike anything they&#39;d seen in Aquaria. The buildings appeared both ancient and impossibly advanced, with surfaces that rippled like living tissue yet held the precision of master craftsmanship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this place?&#34; Kael breathed, his warrior&#39;s confidence momentarily shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s dagger pulsed in time with her heartbeat as they approached the strange city. &#34;I think... I think this is where it all began.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They swam toward the massive archway that marked the entrance. Strange symbols glowed as they approached, responding to their presence-or perhaps to the dagger in Sophia&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; Tharros cautioned, grabbing her arm. &#34;Something&#39;s wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sophia could respond, the water around them began to vibrate. The sensation started as a gentle humming but quickly intensified until their teeth chattered and their vision blurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; Kael shouted, drawing closer to protect Sophia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vibrations peaked, then suddenly stopped. In the eerie silence that followed, they noticed the water had grown unnaturally still, as if time itself had paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A figure appeared in the archway-humanoid but clearly not human. Its skin shimmered with the same bioluminescence as the Leviathan&#39;s corrupted form, but this being&#39;s light was pure, untainted by darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The light returns,&#34; it said, its voice somehow clear despite the crushing depth. &#34;But you are not what we expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure&#39;s gaze fixed on Sophia, then on the dagger she held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You carry our key, yet you are not of our blood,&#34; it continued. &#34;How is this possible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sophia could answer, more figures emerged from the city, surrounding them in a circle of light. Each one studied them with ancient eyes that seemed to pierce through flesh and bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They have followed the Wounded One,&#34; another voice said. &#34;They seek to heal what was broken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impossible,&#34; a third replied. &#34;The light was taken by the surface dwellers. They cannot undo their ancestors&#39; crime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt the others tense beside her. Kael&#39;s hand moved to a weapon at his belt, while Arin&#39;s fingers curled, dark energy gathering between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop,&#34; Sophia commanded, surprising herself with the authority in her voice. She stepped forward, raising the dagger. &#34;We&#39;ve come to restore balance, not to fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figures paused, their attention focusing entirely on her. The leader moved closer, its face inches from Sophia&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You speak of balance, yet you know nothing of what was lost,&#34; it said. &#34;The Leviathan&#39;s light was not just taken-it was corrupted, twisted to serve the greed of those above. That corruption now spreads through all waters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then show me how to fix it,&#34; Sophia challenged. &#34;That&#39;s why we&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The being&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;The healing requires sacrifice. Are you willing to pay that price, surface child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sophia could respond, Tharros pushed forward. &#34;She is no mere surface dweller. She is the light bearer, chosen by ancient magic older than even this place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figures murmured among themselves, their lights pulsing in patterns Sophia couldn&#39;t understand. Finally, the leader gestured toward the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then come,&#34; it said. &#34;See what your kind destroyed. Learn the truth of the abyss. Then we will know if you are worthy to attempt what none have accomplished in ten thousand years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they followed the strange beings toward the towering structures, Sophia felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cold water. The dagger throbbed in her hand like a second heartbeat, growing warmer with each step toward the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t trust them,&#34; Kael whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neither do I,&#34; Arin agreed. &#34;But we need their knowledge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros moved protectively closer to Sophia. &#34;Whatever happens, we face it together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, but her attention was fixed on the city ahead. Within those alien structures lay answers-and perhaps the key to saving Aquaria. But as they passed beneath the massive archway, the dagger suddenly blazed with blinding light, and Sophia felt something ancient and powerful reaching for her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth of the abyss waited within, but Sophia wondered if they were prepared for what they would find.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Echoes of the Lost</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blinding light from Sophia&#39;s dagger faded, leaving spots dancing in her vision. The ancient presence that had brushed against her mind retreated, but she could still feel it watching, waiting. When her sight cleared, she gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood in a vast chamber where the walls, floor, and ceiling seemed alive. Surfaces pulsed with soft blue light that flowed like blood through veins. Massive crystal columns stretched upward, their surfaces etched with symbols similar to those on her skin. But strangest of all were the buildings-if they could even be called that. Structures rose and curved in impossible ways, part coral, part crystal, part living tissue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t like anything in Aquaria,&#34; Arin whispered, her dark eyes wide with wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their strange guide gestured around them. &#34;This was Luminoth, first city of the deep. It stood when your kingdoms were nothing but dreams in the minds of surface dwellers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros moved forward, his golden eyes reflecting the pulsing lights. &#34;I&#39;ve heard legends of a civilization before Aquaria, but they were dismissed as myths.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not myths,&#34; the being corrected. &#34;Memories your kind chose to forget.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael kept one hand on his weapon as they walked deeper into the city. &#34;How can buildings be alive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They aren&#39;t simply buildings,&#34; Sophia realized, touching a wall that felt warm beneath her fingers. &#34;They&#39;re a blend of architecture and biology. Someone figured out how to grow structures instead of building them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guide nodded. &#34;You see with clearer eyes than most. We called it living architecture-a harmony of crystal, coral, and consciousness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They followed their guide through twisting corridors that seemed to shift subtly as they passed. Sophia noticed how the lights brightened around her, responding to her presence-or perhaps to the dagger she carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here,&#34; the guide said, stopping before a massive circular doorway. &#34;The Hall of Records. What you seek lies within.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door spiraled open at their approach, revealing a chamber filled with crystal pillars that glowed from within. Each pillar contained swirling patterns that moved like living things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are memory crystals,&#34; Tharros explained, his voice hushed with awe. &#34;I&#39;ve seen smaller versions in the oldest parts of the palace, but never anything this size or complexity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s dagger pulsed, drawing her toward a central pillar larger than the others. As she approached, images formed within the crystal-not just pictures, but threedimensional scenes playing out like a movie inside the translucent surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s showing us their history,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others gathered around, watching as the crystal revealed the story of Luminoth. They saw a thriving civilization of beings who commanded both science and magic with equal mastery. They witnessed the creation of wonders that made Aquaria&#39;s greatest achievements seem primitive by comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the images darkened. Conflict appeared-battles between the depths and the surface. Terrible weapons unleashed destruction that threatened to tear apart the very fabric of the ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The War of Tides,&#34; their guide explained. &#34;When surface dwellers sought to claim the power of the deep for themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crystal showed the desperate creation of a magical barrier-a division between surface and sea magic. The Luminoth sacrificed much of their power to forge this barrier, using the essence of their greatest guardian, the Leviathan, to seal it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They created the barriers,&#34; Arin realized. &#34;The same ones that are failing now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; the guide confirmed. &#34;The balance has held for ten thousand years, but the corruption spreads. The Leviathan&#39;s light was meant to maintain the barrier, not be imprisoned by it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The images shifted to show a terrible betrayal-surface magicusers stealing something precious from the Leviathan, weakening both it and the barrier. In its pain and rage, the guardian began to change, its light dimming as darkness crept in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what we&#39;ve been feeling,&#34; Tharros said. &#34;The barrier&#39;s collapse is allowing corrupted magic to seep through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael frowned. &#34;But why now? What&#39;s changed after all this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guide turned to Sophia. &#34;Ask the dagger. It knows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heart racing, Sophia raised the weapon. The moment she did, the crystal pillars all around them flared to life, connecting to the dagger with beams of light. Knowledge flooded her mind-too much, too fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The balance requires four powers,&#34; she gasped, struggling to process the information. &#34;Dragon, warrior, witch, and...&#34; She hesitated, looking at her own hands. &#34;Light bearer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; the guide nodded. &#34;Every ten thousand years, the barrier must be renewed by these four powers combined. The last renewal failed when the surface dwellers interfered. Now you four must complete what was left undone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stepped forward. &#34;How? Tell us what we need to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guide pointed to a doorway at the far end of the chamber. &#34;The Renewal Chamber lies beyond. There, if you are truly worthy, you will find your answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they moved toward the doorway, Sophia felt a growing unease. The dagger in her hand vibrated, warning of danger. She turned to alert the others just as the floor beneath them shuddered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something&#39;s wrong,&#34; she called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thin lines of light spread across the floor in complex patterns, racing between them. Before anyone could react, transparent barriers shot upward, separating all four of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; Kael shouted, striking the barrier with his fist. It held firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their guide&#39;s expression remained calm. &#34;The final test has begun. The Renewal Chamber will only open to those who prove themselves worthy-separately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said nothing about a test,&#34; Arin accused, dark energy swirling around her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said the truth awaited you,&#34; the guide replied. &#34;This is part of that truth. Each of you must find your own path through the city&#39;s heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The floor beneath them began to move, carrying each in a different direction. Sophia pressed her hand against the barrier, watching helplessly as her friends were pulled away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find the central chamber!&#34; Tharros called, his voice muffled through the wall. &#34;We&#39;ll meet there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful!&#34; Sophia shouted back. &#34;The city is alive-it&#39;s watching us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her platform glided away, carrying her down a dimly lit corridor, Sophia clutched the dagger tighter. The light bearer, the guide had called her. But what exactly did that mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The platform stopped in a small chamber where all the lights had died. Only the glow from her dagger and bracelet illuminated the space. Strange shadows danced on the walls, taking shapes that seemed almost human before dissolving back into darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; she called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A whisper answered-not from around her, but from within her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light bearer, you carry what was stolen. But are you willing to return it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Return what?&#34; Sophia asked the empty room. &#34;The Leviathan&#39;s light? Isn&#39;t that why we&#39;re here?&#34;</p>
