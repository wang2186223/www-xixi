                <p>Tharros seizes the moment. &#34;Sophia is not our enemy. She is our ally, whether you want it or not. And, if the prophecy is to be believed, she may be the only one capable of preventing what is coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After several hours of discussion, the council eventually adjourned. The chamber slowly emptied, with council members and bystanders whispering amongst themselves. Sophia lingered near the platform, tiredness tugging at her as the weight of the day pulled against her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did properly,&#34; Kael said, approaching her. &#34;no longer many could&#39;ve stood in front of them like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia gave a bitter snigger. &#34;I didn&#39;t sense like I did well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You held your floor,&#34; Kael replied. &#34;That&#39;s more than sufficient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin joined them, her keen stare softening as it rested on Sophia. &#34;You talked with conviction. That was what they needed to focus on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did it even remember?&#34; Sophia inquired, her displeasure leaking through. &#34;It seems like all we did was speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phrases carry weight,&#34; Arin replied sincerely. &#34;even if it doesn&#39;t look like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros approached with an inscrutable look. &#34;Tonight, the council will deliberate. They will not make a speedy decision, but at the very least they are listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia caught his look, hoping to find encouragement. &#34;And what do we do within the meantime?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; jaw tightened, and for a brief moment, he felt as if he held the weight of the water itself. &#34;We put together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia was unable to sleep that night. Her mind raced with thoughts of the prophecy, the hunters, and the rising pressure around her. She walked through the palace, the calm halls offering little comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she found herself in the mirrored image Chamber. The water transformed into itself, its surface reflecting the gentle glow of the bioluminescent crystals above. She sat beside the pool, her reflection staring back at her, faint but undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want from me?&#34; She whispered to the quiet water. &#34;What am I alleged to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The river rippled, even though there was no modern-day. Faint shapes began to form inside its depths, patterns she recognized from her previous connection to the power. But this time, the shapes were crisper and sharper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw the leviathan, its massive body writhing in the depths. She noticed the hunters, their sleek forms moving with lethal precision. She then recognized herself, standing in the center of it all, her tattoos flashing with mild as she held back the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vision faded, leaving Sophia breathless. She peered at the ocean, her chest taut with fear and determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;nevertheless chasing answers?&#34; A voice came from behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia turned to face Tharros, who stood within the doorway, his golden eyes compassionate yet weary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Constantly,&#34; she responded quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved closer, his presence grounding her. &#34;You can&#39;t find all of the answers here. &#34;But you&#39;ll find enough to keep going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, the weight of his words settling on her. &#34;I simply wish it&#39;s sufficient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; stare lingered on her, a flash of unsaid communication traveling between them. But before either of them could speak, a powerful tremor shook the chamber. The water in the pool rippled furiously, and the faint hum of the palace&#39;s enchantment became increasingly agitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s heart raced as Tharros stepped in front of her, his presence unsettling. &#34;something&#39;s incorrect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tremor returned, stronger than before. A deep, resonant hum rose from the depths of the mirrored image Chamber, sending shivers down Sophia&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; golden eyes flared with depth as he gazed into the pool. &#34;the beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadows in the Court</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The palace had transformed into a fortress of light and water, but this night it felt like a cage. The worry from the council meeting persisted, compounded by the foreboding tremors in the contemplation Chamber. Aquaria seemed to hold its breath, the currents stronger, and the magic in the air agitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros walked through the quiet corridors, his golden eyes studying the dimly lighted rooms. The day&#39;s debates had exhausted him, and despite his regular steps, the weight on his shoulders appeared unbearable. Each decision he made felt like a thread in a delicate web, with one incorrect flow threatening to unravel the entire thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia returned to her lodgings, fatigued but determined. Kael and Arin waited in the back, ensuring that the council dispersed without incident. Tharros was suddenly on his own, his thoughts a raging maelstrom that he couldn&#39;t control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he approached the large staircase leading to the throne room, a faint sound drew his attention. A tiny alteration in the water that could not have happened by chance. Tharros froze up, his instincts sharpening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Display yourself,&#34; he ordered, his voice ringing throughout the chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before everything, there was nothing. Then a parent emerged from the shadows. The assassin moved with lethal ease, wearing dark, scaled armor and holding a shining blade. The currents around them talked of violence, and the air was heavy with intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; gaze narrowed. &#34;You dare assault me right here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murderer said nothing, and the quiet was more unnerving than any danger. They lunged, the sword slicing through the water with murderous accuracy. Tharros sidestepped, and the strike missed him by inches. His hand lit with golden mild as he summoned his power, causing the currents to bend to his will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;idiot,&#34; Tharros hissed, his tone low and dangerous. &#34;You&#39;ll remorse this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The altercation became violent. The assassin&#39;s actions were quick and deliberate, and their blade was an extension of their will. Tharros responded with raw power, each strike of his magic sending shockwaves through the ocean. The palace rocked as their struggle heated up, bioluminescent crystals flickering in response to the pressure of their attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assassin became professional, but Tharros became unstoppable. He escaped a violent blow and responded with a powerful strike that sent the attacker falling into a pillar. The assassins recovered quickly, their expressions disguised under black masks, but Tharros should feel their mounting displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re true,&#34; Tharros said, his voice mocking. &#34;but now not top enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murderer charged once more, blade pointed at his chest. Tharros deflected it with a wave of his palm, and the pressure threw the weapon from their hands. Before the attacker could recover, he trapped them against the wall, his golden eyes blazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who sent you?&#34; He demanded, his voice a snarl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murderer fought, and their quiet was aggravating. Tharros tightened his grip, causing the water around him to vibrate with his barely contained wrath. &#34;solution me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could push similarly, a surprising explosion shook the palace. The shockwave sent Tharros spinning, and the assassin slipped from his draw close. Through the dust and turmoil, he noticed them retreating into the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruckus drew the palace guards, who prepared their weapons before pouring into the chamber. Kael and Arin arrived shortly later, their expressions dismal as they surveyed the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What occurred?&#34; Kael asked, his voice harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An assassin,&#34; Tharros remarked, his voice tight. &#34;They escaped at some stage in the blast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s emerald eyes narrowed as she assessed the damage. &#34;This was not at random. Someone intended you to be useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or wanted to send a message,&#34; Kael said, his attention shifting to the charred marks on the dividers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros clenched his fists, his rage barely restrained. &#34;They gained&#39;t prevail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to calm the palace,&#34; Kael said, his tone calm but forceful. &#34;if they got this near as soon as, they&#39;ll strive once more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take care of the guards,&#34; Arin said, already turning to leave. &#34;This won&#39;t move unanswered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia arrived as they were getting ready to act, her face pallid and her markings barely shining. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; she said, her voice filled with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A struggle for Tharros&#39; existence,&#34; Kael stated frankly. &#34;We&#39;re coping with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s eyes widened, and her attention shifted to Tharros. &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; Tharros said in a quieter tone than before. &#34;but this changes matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia drew closer, her concern palpable. &#34;How? &#34;Who might try this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros paused, his jaw hardening. &#34;That&#39;s what we need to discover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council reconvened the next morning, with the surrounds thicker than before. Whispers filled the chamber as details of the assassination attempt emerged. Tensions were high, and belief was scant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros stood in the center of the room, his golden eyes examining the faces all around him. &#34;An individual within these divisions granted the assassin access. This was no outsider&#39;s assault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council erupted in whispers, and accusations flew between sides. Veylor remained silent, his silver eyes staring at Tharros with disturbing calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t really trust that one person is accountable,&#34; a councillor argued. &#34;Who would benefit from such chaos?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Masses could,&#34; Arin remarked, her voice breaking over the noise. &#34;Tharros&#39; management isn&#39;t without its enemies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough,&#34; Tharros stated, his voice hard. The chamber fell silent immediately. &#34;This is not a debate. Whoever is accountable can be observed, and they will answer for their actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Veylor grinned, sending a shiver through Sophia. &#34;Ambitious phrases, Tharros.&#34; Let&#39;s hope you can deliver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the conference ended, Tharros pulled Sophia apart, his countenance unreadable. &#34;I need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me?&#34; she inquired, amazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re an outsider,&#34; Tharros said. &#34;You view things in a different way. If there is a conspiracy, you might say something that the rest of the people ignore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia hesitated, the weight of his request falling on her. &#34;I&#39;ll do what i will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros nodded, his golden gaze softening. &#34;I believe you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she exited the chamber, her mind raced with questions. Who would want Tharros to be useless? And why now, when Aquaria faces risks far bigger than political competition?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts were interrupted by Kael, who fell in step beside her. &#34;Be careful,&#34; he said, his tone critical. &#34;Whoever did this gained&#39;t prevent with Tharros.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I recognize,&#34; Sophia said, her voice steady despite her anxiety. &#34;but I&#39;m now not backing down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded, his admiration for her clear. &#34;suitable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, while Sophia reviewed the day&#39;s events in her chambers, a timid rap on the door startled her. She opened it to find a small package deal hidden on the floor, its surface engraved with strange symbols. Her pulse accelerated as she scooped it up; the weight was unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Internal transformed into a single shard of blackened coral, its edges rough and sharp. It was accompanied by a warning, written in strong, distinctive script: You do not belong here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s breath caught and her grip tightened on the shard. The warning was modified to clean. Instead of fear, she felt an overwhelming sense of dedication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever was in the back of this wanted her out. And that became the only reason she wanted to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Truth Beneath</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael stood on the edge of the reflection Chamber, his normally calm attitude noticeably strained. The flaming seas underneath him reflected the conflict in his heart. Sophia approached, her steps gentle but practical. She had only seen this side of Kael once before, during the conflict at the Coral Gates, when he said something about &#34;protective more than simply Aquaria.&#34;</p>
