                <p>Sophia&#39;s chest tightened. &#34;If I am, then we need to use that to our advantage. I won&#39;t let fear stop us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros put a hand on her shoulder, his touch grounding. &#34;You won&#39;t face this alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sophia could reply, an alarm echoed through the palace. Guards rushed into the room, their faces panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty, the Leviathan&#39;s forces are moving. They&#39;ve broken one of the outer barriers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted into chaos, but Tharros&#39; words cut through like a blade. &#34;Prepare the defenses. We move now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the group hurried to the city&#39;s outskirts, Sophia couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that the Leviathan&#39;s moves were deliberate, as if it knew their plans. The seers&#39; forecast echoed in her mind, each word a puzzle piece she couldn&#39;t yet fit together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived at the breached barrier, the sight that greeted them was worse than Sophia had thought. The onceglowing runes were dark, the energy that protected the city now a faint flicker. Twisted creatures rushed through the opening, their corrupted forms a mockery of Aquaria&#39;s natural beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold the line!&#34; Kael shouted, diving into the fight. His spear flashed as he struck, each action precise and deadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin stood beside Sophia, her hands sparkling with dark magic. &#34;Stay close,&#34; she warned, her voice steady despite the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia triggered her scanner, the device whirring as it analyzed the barrier&#39;s remnants. &#34;It&#39;s not completely gone,&#34; she said, her voice tight. &#34;If I can amplify the energy&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then do it,&#34; Tharros said, his dragon form glowing as he prepared to attack. &#34;We&#39;ll buy you time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The battle raged around her as Sophia worked, her fingers flying over the scanner&#39;s settings. The Leviathan&#39;s forces pressed closer, but Kael and Arin held their ground, their united strength a formidable defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost there,&#34; Sophia whispered, her heart racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden roar split the air, and the Leviathan&#39;s shadow loomed over the battlefield. Sophia froze, the scanner slipping from her hands as the creature&#39;s presence washed over her. It was overwhelming, a force of pure evil that seemed to drain the very light from the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia, focus!&#34; Tharros shouted, his voice snapping her out of her dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed the scanner, her purpose hardening. With a final adjustment, she triggered the device, a surge of energy rippling through the barrier. The runes flared to life, the gap closing as the Leviathan&#39;s creatures were forced back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group stood in quiet as the battlefield cleared, the Leviathan retreating into the depths. But its roar remained, a chilling promise of what was to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t over,&#34; Sophia said, her voice trembling but determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros put a hand on her back, his expression grave. &#34;No. It&#39;s just beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Discord Among Allies</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The palace&#39;s air was thick with anxiety. The Leviathan&#39;s departure had bought them time, but no one believed it would last. As Sophia paced the war room, she couldn&#39;t shake the thought that the seers&#39; prophecy had set something in motion, something far beyond their control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need rest,&#34; Kael&#39;s voice broke through her thinking. He stood near the doorway, arms crossed but his expression softer than normal. &#34;You&#39;ve been running yourself into the ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia shook her head. &#34;Rest won&#39;t stop the Leviathan. I need to figure out what the promise means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael sighed, stepping closer. &#34;You&#39;re carrying too much of this on your own. We&#39;re a team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Sophia could answer, Arin entered the room, her presence like a cold wind cutting through the warmth Kael had brought. Her face was guarded, her dark eyes flicking between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a problem,&#34; Arin said, her voice sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael straightened, his face hardening. &#34;What kind of problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My past,&#34; Arin answered, her tone laced with bitterness. &#34;My former coven has decided now is the perfect time to question my loyalty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia frowned. &#34;Why? What do they want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s jaw stiffened. &#34;To remind everyone that I was once an outcast. They&#39;re using this situation to sow doubt about me and, by extension, all of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s grip on his spear tightened. &#34;Typical. They&#39;d rather tear us apart than face the real enemy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s heart sank. The Leviathan lived on discord, and this internal strife was exactly what it needed. &#34;We can&#39;t let them divide us,&#34; she said strongly. &#34;We have to address this headon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s eyes softened slightly as she looked at Sophia. &#34;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re walking into. They won&#39;t listen to reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll listen to me,&#34; Tharros&#39; deep voice echoed as he entered the room. His golden eyes blazed with determination. &#34;No one undermines my council while I&#39;m king.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting with Arin&#39;s old coven was held in the Hall of Tides, a grand chamber filled with flowing streams of enchanted water. The coven&#39;s leader, Lysara, stood at the middle, her regal posture a stark contrast to the venom in her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin has always walked a fine line between loyalty and betrayal,&#34; Lysara said, her voice carrying through the hall. &#34;How can we trust her to defend Aquaria when her own past is riddled with deceit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s hands clenched at her sides, but she didn&#39;t rise to the trap. Sophia, however, couldn&#39;t stay silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Arin has proven her loyalty time and time again,&#34; Sophia said, stepping forward. Her voice was steady, but her heart pounded in her chest. &#34;She&#39;s risked her life to protect this city and everyone in it. Can any of you say the same?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lysara&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;And who are you to speak of loyalty? A surface person who&#39;s barely been here long enough to understand our ways?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros&#39; presence loomed behind Sophia, his voice cutting through the building tension. &#34;Sophia speaks with my authority. If you question her, you question me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell quiet, the weight of Tharros&#39; words pressing down on everyone present. Lysara&#39;s composure wavered, but she quickly recovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even so, we cannot ignore the risks. The Leviathan&#39;s corruption spreads, and question weakens us. Can you promise that Arin&#39;s magic won&#39;t turn against us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin stepped forward, her words cold but steady. &#34;My magic is the only reason some of you are still alive. If that&#39;s not enough for you, then perhaps you should ask yourselves who the real threat is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the room was evident. Sophia could feel the undercurrents of fear and doubt, but she also saw something else: the faintest flicker of understanding. She seized the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Leviathan feeds on division,&#34; Sophia said, her voice rising with determination. &#34;If we keep fighting each other, we&#39;re doing its work for it. We have to stand together, or we&#39;ll fall apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, the hall was silent. Then, slowly, some of the group members nodded. Lysara looked unconvinced but said nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meeting, the group met in Tharros&#39; private chambers. The mood was tense but quieter, the worst of the storm seemingly passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You handled that well,&#34; Tharros said, his eyes fixed on Sophia. &#34;But this isn&#39;t over. Lysara won&#39;t back down easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, her mind still rushing. &#34;We have to keep the focus on the Leviathan. If we let these divides fester, we&#39;re doomed.&#34;</p>
