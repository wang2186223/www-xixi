                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t always the time for department,&#34; he told me. &#34;We should stand together, or we will fall on our own. The Leviathan is our enemy; we are no longer separate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group&#39;s murmurs became louder, indicating a mix of agreement and opposition. The meeting concluded without a clear result, but Sophia&#39;s words lingered in the thoughts of many.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Sophia sat on the edge of her bed, exhausted. Arin came at the doorway, her look unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did well,&#34; Arin replied, entering the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia gave a vulnerable smile. &#34;It didn&#39;t sense like enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s gaze softened. &#34;It&#39;s the beginning. And sometimes that&#39;s all we need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s gaze shifted to the window, where the vast ocean stretched on indefinitely. The Leviathan&#39;s shadow hung in her imagination, serving as a constant reminder of the conflict ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going for walks out of time,&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin nodded. &#34;Then we make each moment rely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan stirred in the sea&#39;s depths. Its depravity spread deeper, and the whispers became louder. It had sensed the tremors of harmony in Aquaria and would not allow them to go unchallenged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sinister giggle resonated down the abyss, terrifying and menacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allow them to collect their energy. It will make their fall even sweeter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aquaria was in an increasingly precarious situation after the assembly. Citizens debated quietly while the council gathered behind closed doors. Sophia plunged herself into preparations, working furiously with Tharros, Kael, and Arin. She felt the weight of Aquaria&#39;s gaze on her, each glance a combination of yearning and mistrust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re watching you,&#34; Kael said one night as they studied maps of the outlying kingdoms. His tone softened, but his expression became more intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allow them to,&#34; Sophia replied, her voice determined. &#34;I am no longer here to prove them wrong. &#34;I am here to keep them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael grinned softly. &#34;Spoken like a real warrior.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elder Varyon, however, refused to budge. His faction&#39;s dissatisfaction grew louder, and their accusations sharper. Rumors circulate that he is rallying support to remove Sophia from Aquaria entirely. Tharros confronted him during a council meeting, his stamina wearing thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your moves sow department at a time when we need cohesion,&#34; Tharros said, his voice icy. &#34;If you have a plan to combat the Leviathan, share it. Otherwise, move apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Varyon&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;My aim is to protect Aquaria from additional corruption. We&#39;ll start with her. He pointed toward Sophia, his tone tinged with contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stood, her voice slashing through the tension. &#34;You do not have to accept as true with me, Elder Varyon. But if you stand in the way of what needs to be accomplished, you&#39;re no better than Leviathan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went silent. Varyon&#39;s look blazed into her, but he said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia entered Arin&#39;s mystical cloister that evening. The area sprang alive with bright runes and swirling power, providing a dramatic contrast to the worry outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Leviathan feeds on fear and discord,&#34; Arin explained, her hands weaving complex patterns in the air. &#34;It isn&#39;t only a war of power. &#34;It&#39;s a war of will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia saw the enchantment expand while her mind raced. &#34;Then we have to reveal it we&#39;re no longer afraid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin nodded. &#34;easier said than done.&#34; &#34;But you&#39;ve already taken the first step.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s gaze lingered on the glowing runes, their light a flicker of longing against the looming darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Tharros addressed the council once more. His voice remained constant, but the undercurrent of desperation became obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We cannot find the money for further delays,&#34; he told me. &#34;The Leviathan becomes stronger with each second we delay. &#34;It&#39;s time to behave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia advanced, her gaze sweeping across the council. &#34;I will lead the expedition to the outlying kingdoms. We want and need allies right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael nodded in agreement. &#34;I will go with her. We will bring back whomever we can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The council grumbled to themselves, but Tharros stopped them with a single look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it&#39;s decided,&#34; he said. &#34;Put together for departure.&#34; And may the tides guide you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Sophia and Kael exited the chamber, a sense of reason descended on her. The road ahead had become hazardous, but for the first time, she felt prepared to face it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Leviathan remained in the depths, watching. Its dark eyes glimmered with hatred, and its corrupting tendrils unfolded accordingly. It felt a stirring of resistance in Aquaria and enjoyed the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let them come, is the notion. They will only discover depression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the abyssal darkness deepened, the battle for Aquaria&#39;s soul began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bonds of Trust</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aquaria&#39;s educational grounds resonated with the piercing collision of weapons and the steady beat of drills. Sophia stood in the center, clutching her trident with shaky hands. The previous weeks had been exhausting, a whirl of teaching and strategy, but Kael was now demanding more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once more,&#34; Kael&#39;s voice rang out, firm and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s muscles burned as she rushed forward, her movements slower than usual. Kael quickly blocked her strike, his own weapon a blur of action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re hesitating,&#34; he remarked, his voice stern. &#34;The Leviathan will not provide you a two-dimensional threat. &#34;Neither will I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s chest tightened with anger. She strengthened her grasp, spinning into another strike. This time, her strike was faster and fiercer. Kael&#39;s visage changed, a flash of approval breaking through his harsh exterior. However, he did not give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better,&#34; he repeated, his voice steady. &#34;however no longer properly sufficient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s irritability boiled over. &#34;I am trying! &#34;What else do you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael dropped his weapon, his piercing stare fixed on hers. I want you to live on. To win. If you do not push yourself past your boundaries today, you will not be able to face a threat when it comes along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words cut through her fury, leaving the most effective dedication in their wake. Sophia nodded, wiping sweat off her forehead. &#34;Again,&#34; she said, her tone stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s lips twitched into a little smile. &#34;That&#39;s greater like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia hurried to Arin&#39;s sanctum as the sun fell below the horizon, lighting up Aquaria in blue and gold. The sea witch&#39;s location became a dramatic contrast to the reliant education grounds. The air here was filled with enchantment, and dazzling runes danced along the coral barriers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin stood in the center, her arms weaving complex patterns in the water. Sophia gazed, enthralled by the swirling currents that followed Arin&#39;s every instruction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re past due,&#34; Arin replied without turning, her tone amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia came closer, her limbs still throbbing from Kael&#39;s drills. &#34;Kael decided I needed some more rounds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin looked over her shoulder, her sharp eyes gleaming with amusement. &#34;I am not amazed. He&#39;s unrelenting. &#34;But so am I.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia moaned. &#34;splendid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s laugh became gentle but genuine. She indicated for Sophia to register for her. &#34;Hydrokinesis is not about pressure. It approximates precision. manipulate. Display to me what you&#39;ve learned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia closed her eyes and focused on the water around her. She extended her hand, urging the currents to bow to her will. A tendril of water rose, twisting and swirling, yet its movements were awkward and disorganized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Prevent fighting it,&#34; Arin said, her voice kind yet firm. &#34;Water is not your enemy. It is an extension of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia exhaled slowly, relieved of her frustration. She tried again, and this time the water flowed smoothly, mirroring her movements. A smile tugged on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Higher,&#34; Arin replied, nodding in agreement. &#34;But don&#39;t become comfy. The Leviathan&#39;s magic will disrupt everything you know. You need to be prepared for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s spine relaxed as she felt the Leviathan&#39;s point. &#34;Have you watched so we can prevent it?&#34; she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s eyes softened, a flicker of vulnerability passing through her functions. &#34;I believe we must attempt. &#34;That is all we will do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia detected Arin&#39;s reluctance in his words, as if there was something unspoken. But before she could press, Arin looked away, her confident demeanor snapping back into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s schooling became more intense as days turned into weeks. Kael&#39;s persistent workouts pushed her to the brink, forcing her to confront her anxieties and shortcomings. Arin&#39;s teachings taught her elegance, the precise balance of strength and control. Throughout it all, Tharros was a steady presence, offering empathy when her doubts threatened to consume her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros joined Sophia one night while she dozed on the palace balcony. The dragon king&#39;s golden eyes fixed on the distant bioluminescent glow of the ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re making progress,&#34; he said softly and reassuringly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia leaned in opposition to the railing, her gaze remote. &#34;It does not feel like enough. The Leviathan is more powerful than anything I&#39;ve ever encountered. &#34;What if I am not ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros placed a hand on her shoulder, the weight of his presence anchoring her. &#34;Nobody is ever truly prepared for the fights that rely. But you don&#39;t have to confront it by yourself. Remember the fact that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words washed over her like a warm flood, relieving the strain in her chest. &#34;Thank you,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tharros grinned slightly. &#34;Rest tonight. The actual work begins the following day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stood inside the educational grounds again the next morning, this time surrounded by Kael and Arin. Their combined presence became daunting, yet it also filled her with a sense of motivation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today, we&#39;re pushing your limits,&#34; Kael stated, his tone leaving no room for debate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin smirked. &#34;And teaching you the way to live on them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, her resolve growing stronger. &#34;let&#39;s do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The consultation became unlike anything she had previously encountered. Kael&#39;s workouts were severe, his movements precise and relentless. Each clash of their weapons sent shockwaves through the sea, challenging her patience. Arin&#39;s magic swirled about them, creating limits and demanding scenarios that forced Sophia to conform on the fly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael disarmed her at one point, his blade preventing a simple slash to her throat. &#34;By no means let your protector down,&#34; he advised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia clenched her enamel as she retrieved her sword. &#34;I gained&#39;t make that mistake once more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin&#39;s voice lowered through the tension. &#34;top. due to the fact the Leviathan received&#39;t display mercy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The depth of the training pushed Sophia to her breaking point, yet she refused to give up. She learned from each failure. With each accomplishment, her confidence grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the day came to an end, the three of them stood silently, their breathing heavy. Kael interrupted the silence, his tone lower than usual. &#34;You probably did well these days.&#34; &#34;Higher than I expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia maintained a sleepy smile. &#34;high reward coming from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin giggled, the sound easing the mood. &#34;Do not let it go to your head. &#34;The next day could be even tougher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia grumbled, but there was no denying the joy in her eyes. She became stronger than she had ever been before, and for the first time, she believed in her own strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Sophia sat alone in her chamber, the events of the day replaying in her mind. She recalled Kael&#39;s unwavering field, Arin&#39;s incisive wit, and Tharros&#39; unfailing understanding. They&#39;ve been more than allies. They were her anchor in the hurricane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, even anchors can falter. She&#39;d noticed the flaws in Arin&#39;s strong facade, the shadows that remained in her gaze. There was something Arin was not telling her, and it weighed heavily on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s thoughts were interrupted by a slight knock on the door. She opened it and saw Arin standing there, her look unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;can we talk?&#34; Arin requested, her voice unusually subdued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stepped apart, signaling for her to enter. &#34;Of the way. What about your thoughts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin hesitated, her usual self-assurance replaced with uncertainty. &#34;There is something you want to comprehend. &#34;Something about the Leviathan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia felt her heart skip a beat. &#34;what is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin met her stare, and Sophia saw terror in her eyes for the first time. &#34;It isn&#39;t just a beast. &#34;It is a part of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth hit Sophia like a tidal wave, sending her reeling. Questions flew through her mind, but one idea stood out above the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What does this signify to anyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Prophecy Unveiled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the room was apparent. Arin&#39;s confession hung in the air, and Sophia&#39;s mind was racing with thoughts. The weight of Arin&#39;s words sent her reeling. She couldn&#39;t connect the confident sea witch she had grown to know with Arin&#39;s fearful expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean it&#39;s a part of you?&#34; Sophia asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin sighed and paced the chamber. &#34;The Leviathan&#39;s magic isn&#39;t simply ancient. It has something to do with myself and my family history. My family served as both guardians and jailers. However, over generations, that relationship has twisted. Its darkness seeps into us, attempting to seize what remains of its power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s stomach turned. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arin paused, her gaze piercing. &#34;Because I wasn&#39;t sure I could control it. &#34;If I falter or give in...&#34; She trailed off, her voice breaking. &#34;I can&#39;t let that happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stretched out and rested her palm on Arin&#39;s arm. &#34;You will not. We will work this out. Together.&#34;</p>
