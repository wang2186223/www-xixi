                <p>&#34;That&#39;s impossible.&#34; Laura snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolf presence was increasingly getting on her nerves and the perceived closeness she might have with Delice was something she wasn&#39;t down for in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice tried to take a step but Laura moved in front of her in a protective stance, facing Zezi squarely, her eyes observant as she watched her every movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolf might have just been here to harm Delice because she knew that Delice was better. Even a blind person could see that Delice was much better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Creatures of all kinds didn&#39;t usually take lightly to competitors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was understandable and something inside Laura sparked at the thought of Zezi feeling threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should feel threatened, even more threatened when she was done. There was trouble coming for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing much. Just trying to steal your friend, with the same spell I used on your brother, seemingly that I have witchcraft at my fingers tips.&#34; Zezi captured air with her finger tips, imitating act of sprinkling nothing into the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi didn&#39;t get her desired result from provoking Lady Laura, she got the opposite result instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura flashed her a fanged smile, at her, turning to Delice with something more sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come for dinner, a surprise is waiting for you.&#34; Then she turned back to Zezi. &#34;Wolf, we should walk to the dinning hall together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi crossed her arms, not letting her disappointment show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This could be fun too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remind me when we became best buddies, I might have hit my head and forgotten.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure some pieces of paper will do well to gear your memory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi smiled. &#34;No. Your desperation though is suspicious. Am I perhaps your dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura snarled as if she had just been insulted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not in a million years will I take that unworthy stinky blood of yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t survive on drinking blood of other creatures, so I&#39;ll take a rain check on this one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, your puppy food will be on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi chuckled. &#34;Oh Princess, you are not doing a very nice job to entice me into this dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice&#39;s eyes planted to the floor, the tension in the air not something she liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this just be over already? She just hoped they wouldn&#39;t start fighting. Their last fight didn&#39;t yield a good result.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura couldn&#39;t even smile at her mention of that word. It had come out with so much vile that she couldn&#39;t even take pride in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you just that poor in your negotiation skills?  Disappointing. Your brother must know this and that is why you are not truly a Princess but being put in a position that is no good for anything but sword and violence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A growl rumbled through her chest. &#34;How dare yo---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dinner!&#34; Delice was certain she had never shouted like that for anything before. At least not recently and not like this. &#34;Dinner, dinner, dinner!&#34; She clapped along it, her voice a little shaky from the sharp shift of gaze of the people in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t give her a response so she pushed forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well?&#34; She gulped before an encouraging smile rushed up to her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really hoped they would just stop breathing down each other&#39;s neck. It looked like they would snap at any moment and she didn&#39;t want that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi took a retreated step back, her gaze fixed on Delice and the light relief that crossed her eyes when she saw that she was out to attack with a claws and fangs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like a completely innocent person, but Zezi knew better, even much better than she knew before the cause she was dedicated to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Manipulated people were always the worse. They were so pitiful, yet so determined to their false mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pathetic sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should all go for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flashed red for a second and Zezi marvelled in the sight. The aura of madness she had always felt from her had sipped our at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must be hun--thirsty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice had the potential of getting rid of whatever pathetic thing she was right now, if only she could just tap into this madn---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s thoughts screeched to an halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she had already tapped into the madness, that was why she was the High Pillar of a whole White Circle while being the King&#39;s royal Advisor at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was actually impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m hungry.&#34; Zezi declared with excitement, following Lady Delice out.  The glare she got from Laura was enough to tell her that she hated this new found friendship between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi wondered how she would look when she discovered that they were both planning to kill her precious brother. Not to talk of the fact that she was trying to play a match making Cupid with one of the leaders of the Killing Squad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just wow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This castle was one interesting place to be in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left the room and got to the dinning shortly after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice sat at the left and Zezi took a seat at the right. Leaving the head chair empty as they waited for the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi wasn&#39;t concerned about the food on the table, or anything, instead she was focused on planning what to do when the King arrives. This will be the first time she would see him after the full moon night. See him while she was awake at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how she hadn&#39;t noticed that Laura was now standing next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, Princess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura whined, biting down the urge to tell her to stop referring her as that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This chair is defective. You should move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one seat between where she was seated and the head chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you will nicely switch it? Why? Because you suddenly love me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A friend of Delice is a friend of mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi didn&#39;t believe that but she would let it slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took the seat and Laura immediately slipped into the seat she had been sitting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trick!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trick?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, the chair doesn&#39;t seem defective anymore. I&#39;ll just remain here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you trying to---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, will you please give the King this when he comes in. I have a favor to ask my brother and I think it will be approved if you did it for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you begging for a favor, Princess?&#34; Zezi cocked an eyebrow at her and Delice seemed even more confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here. Give it to him.&#34; Laura pushed the letter into her hands and Zezi&#39;s fingers stilled around the thin piece of paper at the words that were written boldly on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was one of Akeem&#39;s letter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did she get her hands on it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t think too long. The answer came to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen.</p>
