                <p>&#39;...12!&#39; she smiled in triumph and closed her eyes firm at his hum of thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every little action of his seem to elicit a new feeling in her that she didn&#39;t know existed, and that feeling always sent her heart racing in more ways than she would like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is an insult and a treasonous act to think that your King is stupid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; For once, since Zezi had had heard Oliver speak, he didn&#39;t sound any humourous, not even slightly to that effect. Instead, he sounded completely taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that you are here for Delice. Your proposal has done nothing in covering up your tracks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course. Thinking back to how he had acted in the kitchen, calling her his Sweet Bun and standing in her way, this definitely seemed like a strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sir Oliver really was a snake, a perfect match for Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good thing the King could figure him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not like it mattered to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he still hasn&#39;t said anything about accepting the proposal or not, and that was really starting to stress her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was even starting to count for her own breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is lie.&#34; He snapped, before a chair scrapped loudly against the floor and the thud of someone falling to their kneels, hit Zezi&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pardon me, your Majesty.&#34; He didn&#39;t sound like he was in pain, so the King was probably not doing anything to him. Yet.  &#34;It&#39;s just that as a friend, I must tell you the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Friend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, My King. The people are afraid of you. You soul sizing power is scaring them. They fear that one day it will take total control of you and you will I&#39;ll attack them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So his kind feared that he would be more monstrous than they were and attack them, like their kind attacked hers?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They should be afraid, terrified even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although, Zezi could not see it but knowing that the vampires were scared of their own leader, although it wasn&#39;t how she would had things if she got to decide, it still filled her with glee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their misery tasted sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone knows that as you are, you are already unstoppable.&#34; He stopped for breath but continued before eh could even catch one, like his life depended on the next words he would say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King must be getting angrier now. He must be frowning down at him, or maybe those black zig zag lines were already crawling up his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi let out a yawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been hiding here for quiet a while now and she was starting to feel really sleeping. She blinked, her eyes watering from the sleep she was depriving herself. She couldn&#39;t even risk dozing off her, her control would slip and they would know that she was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she wouldn&#39;t sleep, she was a war general, denying sleep was easy. As long as her inner self felt no ease around it&#39;s surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like this present situation she was in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you take Delice as your Queen, they will relent, knowing that there is someone they can turn to by your side. If you take Lady Zezi, they will feel further torn away from you with the fur breed. Besides, they are also weak as a kind. Your Majesty, don&#39;t letthe people go and seek for trust and security somewhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, I am the monster now. A little reminder, I became this to save everyone from my father.&#34; His voice was rather leveled but it was filled with so much anger, that Zezi&#39;s eyes had flew wide awake with alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver grunted a little in pain before silence filled the Library shortly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more the silence lingered, the more Zezi grew tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had they discovered she was hiding here? Was he killing Oliver? Was Oliver bringing evidence as a show to his proposal? Had someone else walked into the library?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was it so quiet?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The book flipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was reading again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was this vampire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bipolar?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want you here anyone, Oliver. Leave in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?! Why? Because I brought before you, issues that are stressing the people? Things I believe you should know about? I was only doing my duty. This is unfair, Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate your dedication and commitment, Oliver. Your papers are already by my desk, your duty as the Governor of the Left Province is done here. So, leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi would love for him to leave, but of he didn&#39;t, she was certain one day she would get rid of him herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had just committed so many crimes in her mind, her crave to out an end to him was starting to crawl into her priority list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should feel lucky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But as the Princess Chosen, I can still spend more time here.&#34; He sounded like he had a choice and when he continued talking, his confidence in his ground showed even more. &#34;I am here for my Laura. I miss her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King&#39;s continuous flipping was his only response. Between the quiet counting, Zezi imagined what book it would be that was taking his attention so much. She didn&#39;t take him as much of a reader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about a Bargain?&#34; The chair moved against the floor again, Zezi strained her ears to pick up the movement, her sleepy mind already making things difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed Oliver was sitting down once again. She wondered what he had been doing before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will give me more time to make it official with Laura, while I teach you how to make good steaks  to warm the heart of your mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Steak?&#34; He said with an half focused tone. He must be engrossed with the book he was reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An instinctive smile crossed her lips before she quickly frowned and damned the mate bond in her mind a thousand times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no need to seduce my own mate. Besides, what is more attractive than being King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;King of her enemies.&#34; There was a pause, the King must have done something became Oliver had quickly responded with a nonchalant, &#34;what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the urges Zezi had to fight down had just increased. She was now fighting the urge to creep out from behind the shelf and hide somewhere else, somewhere she could see them and not miss out on their little actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will still need go charm her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The topic had switched so quickly? How ironical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate your concerns for your future Queen, Oliver but you don&#39;t have to worry. I know my way around seducing my woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possessiveness in that tone and what it might have implied, sent her panting. If her heart should race any faster than this, she would just die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had said Future Queen, does that mean he hadn&#39;t considered Oliver&#39;s proposal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What tricks does a virgin of your age have you his sleeves?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s brows shot up in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Virgin?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not a virgin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me do the math. You definitely didn&#39;t have sex in your childhood. That&#39;s gross, you hate gross.&#34; With a click of his tongue, he moved on. Zezi could imagine him counting off his fingers, or just playing with his funny looking braided beard. As funny as he was in her mind, her urge to kill him was still strong. &#34;Locked up in the castle ever since you were fifteen, stayed in it for 200 years because, no choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi found herself listening with rapt attention. Was that true? Was he imprisoned in his own castle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been ten years since you were free and you still haven&#39;t gotten it ye--ah! Oh wait.&#34; A sudden movement. &#34;Maybe you like men?&#34; And with the sickest voice Zezi had ever heard, Oliver asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like me, Your Majesty? You can&#39;t tolerate a lot of vampires and you have been tolerating me for so long, could it be that you have feelings for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi mouth hung lose, her eyes wide with shock as she stared into the shelf ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What just happened?</p>
