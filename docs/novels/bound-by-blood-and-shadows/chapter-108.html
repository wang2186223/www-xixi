                <p>One side of her heart, wanted her to believe it was a lover but the other side had trashed away the option so quickly, it had gone right of out the windows of her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did it matter if it was another woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, that might put an obstacle in her plans. As he might pay more attention to the other person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the only thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her feelings had no play in this game at all, they were non-existent here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The music was melodious and as much as she hated the vampires, Zezi couldn&#39;t help but appreciate their taste in good music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instruments played in a sort of harmony she didn&#39;t know existed and somehow, she enjoyed it very much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around at the people and although she had planned against searching for him, she caught the King in his red robe, talking to someone who held the hand of a Lady in his. They both looked fairly young from where she was standing, so it was hard to determine the relationship of the two vampires standing in front of him. From their demeanour though, she could deduce that they were most likely siblings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another thing she had observed when she had finally seen the King in the hall, was that they were wearing the same color and how glorious he looked in that robe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that it mattered, the color of his robe or how glorious he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She strained her ears to hear what he was saying but the music came in harsh and loud, slamming right against her ear drums, threatening to blow them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next thing she saw though was that the King was dancing with the lady that had been in front of him a while ago, the other man was now gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, they were both alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle slipped past Zezi&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alright, she would need a drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any alcohol would do at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This ceremony was boring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could a ceremony lack so much life in it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolutely annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a makeshift bar at a corner, a little further away from the main place, and she had gone there, mixing different drink to get to a point of alcohol strong enough to make nonsense of this entire ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she was done, she might meet her bed with great gratitude. What about the White Circle&#39;s meeting tonight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, well, by the Moon, she would think about it while she got herself something to drink. It wasn&#39;t like she could actually get dead drunk anyways, it was never something she could do even if she filled her stomach with nothing but alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the vamoires&#39; wine for tonight might have a different effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, on to new adventures then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a deep corner of her heart, Zezi appreciated that despite how old fashioned the vampires were in most things, they made provisions for some things to balance out their lack of major touch with modernity and lack of complete utilization of technology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was, kind of, refreshing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mix of old and new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the wine stung her lips, she noticed that thoughtout the night the King had not as much as had a drink himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeding him the content of her bottle would be hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is the time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had asked a woman who had come for a drink herself, not paying her as much as a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;9:14pm&#34; she had answered with a giggle, not paying the person who had asked much attention to. Instead, excited about getting back to the ceremony, most likely because of the owner of the other drink in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>9:14 pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi sighed, looking deeply into the dazzling red wine in her glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By midnight, the White Circle would come for her and she would still have no solution for them yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they didn&#39;t kill her, she would die from mockery. The shame would be too much and her usefulness to the mission would be questioned. What was the point of having her if she came to them with the same results as the rest?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe they would even kill her and have Laura make the death tagged on the neck of an innocent fellow, or someone in the White Circle who would willingly sacrifice themselves to take the fall for the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi almost choked on air at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These vampires could kill her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as she didn&#39;t really value her life, she didn&#39;t want to die just yet. It was worrisome too that she was starting to have a tiny thought to reserving her life, making it have value to her, would make her powerless to many of the White Circle&#39;s threat and she didn&#39;t want that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what though, she had to find out a solution on how to feed this bottle to him before midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she glanced at the dancing floor again, he was dancing with yet again another person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow! No, just wow!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a glorious night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What an interesting turn of event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled, taking down the drink in a gulp and mixing another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A little bit of Sinalti will add a tinge of bitterness to it. There is always sweetness right after you taste the bitterness. You should try it.&#34; A voice said behind and she frowned, paying full ignorance to it while she continued mixing her drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was probably another vampire asking her for a dance. She would tell him what she had told the rest of he persisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me help you---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not in the mood to dance. Look for a partner else where.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I am not in the mood to dance either. I am here for a drink and I see that our interest lies in the same place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi rolled her eyes, finally turning back to look at the annoying fellow, only for him to turn out to be the man who she had seen speaking to the King earlier, along with a lady in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flashed her a smile, a second after their eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Silas, Governor of the Right Province. Let&#39;s keep each other&#39;s company.&#34; His green eyes was vibrant with energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first vampire Zezi would see that had more aura of life to him than Lady Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t mind absolute silence, sure.&#34; She answered, too wrapped up in her thoughts of the tonight events to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will take whatever I can get.&#34; He chuckled, mixing a drink and offering it to her. &#34;What is your name, by the way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi took in his clean, black suited appearance, down to the drink that he was offering her, before disregarding it and paying her attention back to the failure she was mixing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolute silence.&#34; He smiled, leaning back against the wall and flashing her a grin. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
