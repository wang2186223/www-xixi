                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; It almost felt like the question was directed at her but it wasn&#39;t.</p>

                <p>Of course, the King wouldn&#39;t take it lightly that his mate be given funny condescending names. Good thing she was about to destroy all the goodness he would ever see in her. After this, she would be ruined and she would finally be able to call that despicable thing all the dirty names in the world and he wouldn&#39;t have a say against it. In fact, he might even fancy one of the names and refer to her by it.</p>

                <p>&#34;I know you think I hate Lady Zezi, but Brother, she has been planning with some traitors on how to get rid of you and take over the kingdom. This paper proves it all.&#34;</p>

                <p>Not for Zezi though, it was filled with the noise of her heart pounding loudly in her chest, her gaze fixed on her wine goblet while her fingers  hand curled around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It just felt dangerous to be so idle at such a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the King was looking at her right now, she wouldn&#39;t know. Since he had stepped into the dinning hall, it somehow always felt like his gaze was on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she survived this, Gwen certainly wouldn&#39;t. Zezi would make sure of that. It puzzled her though, how she had acted like she couldn&#39;t read the letter and then went ahead to snitch to the princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How despicable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her act had been a very convincing one too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was foolish, letting her guard down around a blood sucking creature. They were all the same, she should have done something to ensure she wouldn&#39;t have left her room with her soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Zezi would have done to prevent this ever happening, she didn&#39;t know but still...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah. She would definitely not make it out of this alive. He will realize she couldn&#39;t be changed and if he didn&#39;t kill her after this, then he would change... for worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An accusation of such gravity should not rest it&#39;s weight on an empty sheet of paper. Please tell me, dear sister, that you have more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Empty? Did he just say empty?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, that was... puzzling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emp--no.&#34; Laura snapped the piece of paper away from him, ripping it in half as she checked through it. &#34;It isn&#39;t! Goodness, she is a witch. She has done something to you.&#34; She paused, checking through the letter again. &#34;Believe me, if it was empty the fur creature would have said something by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi felt heat breeze over her slightly. Laura must be sending her a death glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, this was a complicated situation that even she didn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was it that he couldn&#39;t read the letter and Laura could? She would have to ask Lady Delice after this, some time that wouldn&#39;t be suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The bitch knows that I got her and that is why she is so fucking sil--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Silence!&#34; The walls shook and the chandeliers above clattered as they vibrated, even the goblet in Zezi&#39;s hand, trembled. &#34;One more word and you will spend the rest of your long immortal life in the dungeon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only took a momet before he started talking again and when he did, his voice did not come across as a thunder like it had done before but beneath that calm voice certainly laid a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sick of this. Zezi is my mate and she will be your Queen whether you like it or not. I demand that you respect her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the reflection against her goblet, Zezi caught a flash of emotion in Lady Delice&#39;s eyes at the word Queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It must be hard to love and not be loved in return, painful too not to know the best way to love because of the lack of reciprocation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was sure she didn&#39;t want to be in Lady Delice&#39;s shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With large strides, the King got to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, quit the sabotage. One one silly stunt and I will ensure that the only light you will ever see after that will be the torch hung to the distance wall of your dungeon. Consider it mercy, dear sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slam!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You --&#34; Laura was advancing towards her but it happened so quickly, Oliver was standing in front of her, holding her hand that was now raised in the air. It must be causing a strain on his toes to have to stand on them like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was muttering something to her, probably something to her to calm her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was too nervous to know if it was working but before the enemy, she had to hide her real emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That made my heart skip a beat.&#34; Zezi chuckled, her gaze landing on Lady Delice who seemed the calmest she would ever be, although the slight jittering of her pinky around her goblet betrayed her slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have been scared to death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, cheers to that. I hope you will give this a break now, Princess. As much as you annoy me, I would hate to not have the honour of your presence. You know, it will be so lonely without you.&#34; Then she emptied the goblet, bottoms up before slamming it against the table. That loud slam hadn&#39;t been intended, but the fear that was running through her veins in waves leading her to put on more force into actions than necessary. &#34;Ah. Good wine and Goodnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly, she left the hall, praying that her legs wouldn&#39;t give way underneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was alive! Thank the Moon, she survived that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many times she had said she wanted to kill the King and even once she had even tried, still something felt off about this one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felt real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felt scary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of being caught wasn&#39;t so pleasant, not because he f the consequences like her losing her life but because suddenly it last felt that killing the King wasn&#39;t something she should be involved with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chuckle bubbled in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mate bond was really at work, before it would consume her, she had better be done with her mission here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost, about Gwen, she had better start finding a way to get rid of her for good. As much as this hurt because of the thought of Gwen&#39;s family losing her, Zezi had to force herself to look at this from the perspective of a War General.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some sacrifices just had to be made and Gwen would just have to be one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Zezi was at the door of her room. Pressing down the doorknob she realized something, the keys were inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sigh of frustration slipped past her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was locked and the keys are inside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, it seemed like she would have to pay Mr Grumpy a visit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or she might just sleep outside in the hallway?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, Zezi found herself heading upstairs to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t doing this because she wanted to see him, or anything like that. She was just doing this because it was necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she still hadn&#39;t thanked him for standing up for her yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would need them to be friends for her plan to work and that would be a nice place to start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was all a mission and her feelings are not involved in the very least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exactly.</p>
