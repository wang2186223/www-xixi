                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to be so polite, Lady Delice. I know I&#39;m late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver chuckled, his voice filling with excitement the more he spoke. &#34;To where? Maybe I can join in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The palace garden.&#34; Zezi snapped gently, watching as relief flooded Lady Delice&#39;s gaze and this time around, her smile seem to reach her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi hated that she was doing this and liked it at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated that she cared so much about a vampire to do this but at the same time, she couldn&#39;t just turn a blind eye to what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First she was a woman first, before a vampire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi knew she was no longer in this for the curiousity. If she wanted to know their history so badly, she could just ask Oliver. His mouth was a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>basket, words will sputter out. He would talk, she just knew it, even if that would mean enduring his annoying personality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clearly seemed like he had something to flaunt about it and for people like him, they always never pass up at the chance to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be easier to get the story from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I could join in? I want us both to get along and I want to catch up with my Sweet Bun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Delice,&#34; Zezi stated in a sought of correction, pulling his hand that he had thrown over her shoulders away and replacing it with her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was such a strange and unexpected movement that even Delice had noted that with a flatter in her warm smile, although she didn&#39;t resist it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I, will be doing lady stuff. Sorry, Sir Oliver but you are not invited to this one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike Delice, Zezi wasn&#39;t ready to smile and act like she enjoyed his company, so she had said that with a faim face of refusal that Oliver had taken with an even widen grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady stuff, uhn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that he was noticing it, Lady Zezi had a linger of dominance that appealed greatly to his pleasure senses. If she wasn&#39;t the King&#39;s mate, he would take her. Just imagining his face buried in-between her tighs while Delice rides him, made him slide his hand into his pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura would be somewhere in the background, giving orders while she touched herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fucking perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, it would also be plain death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His death, of course. By the King&#39;s hand, or maybe he wouldn&#39;t even get his hands on him, which would be even worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down his spine at the thought of his soul being yanked out and devoured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The consequences of his lust didn&#39;t worth pursuing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Lady Zezi was a werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which Vampire, in their right mind, would fuck a werewolf?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then.&#34; He went quickly to the table, pushing the plate of meat into Lady Zezi&#39;s hands. &#34;Sometning for you to snack on while you are in the Palace garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She received it without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some other time, Sweet Bun.&#34; He winked at her, beaming like a child. Zezi eyed him, feeling even more repulsed. There was just something about him that she didn&#39;t like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t like?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, she hated it. Not even because he is a vampire but, there was just something!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is Lady Delice to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said as Last Zezi lead her out of the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slammed shut and Oliver busted into a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was his Sweet Bun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how she fought it, no matter how many years had passed, that was who was, who she would always be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he had Laura wrapped perfectly around his fingers, which he sensed would be sooner than he thought, and he had his Sweet Bun wrapped perfectly around the other, something he also suspected would happen faster than he planned, he would take both of them to his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was his mission here and he wouldn&#39;t leave until that was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>_____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plate slid into the bin and Zezi dusted the imaginary dirt off her hands. There was no way she was going to eat that. She also didn&#39;t mind that the bin was right outside the kitchen and he could see it if he paid any attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze turned to Lady Delice and she noticed how her smile had faded away, probably sometime along when they had slipped out of the kitchen door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was really wrong with her tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was determined not to ask. If she asked, then Lady Delice might mistake her question as a sign of care and take it that she was no longer at war with her kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kind of misunderstanding wasn&#39;t something Zezi was in the mood for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Monsters of the highest tier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would be foolish enough to be at peace with that? Certainly not her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was still at war with them, she still hated the vampires for what they had done in the past and what they are still doing, no sorry past or back story about a relationship gone wrong would change that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing was that she was momentarily raising a white flag. Once tonight was over, she would pull it down and never raise it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she meant it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I truly have somewhere to be.&#34; Lady Delice blurted out, after watching the plate of meat Oliver had prepared get dumped without as much as an emotion from Zezi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished she could be like that with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely and totally indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi continued down the stairs and Delice followed, falling into steps behind her before she started walking by her side, as she spoke discreetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t even know where I am headed to, Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I do. The Graveyard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice stopped short at the mention of that, her gaze freezing on the bottom of the stairs they were fast approaching, before she got into action, her hand flying to hold Zezi by her closest wrist, who as a result, turned to her with a light frown on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve forgotten. You need to play undercover. Should we head back to your room, or do you have scarfs in your carriage, or are we going to rent a horse again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice shook her head, feeling overwhelmed with all the questions for only a moment before she could recollect her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My utmost gratitude for what you have done for me tonight, Lady Zezi. You have no idea how much I appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was. The over-thanking, over polite, no flaw Lady Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there was anything that personality ignited in Zezi, it was mistrust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That, she felt justified about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But my sincerest apologies, Lady Zezi, I cannot bring you with me. I understand that staying in the Castle, night and day, can be so unexciting but if you want to get out, you should ask the King. He will be glad to take you with him and there will be no need for hiding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fire ran through her veins as the image of the last time she had seen him had flashed in her mind. Shirtless and covered with hickeys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hickeys.</p>
