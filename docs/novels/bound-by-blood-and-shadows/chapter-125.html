                <p>She wasn&#39;t sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, by the moon!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to be selfless. She had a daughter to think about, her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a fair trade, wasn&#39;t it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To give herself up for her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a fair trade she had been planning to go along with from the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why make things difficult now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, maybe while doing this, she could help make things better for her people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just maybe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was worth the shot, wasn&#39;t it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>__</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door moved with ease at a simple push, and when she peeked in, Valerick was not in his seat. A guard had been of good help in directing her to his study, it was pretty easy to find him, that first rain aura almost knocking her to the ground immediately she came on his floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell engulfed her the minute she placed her hand on the doorknob and after receiving the permission to come in, swinging the door open had just been like opening up a dam of his scent that flooded her lungs without mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her legs had wobbled for a second but her hand clenched hard around the doorknob and she stabled herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to remain in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was another scent in the study though, one that didn&#39;t belong to Valerick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zezi, please stop lurking around the door and come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heard turned in the direction she had heard his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was standing by the wall and talking to someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi stepped in and closed the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For what she wanted to say, they would need to be alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first that neccesity had not baffled her but seeing him in his blue shirt, with a couple of buttons lose and his sleeves rolled up, she was starting to worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement pooled in the pit of her belly and she cleared her throat nosily to put a giant stop on the images that sprung up in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unholy images.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t expecting you.&#34; He moved fast and before she knew it, he was pressing a kiss on her forehead, a large palm lazily trailing her back, then he pulled her into a firm hug and buried his nose in the crook of her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes fluttered shut in pleasure and she found herself dissolving into his embrace, the spark that lit underneath her skin encouraging her to take this further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if he could read her mind, he pulled away, grinning widely at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always love seeing you.&#34; His thumb brushed over her cheek. &#34;A little bird told me that you have decided not to move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, damn that smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he always this beautiful?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Moon, was he always this perfect?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, that was a fact that was slowly settling itself into her brain, the more she subconsciously indulged in her feeling for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, he was always this beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, he was always this perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fated one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to see you,&#34; she moved away from him, looking at the lady who was in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lady took a bow respectfully, greeting Zezi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady,&#34; Her voice was light and her smile was radiant. She had green eyes that matched her modest dress, and her features looked so much like Silas if he had been a girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Iriysi, meet my mate, Zezi.&#34; Valerick slipped easily behind her, his hands cupping her shoulder while he dropped his chin to rest on her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart was racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Racing through all the miles that could possibly exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he always touching her, being close to her at every opportunity he had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he know what he was doing to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They haven&#39;t completed the process yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every need she felt was heightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he it feeling too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he doing this on purpose?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to search through the bond to find out but he was keeping his own end of it blocked, it would be harder to do that when they mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should she just do that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mate with him already?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she would. With what she was about to offer, it would happen and she would let it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But all in good time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the sake of poor Iriysi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zezi, that is the new Governor of the Right Province.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Iriysi glided across the room, her steps smooth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must be a great dancer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brought her hand up to shake Zezi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is a pleasure to meet the famous Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hah!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she remembered her. She was the one dancing with the King at the Princess Bonding ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even up close, she was beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are Silas&#39;s sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Iriysi&#39;s smile dropped at the corners, her hand dropping to her side since Zezi didn&#39;t shake her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry about what he did to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi felt Valerick&#39;s hand slip down her shoulder and go around her waist, pulling her firmly against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shameless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, so, shameless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This vampire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was someone standing right in front of them but that still wasn&#39;t stopping him from doing what he wanted. Although something told her that it was, in some way. That he would have done more if she wasn&#39;t here. Same as her, if there wasn&#39;t someone else in the study, she would have jumped him by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this bodily contact was getting too muc--</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thought screeched to halt when she felt anger shot through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was bitter but it had disappeared right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was Valerick&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after Silas was dead, he was still mad at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My condolences for your lose.&#34; Zezi said, trying to be done with the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t please her that her mate was angry. She didn&#39;t want him to keep thinking about that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Iriysi only shrugged, her green eyes glimmering with something as she looked from the King to her. &#34;It was good radiance, Milady. Believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, that was surprising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Zezi could say more, there was a knock on the door and Valerick spun her around in his arms, looking down at her, his gaze heated on her lips, before he moved his gaze up with something that seemed like difficulty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guess who is at the door?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? Why was he asking her that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can---&#34; her voice pushed through her tight throat and she gave up, her hands moving, anchoring around his waist, pushing herself to her toes to press her lips against his. The need to she felt was overpowering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; She struggled to keep her eyes open, but she was failing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His forehead pressed against hers and a raspy breath escaped her lips.</p>

                <p>Welcome, shame, absolute shock... and maybe her death, in a few seconds.</p>
