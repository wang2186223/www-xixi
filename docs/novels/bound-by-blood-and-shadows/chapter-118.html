                <p>It was werewolf&#39;s nature to show their wolves to their mate, almost immediately after they had found themselves, but since Zezi had been so against it at the beginning, the instinctive move had been so suppressed, until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you like to meet my wolf?&#34; Her voice sounded more like growl.</p>

                <p>Was this really happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had made a lot of research about werewolves after finding out Zezi was his mate and he knew how significant this was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barely agreed before her cloth had turn into shreds, he could hear every crack as fast as it came, every pop and replacement as quickly as it happened, before he knew it, his mate&#39;s human form had completely disappeared</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that stood in front of him was a silver wolf, with blue eyes. She was relatively huge for most wolves that he had seen. Reaching slightly above above his waist when he stood up straight, and that was to take into the fact that he was tall compared to many others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was magnificent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was lucky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went down on one knee, diving his hands into her soft fur and a purr of reassurance resonated through the wolf&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his hands moved over her face, staring deep into deep into her blue eyes, they reminded him of the oceans in his mother&#39;s drawing, of the clear sky he craved to see those many years that he had been locked away and used by his father. It reminded him of the warmth of everything he longed for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rested his forehead against hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for showing yourself to me. Thank you for coming to me.&#34; He paused, his hands slipped into her fur once again, grabbing a fistful in a gentle squeeze while he shut his eyes, as if he was struggling with something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it had been only for a moment before he opened his eyes again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile playing on his lips, he placed his hand at either sides of her face, her purring a reassurance to him that she enjoyed this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Zezi and I love you more, everyday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something glinted in her wolf&#39;s eyes and she pulled her head away from his hands, diving it to the crook of his neck instead, her cold nose rubbing against his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her closer, his hands reaching around her neck and holding her to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was acceptance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wolf had accepted him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had made research and found out that wolves had problems when they were mated to others that wasn&#39;t their kind, as the wolves would not have a partner in the other, that wasn&#39;t like them. There wasn&#39;t really much they could do against a fated bond but it was good to know that she accepted him, nevertheless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would hurt to have things otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was already having problems with Zezi herself and they were only recently coming around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, he didn&#39;t feel fur in his hands any longer, instead, there was body, warm beneath his touch...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...and naked, pressed against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled away slightly to see her face but she had tears glimmering in her eyes and before he got the chance to ask what was wrong, her lips had crashed against his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could breathe, that would have stolen his breath away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her closer to himself, pulled her away from the cold floor and more on his thighs as he slowly knelt down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips were soft against his and her kiss was slow, as if she was trying to unravel herself to him slowly, communicating things to him that words would never be able to do justice to. He kissed her back at the same pace, taking it all in, his palm pressed against her back and the other drawing mindless circles on her thigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled away shortly after, pressing her forehead against his, her eyelids shut but he looked up at her, watching the dark shadows that her eyelashes had casted upon the upper part of her cheeks, trying to figure out what emotion was running through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were too many, he became overwhelmed. He couldn&#39;t figure out the one that took the main control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she opened her eyes again, they were now blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up slowly, curling his black tie in her hands, making him follow her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zezi.&#34; He managed to say, confused by what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she the one acting right now or was it her wolf?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they even that different?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lead him to his desk, pushing him slightly against it, till he was seated. His eyes swayed down her naked body, and he groaned, his fists holding the edge of the desk in a tight grip before his eyes move to the door and a painful realization hit him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That door wasn&#39;t locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was closed, not locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand moved to his chest, unbuttoning his shirt, and wanting to throw it over her, but she hopped on the desk, sitting over his thighs and with slow, deliberate movement, she slid over his bulge, grinding against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice came out in a quiver, his shirt that was still in his hand, slipping away from his hold. His hands shot to her waist in a bid to pull her away and ensure she was in control of herself , but he had been too weak to actually do anything, that his hands had just remained there and he had thrown his head back when he felt her kissing his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mine.&#34; Her voice was a little hoarse from her building lust and her tug on his hair became stronger, to the point of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He groaned, feeling himself surrender more to her despite his fight to stay in control. It was the first time power had been taken away from him like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He resisted, he pushed, he fought but the more she mumbled the word and pressed it into the pores of his skin that he was hers, the more she claimed him, the more he felt powerless against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consumed by it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yours.&#34; His voice almost sounded breathless, he felt something grip him, then his hands clung on her waist, his claws digging slightly into her flesh that she let out a muffled groan and a hiss, something flashed in her eyes as she watched the black zig zag lines appear on his face, his eyes turning into black pools, the power shifting from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was way too easy to turn her around and slip himself in-between her thighs, his eyes lustfully feeding on her body. She felt high on having his attention like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those eyes as dark as the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed himself against her, if it were possible they would have dissolve into one by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left out short pants and gripped tighter against his silky hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mine. You. All of You.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyelids flutter shut and she found herself trying hard to grind against him instead as her other hand slid around his waist, pressing him to herself as much as she could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say it.&#34; He groaned, his voice low, dominating. &#34;Mine. Say that you are mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her eyelids were firmly shut and her grinding against him became desperate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slipped his hand down her thighs, and draw long strokes against her, in-between her folds, against her clit with light pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyelids shot open, her lips parted in a silent gasp before she bit down on her bottom lip and she choked out a moan, nodding her head vigorously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mine.&#34; He ordered again but she refused and he pulled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the space that had now been created between them, with his withdrawal, she quickly slid her finger inbetween her fold to replace him, scared to lose her building euphoria, but he pulled her hand away and she quivered beneath him with an unsatisfied cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; it was short and rapid, as if she didn&#39;t have enough breath to even complete the word. &#34;Please, Valerick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mine, say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand wrapped around his wrist, pulling him back inbetween her thighs, down to her core, already missing his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears in her eyes from how good this was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...and how much she didn&#39;t want to lose it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yours.&#34; She said with a muffled main while she nodded and look right up at him. &#34;Me. All of me. Yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had sealed the deal, his pace had increased and she rocked against his hand, his face buried into the croak of her neck, as he took her in till she quivered against him and reached her peak, moaning into his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that wasn&#39;t all, her teeth sucked into the flesh of his neck, marking him and in response, his teeth sank into hers, doing the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as he was hers.</p>
