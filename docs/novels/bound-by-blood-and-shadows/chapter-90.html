                <p>Zezi didn&#39;t know ease from morning till night. She had different worries filling up her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worries about Gwen and most especially, worries about the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite not still meeting Akeem and his so called High Pillar, Zezi had tried to still put her plan in motion, continued establishing the line of friendship that she was building between her and the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had searched and searched for him in all the non suspecting ways she could, but she didn&#39;t find him. At a point she had been even tempted to go up to his floor, but that would look too suspicious. It wasn&#39;t as if this was the Full Moon night when she could simply blame nature for her sudden uncontrollable intense desire to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she had, instead, made her presence available in places that she had hoped he would be, places she was permitted to be in herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t been there in any of those places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow, he was being really deblibate with giving her space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arrgh! That was the last thing she needed right now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she had retreated into her room, flickering on the light switch, before locking the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she turned around, she realized locking that door was a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Akeem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me for how I have come to you. The library was quite invaded at the appointed hour and beyond it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem nodded, folding his arms behind him and maintaining the distance in-between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was definitely the one sending all those letters and from the looks of it, he had always come into her room by himself to place it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he looked a little tensed, like he was not in his element and he wished to get out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he was scared of her, knowing how unhinged she was or maybe he just hated the fact that he was in a confined space with a werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t seem like one to have a problem with her kind though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there had to be a reason. She would figure it out later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go to see your High Pillar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he pushed for a while, as if deliberating on something. &#34;Are you good at climbing, Zezi?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What trouble are we trying to run away from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared back at her with a blank face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will need to climb out of your window to see my High Pillar. I won&#39;t be able to do that if you have fallen several feet to the ground and you are nothing but smashed bones and lump of bleeding flesh. So, can you climb?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s brows knitted together in a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save that tone for your kid, Akeem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give it to anyone else but me.&#34; She snarled into his face, tracing his face with her claws and marking it a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hissed, taking a quick step back. A hand flying to his face to touch the blood that ran down his cheek, before looking up at her in horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be sure to remember that, Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned away, disappearing out of the window while Zezi disappeared after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led the way and surprisingly there were no guards on the ground searching for activities like that at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, they slipped into someone else&#39;s window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frangnace of the room bubbled into Zezi&#39;s nostrils, her hands patting her dress as she tried to adjust the wrinkles on her dress, her as hurting like hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been so long since she climbed. She was really slacking on her training. Earlier, while climbing, she had almost called Akeem for help but after designing his face with that little nip, she didn&#39;t think he would be too willing to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He won&#39;t have a choice but her pride wasn&#39;t willing to take that insult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My High Pillar will be here soon, ple--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The creaking of the door interrupted them as someone came into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi froze, wondering if the person she was looking at was the person she  should really be seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe it was her sight developing problems. Maybe being in the cursed Vampire Kingdom was starting to affect her wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person stood by the door before the sound of Akeem falling on one knee took over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sounded kind of loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe her wolf was alright after all, or it could still just be her sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My High Pillar.&#34; He bowed his head in respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Akeem.&#34; She replied, flickering on the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi pressed her lips into a tight line against the smile the now discovered High Pillar was giving to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sight really wasn&#39;t tricking her after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow, wonders really would never end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Delice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem stood up at the signal of Lady Delice&#39;s hand. He walked up to her and stopped as if to whisper soemthing to her but she gave him another signal and he stepped out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, the door was shut and they were the only ones in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;High Pillar, uhn? I must admit, I suspected that you were dabbling into some thing but I had always guessed it was towards me, but the one you claimed to love so much? Now, that is a reach Lady Delice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love his Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure do.&#34; Zezi walked carefully, taking in the room. It was nothing extraordinary, just simple and comfy. &#34;You have a weird way of showing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have my reasons and you won&#39;t understand. Will you like to sit?&#34; She pulled out her dressing chair but Zezi folded her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reasons, she was angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That silly thing was always dabbling anyways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds like what every villain would say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is your reason for this, Lady Zezi?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want revenge.&#34; She stated like she was tired of making her intentions known over and over again. &#34;For everything your kind have done to mine, I want a pound of a nice royal flesh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something flashed in her mind and a not so pleased smile crossed her lips at the anger that laced her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That anger didn&#39;t seem like the usual one she always felt. This anger was directed at Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she so angry?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you the witch then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi scoffed. &#34;You still haven&#39;t answered me yet. Why are you trying to kill my mat--&#34; she sucked in a deep breath, clenching her fist and digging her claws inside her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This pain should be able to distract her from the mate bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;--the King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice blinked, pushing the chair back into it&#39;s position while giving her bleeding fist a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t like the blood, nor the fact that it was smearing her floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a moment, she was thrusting a pink napkin into her hands, while she cleaned the blood off the floor, and just as quickly, she was back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is losing himself, this is me saving him. The best way I can love his Majesty is to help this happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi dabbed the cut in her palm with a raised eyebrow. It had already healed anyways and all the dabbing was doing now, was wiping the blood away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The best way to love him was make this happen?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, that statement might have just made it&#39;s way into the list of the most craziest things Zezi had ever heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reminding herself to be nonchalant towards this, Zezi maintained her act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded like Lady Delice had been manipulated and the person who had done that, had done a great job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her moral compass, she didn&#39;t seem to know that this wasn&#39;t how to love a person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Actively planning a person&#39;s death wasn&#39;t how to love them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That almost sounded like an attack to herself, her instant defense being that she didn&#39;t love him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lady Delice claimed that she did, so WHY WAS SHE DOING THIS?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Woh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to calm down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn this mate bond!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to be in control right now!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let this mess her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right, I don&#39;t understand. Your feelings must be strong and sincere.&#34; Zezi gave her an acknowledging gaze and Delice&#39;s eyes glimmered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My intentions are the most sincere, Lady Zezi.&#34; Her smile brightened, like she had complete faith and trust in the words she had just spoken. &#34;I apologize for bringing this up, knowing that he is your mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi waved it off, the napkin in her hand that was now smeared with blood moving front then back from the little action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I didn&#39;t come here to discuss your feelings for the King. I came here to talk about the White Circle and the next step to take. I don&#39;t have all the time, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, of course. There is something I have to--&#34; There was a knock and the muffled voice that pushed through the door to the other side, didn&#39;t leave much room for guessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open this door, Delice. I have news to share.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, no.</p>
