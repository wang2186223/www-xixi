                <p>&#34;Mummy is sorry.&#34; She whispered, tracing the letters on the gravestone. &#34;Mummy should have done better. I know. Mummy should have protected you better, I know. It is all my fault. My son.&#34; She cried. &#34;It is all my fault. I didn&#39;t even get to name you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi fell to her kneels slowly while Delice wept, with a slow movement, she put her hand over Delice&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For tonight, she would cast it all aside. For tonight, she would view them as the same person, for tonight she would allow herself to comfort her. For tonight, she would be blind to her monstrous side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only for tonight, she would raise the white flag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice took the comfort in her action, her head resting against Zezi&#39;s shoulder, her face buried into the upper part of her chest, her hair brushing one side of her neck, while she wept and Zezi patted her back slowly, moving her hand up and down in a sign of comfort, not saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere along the line, tears had welled up in Zezi&#39;s eyes and she was crying too. Her heart aching for Delice  and the pain that her pain remained her of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The time went by and finally, Delice pulled away from her a sniffling mess. She brushed away her tears, her eyes red and puffy but she didn&#39;t look up at Zezi, her gaze was fixed on her grave instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two ladies sitting by a grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The rhythm of your heart is wonderful.&#34; Her voice was really low, as if she was afraid to speak any lower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi remembered the first time Delice had said that to her, how creepy it had sounded, how it had made her feel. This time around though, it felt like the most normal thing to be said. Sounded expected and lighthearted, despite the fact that they were both sitting on the floor in a graveyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This almost felt normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to question her thinking but remembered that for tonight, she had raised a white flag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How many white flags more would she raise for Lady Delice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I once had a beating heart too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi frowned, staring into the distance yet not focusing on what was ahead. She could feel confusion build in her and something told her that whatever it was that Lady Delice had to say tonight, she wasn&#39;t ready for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was once like you, Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once like her? That didn&#39;t sound about right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A werewolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand froze on Lady Delice&#39;s back and she sucked in her lower lip between her teeth in shock. Her heart was racing wildly and she could feel something jerk inside her at Lady Delice&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi didn&#39;t want to believe that would shake her belief in any way she wasn&#39;t ready for or make her perceive Lady Delice in another light, she wanted to believe that this confession was nothing. But deep down, she knew it was, she knew that this could change a lot of things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An incomplete one though. I didn&#39;t have a wolf and I was turned away at a very young age, for being a defect to the pack. Banished. Unwanted. A dirty rogue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi took in a ragged breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Banishment from packs because one of them was discovered not to have a wolf was very common, even up till now, many packs still did it and it was no surprise why. Having a wolf was an important part of being a werewolf, all the powers of a werewolf dwelled in their wolves. Their strengths, their weaknesses, it all had to do with their wolves. All these wolves must share a link, the pack line, and any wolf that didn&#39;t share this link was not a part of the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the only way the pack could stay connected, united. Unity brought more strength and the stronger the wolves, the stronger the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so important that back then in Ginov once a pup was a decade old, they always had to go through a &#39;Wolf Test&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down Zezi&#39;s spine as the memory of the first one she had witnessed flashed through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moon had been up in the sky, something she had later on discovered to be important to every Wolf Test. Werewolves powers were always at their peak when the moon was up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A girl had been brought to the ring and made to kneel in front of the Alpha, who had placed his hand over the girl&#39;s upper chest, with a commandment that she should speak. The Alpha&#39;s voice had been unnatural and something had jeered so much in her that she had buried her face into her mother&#39;s chest and wept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crying mess she became, all just because of a word that was spoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although her mother readily provided comfort, her Father wouldn&#39;t tolerate such show of weakness. She was the child of the Beta and she would set good examples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl had risen her head, but not a word came out from her lips that were tightly pressed together like it had been sew together, neither did her eyes change in color, at least that was what Zezi&#39;s tearful blurry sight had seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cries had rang from the crowd, the girl&#39;s mother pulling her daughter against her chest and begging for mercy as the Alpha stepped away from them like they were a plague.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi remembered the Alpha to be a kind person but that night, he had showed a different side of him and she had been made to realize that he had a wicked side, judging this only from the fact that the words he had said when he turned his back against them had made George&#39;s eyes turn glassy with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George was the son of the Alpha and  was a boy that never cried ever since Zezi had known him and since tears had welled up in his eyes, even though they never got the chance to roll down his cheeks, then the Alpha must have been the one to have done sometning bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had all left the Pack Center after that, leaving the Alpha, his son, the mother and the girl without a wolf behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi remembered that her mother had taken her back home and cried as she had locked the doors. She had then pulled her into her laps, and wept even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One more thing that happened was that, her Father didn&#39;t return home that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lack of understanding of what had happened allowed Zezi to live in blissful oblivion until the next night when her father had returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night was the first time she had witnessed her parents fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No hits, No physical violence but the words and the shouting was just as traumatic. It had been too much that Zezi had ran out of the house to the lake and they hadn&#39;t noticed because they had been arguing so loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was where she had met the Alpha&#39;s son by the river bank, crying. She had said nothing but sat next to him, crying too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They cried together, loudly and without restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they were done, they had settled in silence and before anyone of them had the chance to speak to another, her mother had come running, picked her up and ran back to the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words her mother had said to her that night had meant nothing but excessive tearful gibberish, while her Father had said nothing at all, his face hard and a glimmer of tears in his eyes. It had all meant nothing to her. But how could they have meant anything more? She had been only five and the only reason she still remembered all this, was because she had been blessed with an exceptional memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she was older though, Zezi understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had banished the little girl for something she had no control over, her mother had gone with her, ripping her connection from the pack&#39;s link, picking her child over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had gone rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for her Mother&#39;s tears and her Father&#39;s unspoken words that night, Zezi understood them to be her her parents fear for her. Zezi had showed no signs of having a wolf like most kids her age. Other wolves would talk to their human, making their presence know to their human, but Zezi&#39;s wolf never did that. Her parents had been beyond terrified that she would fail the Wolf Test when she became ten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only they knew...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up till now, Zezi couldn&#39;t understand why her wolf was different. Why her wolf never spoke to her, why her wolf never really felt like an entity on its own like George&#39;s own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead it felt like her wolf was her and she was her wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now as a mother, Zezi understood her parents fears better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi could relate to a lot of thing snow though, like the fear her parents had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as the Capital was enlightened, the Wolf Test was still a very strong practice. Also, the time for Mira to take the test was drawing nearer and nearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The problem was that Mira was showing no signs of having a wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi let out a shaky breath, moving her hand up and down Delice&#39;s back, not for the vampire&#39;s comfort anymore but for her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would love to blame genetics but Mira wasn&#39;t her blood daughter and Zezi was scared that she was indeed without a wolf.</p>
