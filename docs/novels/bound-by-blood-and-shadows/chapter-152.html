                <p>&#34;What gives you the audacity to put a royal Pureblood in these filthy chains?!&#34; The Princess&#39;s voice rang through the hall, bouncing off the walls, her glare directed to the guard that had just dragged her in and pushed her into the Accused box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her head, she accessed her surroundings, a formation that seemed so high, that it made her feel like she was in a pit, with iron railings camping her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the high chairs on her left side, different Lords were seated, while on her right, the Governors along with her sweet Delice, Oli. Behind her were the people.</p>

                <p>Next to her brother was that fur bastard whose existence was an absolute irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the Royal Court of Lavida, what an absolute disgrace it was to be in this box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura felt repulsed by everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stand in the presence of the King and Queen of Lavida, Royal Adviser, Governors, Lords, and the people, to speak in your defence against the accusations that you are the one behind the Volakys attack!&#34; That brought Laura&#39;s attention to the Declarer some distance in front of her (caged in his own box and sharing her pit) noticing how his pastel blue distinguishing with silver tappings didn&#39;t get enough ironing before fully processing what he had just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Volakys attack?!&#34; The words tasted bitter on her tongue, like some foul audacity. Her claws itched to dig into that filthy dog&#39;s neck. It could only be her behind this insanity! What a fucking bastard! &#34;Who accused me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Investigative Council, Princess.&#34; The Declarer replied, adjusting his glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura frowned, looking straight at the one seated on the crown, her confused gaze clashing against his cold own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My own brother?&#34; It was a faint whisper, infused with hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Volakys have been kept in the dungeon beneath the castle for more than ten years now. Only you and I know how to get in and get out.&#34; The King spoke, his calm and unfazed voice commanding every bit of attention and reigning fear. &#34;Provide the key to the den that is your possession and speak in your defense, if your words render you guiltless, you shall be well compensated for the damage this trial will bring upon your reputation, but if you are found guilty, your soul shall be consumed, your flesh fed to the vultures of the air and your blood one with the Execution Ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s blood ran cold in her veins, as she sat unmoving in her chair. She had been a little relieved when she realized that she hadn&#39;t been dragged here for a trial but to witness one. Now, that relief was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Volakys had been in the dungeon beneath the castle for more than ten years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were keys to that dungeon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had so many questions, that she was afraid the answers wouldn&#39;t come to her on time. She still hadn&#39;t been able to speak to Valerick at all even though she was seated right next to him. He wouldn&#39;t talk to her through the mind link, he wouldn&#39;t even look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was so annoying!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wouldn&#39;t even look at her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he really doing this to his sister? If he were to find out about what she had done, what would he do to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother, you can&#39;t do this to me, I am---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak in your defense, do not appeal to my sympathy. I have none and this is pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall was as quiet as a graveyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, Zezi looked at Valerick, and just as he had been doing the whole night, he ignored her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not do it. I did not do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you accuse your King?&#34; He asked with the most bored expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would never accuse my own brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call on witnesses to speak in your defence then, since you have no words of your own to absolve you of this guilt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage spread through the Princess&#39;s features like a virus. She bit her tongue, stopping herself from saying words that would her soul in more danger than it was already in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Provide the key, Princess Laura.&#34; A key dangled from one of Valerick&#39;s claws before he tossed it on the table. &#34;This is mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurings filled the hall, from the people, the Governors, and the Lords. Lady Delice stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is your key?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King leaned back into his seat and something about his aura made him feel like a stranger to Zezi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt distant. She had never seen him like this before, and something about that made her think of her mother&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your silence is forcing my hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura shook her head, she wasn&#39;t thinking anymore now. Her thoughts were running over one another. She was trembling slightly as a mad search went through her brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this a setup? It felt like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>THAT FUR BASTARD!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take her to the Execution Ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valerick.&#34; In a harsh whisper, his name slipped past Zezi&#39;s lips without thinking, and he finally looked at her, a look that silenced her immediately. There was just so much rigidity and annoyance in his eyes, that made her blood run cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her like she was a fly and he was displeased with her unnecessary buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he would dispose of her if she made another attempt to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was something he was capable of, somehow she had been made to forget that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was nothing compared to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made Zezi sink back into her seat with bated breath, hearing the Princess&#39; loud struggles and the chaotic murmurs of everyone play in the background of her mind, while she wished with all her heart that he would stop looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish to confess! I wish to confess!&#34; The Princess finally shouted, and Valerick looked away from her, signaling to the guards to let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One word did he say that changed everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Confess.&#34;</p>
