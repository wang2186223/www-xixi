                <p>That name burned her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt to refer to the wolf like she was a being deserving of been appraised as someone with quality but Laura was ready to do anything to get her brother to go to the dinner. Even if that anything would mean calling the wolf low life by her name, instead of all the other derogatory terms that lived rent free in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would do all that and more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brother took a step forward, and her heart raced with fear, his anger rolling from him in waves, rushing into her lungs and threatening to choke her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We all are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura pushed back again her fear and look up right at him but it was only a moment, before she was looking pass his shoulder instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was what she always did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never looked at him, he was too fearful to be looked upon but she had always managed to keep her head straight while her eyes pass over his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides, I have an announcement, a surprise. Two surprises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned away, picking up a towel and wiping it over the green vile before tossing it to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was unusual, he hated that green vile and he probably didn&#39;t mind it only because he was way too angry to care right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought that what was getting him mad right now could be the wolf made her heart rejoice, but the more time she spent without an answer from him, the more she got stressed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in dangerous mode, she really hoped that he wouldn&#39;t turn on her and start trying to seize her soul. He wouldn&#39;t actually seize it but just tugging at it was painful enough. She still hadn&#39;t healed from last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother, pleaseeeee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not a whining child, quit it.&#34; His voice didn&#39;t hold as much anger as before, and she bit down a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be way too early to rejoice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that she had said Zezi was amongst those waiting might have helped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could one being give two different emotions to one person?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura couldn&#39;t wait till she would finally be able to get rid of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a tired sigh, like one would do to a pestering child while being won over by that child&#39;s pestering demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura always looked to him, like a kid. Like she didn&#39;t grow a day older since the responsibility of taking care of her had fallen on his shoulders, that had been way before their parents&#39; death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, she would always remain someone that he needed to be protected. If he could have it his way, he wouldn&#39;t even have her leading his army, he would have her protected somewhere. But from experience, he knew that was a terrible tactic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was precious to him, his baby sister and the only one that could annoy the hell out of him in this matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I will be joining you shortly. Happy now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a suppressed giggle, she nodded, exiting the room and closing the door shut behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King turned back to the mirror, only to see the green  horror that he was. His face filled with grimace, the stench seem to suddenly hit the roof of his nose, filling the base of his tongue with bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yuck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to get this off!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had rushed into the dinning hall, with a goofy smile that seem like it would split his face apart and an apology at the tip of his tongue for coming late. When he realized that Last Zezi was the only one at the table, his goofy smile had tugged up into a flirty smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had thrown a wink her way, well almost, halfway he had suddenly stiffened and went for a bow instead. While he switched from all these formed of greetings, Zezi&#39;s attention was on his braided beards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It never ceased to amuse her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir Oliver.&#34; He settled into the reasonably farthest seat away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi stiffled a giggle, remembering his encouter with the King, an encouter he most certainly didn&#39;t know she had been an audience to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be hungry.&#34; He declared in a carefree tone. Then the next thing, the chair was pushing back again while his eyes glinted with an idea. &#34;I will ensure that the Cook brings in your favorite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Zezi could protest, he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of being served blood steak irked her and she would have stood up to ensure that wouldn&#39;t be happening if she hadn&#39;t had bigger fish to fry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The letter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura definitely wanted to show it to the King and if everyone could see it, then they were in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after Laura had left, Zezi had gone to the kitchen to seek Delice opinion on what was on ground, but she had little to say, telling her they should only hope on luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What rubbish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was luck without tactic?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One couldn&#39;t just base their survival on luck. There needed to be more, more of something that at least had a better measure of assurance to back it up. But Delice seem like she wasn&#39;t searching for anything and Zezi had been left with no choice but to return to the dinning table, while she deliberated on what next to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been better alone anyways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Few moments after Oliver had disappeared into the Kitchen, Zezi could hear muffled voices, catch some of the words they said no matter how hushed they tried to make it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...I love you. It&#39;s always been you.&#34; Oliver&#39;s voice wasn&#39;t as goofy as always, instead it sounded like a desperate plead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cheated... my best friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only I.... Suffer... Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is my best friend! You are the problem and so... I must cut you off for---&#34; there was a rustle. &#34;Let me go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me taste you. Please, just this once. I&#39;ve been starving without you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oli--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My sweet Bun, just a flick, I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s hands clenched into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That bastard!</p>
