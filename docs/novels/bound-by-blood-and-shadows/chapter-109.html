                <p>Silas had been trying to keep quiet as much as he could, so much that Zezi had even forgotten that he was there for a second, until he finally couldn&#39;t contain his curiousity anymore and he opened his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder. What is a werewolf looking for in Lavida?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi frowned, looking down at the content in her glass, trying to figure out if the spinning feeling in her head was real or she was just imagining it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For a Governor, I assumed you would have heard the news.&#34; She chuckled, finding nothing about his presence interesting nor the line of conversation he had picked to communicate on, amusing in the least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he just go away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anger flared up the more he lingered by her side but she was in no mood for an argument or anything that would require too much explaining from her that she hadn&#39;t told him to leave yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the time was right, she would just walk away. The only thing she was starting to like and hate about this makeshift bar was that the King had moved away and she couldn&#39;t see him anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she wouldn&#39;t even be able to figure out what he was doing. What if he was doing something that could potentially ruin her mission, she wouldn&#39;t know because she couldn&#39;t see him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What news?&#34; Silas whispered, his voice scratching her ears, repulsion doubling in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked around briefly, brushing his hand over his clean, very low, black, hair cut, before he closed up the distance between them, leaning down towards her, and flashing her a suggestive grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me.&#34; He licked his lips and that was it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single act ticked her off completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her glass a little to the front, pouring it right on his suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no.&#34; She declared flatly. &#34;Now your fine suit is ruined. You will have to excuse your self and take care of that. I am so sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That apology lacked every bit of remorse. She just sounded bored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silas chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s black,&#34; he replied with a shrug. &#34;Black can accommodate everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This vampire couldn&#39;t take a hint even if it was waving right in his face, even if someone whispered it into his ears, he would still remain ignorant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I can&#39;t.&#34; She shoved him in his chest, pushing him away. &#34;I&#39;m done with this boring conversation. Have a fine evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not looking back, she excused herself from the ballroom, but not before casually making herself another glass of wine and taking it along with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was someone really addictive about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t so quiet outside, the music from the ballroom still sipped into the air but this place didn&#39;t feel quiet crowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It almost seemed empty as more guests were inside the ballroom. Zezi assumed what importance this ceremony might be for others that weren&#39;t the celebrated mates, a time to meet other vampires and most likely hit something off from there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air, as fresh as it felt, still felt a little off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was just this small spinning feeling in her head. With an aggressive shake, she fought it and it cleared away for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally felt the fog clear away, she found herself in a maze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did she get here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, the castle had a maze?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she just learning of this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had better get out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she took a step further though, she stumbled slightly, pushing herself against the grass of wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was surprisingly strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was someone helping her stand straight though, before she could even attempt to do it herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged his hands off, her eyes sharp with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You followed me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you would get drunk and need help. That is too strong for a werewolf.&#34; He gestured towards the glass. &#34;I&#39;m even surprised you can still walk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s heart pounded with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt really weary around this vampire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they the only one in their maze?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your dress looks really stunning by the way. I like the way you are putting yourself out there with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was certain that this wasn&#39;t one of the reasons she had done this. She wouldn&#39;t be very happy with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What you like is none of my business. I am not trying to please you.&#34; She side stepped him, walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But fortunately for you, you have. I can make your life better than what you are right now. By my side is a better option. You have hit the jackpot with me.&#34; He walked closer to her, leaning towards her ear and whispering. &#34;You are certainly are the luckiest tonight, because you have my attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi chuckled, a dry and long laughter, without even giving him a response she turned away but he grabbed her arm quickly and the way his palm felt her skin, made her skin crawl with disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me now or---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or what?&#34; His grip only tightened and excitement glimmered in his green eyes. The shadows behind him made her heart skip a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one refuses me. Especially not when they are free to take and their blood most certainly sweet to taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if her evening wasn&#39;t already going wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The alcohol swept right out of her system, the dizziness replaced with a sense of alert, her andranaline taking control as her eyes flashed blue. She raised her left hand to swipe her claws across his face but he countered her attack quickly, feeling overconfident by it that he didn&#39;t notice when she raised her right hand with the glass in it, smashing it right into his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head moved to the left with the force that although he should have seen coming, he had underestimated her strength so much that he hadn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi took a step back, watching Silas pull out the glass pieces from his skin, none had gotten into his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished it had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cut had healed up in seconds and her awareness of the kind of danger he was increased. The cuts on her hand had healed at a slower pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t we all love a little bit of feistiness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for her hand and she slide away from his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare touch me again, or you will not live to see the light of day. Don&#39;t you know who I am?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed, laughter mixed with short snorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
