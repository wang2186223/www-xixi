                <p>The day had not passed as quickly as Zezi had wished it to, and neither did the night that followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to entertain Gwen&#39;s food visit and act normal. Otherwise, Gwen might suspect not only that she was planning to do something but what exactly she was planning to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As loyal as Gwen had seemed to prove herself to be, Zezi was certain that she wouldn&#39;t approve of her taking her own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen was obsessed with the idea of having a Queen, she always had been from the very start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever would stand in the way of that not happening would definitely not earn her support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, Zezi acted as normally as she could, thanking her for her participation in saving her family&#39;s life over and over again, while she asked questions about the Castle and the customs of Lavida.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disregarding the thought that her Lady might be moving on too quickly from the abrupt loss of her family, Gwen was more than delighted to enlighten the future Queen about all she needed to know moving forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, she was overjoyed that she was taking this step, and so as not to cause her a relapse or rethink, she deliberately stayed away from any talk that might bring that up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was back to the way it used to be; with her family out of the Castle, she locked up in a room, and vampires guarding the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyways, she would only have to endure this for a few more hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real thought that burdened her heart was not being able to talk to her family, not being able to use the pack link to talk to Aunt Alice, and the look in George&#39;s eyes when he realized that giving up was the only option they were stuck with, the way her daughter had been crying because the evil blood in her had made her hurt George.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all burned into her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took everything in her, not to break down and just cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, the day had rolled into the night, and the next morning without her having to deal with meeting the King or him summoning her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was entirely glad about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like Fate was on her side for once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a while since she felt so lucky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face basked in the gentle ray of the morning sun, finally it was today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi smiled as her gaze passed over the other side of the castle. Below, there were servants walking around, some with horses. Then, there were warriors, walking behind a person that was unmistakably, Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That dagger is worth more than your souls. Find it!&#34; Laura snapped at the guards behind her. She looked up briefly to catch Zezi staring down at her but she looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had more important things to do right now than bother herself with a wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi chuckled as she watched them in distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today started great, alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen caught a glimpse of her laughing mistress as she set up her table for breakfast. Observing the great mood she was in, her curiosity peaked and she asked her why she was happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today is just a perfect day.&#34; That was Zezi&#39;s vague answer before she settled down to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then night came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen had come in as usual, and served her dinner. As much as she was glad that her Lady had moved on, Gwen couldn&#39;t help but finally ask her Mistress if she was missing her family and if there was any way for her to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she was just bottling it all up and needed a safe space to release it all. In one of the books Lady Delice had once given to her, she had read that one could never really move on, until proper closure was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Lady had moved on too fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she even have proper closure?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Zezi shook her head, a smile on her face. &#34;You have already done enough. You are a wonderful mother, Gwen, I hope your kids appreciate that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My bats? Of course, they do.&#34; She said, wheeling out the trolley. &#34;Are you sure there is nothing I can do, Milady?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Gwen. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really.&#34; She dropped her fork gently on her place, holding Gwen&#39;s gaze in deep unfiltered gratitude. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are welcome, Milady. Alright then.&#34; She said with a chuckle, returning to a conversation they were having before and saying she would tell her husband and kids about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen never got tired of telling her family about the things that came up during her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi just hoped she would spare them the gory details of the state of her room and body when she would be narrating her death to her family the next day or that very night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door shut firmly and Zezi flicked off the light, leaving the room in absolute darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden wave of aloofness hit her and she hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That emotion, was without a doubt, not hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadness crept over her, then a distant worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One that made her a little agitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ahhhhh! She hated this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These emotions were all the King&#39;s. She usually felt them when they were at the peak and she had been dealing with it since the moment she opened her eyes. The more these feelings seeped through her veins, the more she remembered why, and the more she felt like ending it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if she didn&#39;t already have it bad with the mate bond, this connection was nothing but pure torture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the feelings of an enemy. What could be worse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand slipped under her dressing table, pulling out the stolen dagger she had carefully hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only a surprise that Lady Laura wasn&#39;t questioning her yet, she seemed to be searching for it vigorously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again, she understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mere wolf, stealing her most precious dagger from her, a vampire, the Right hand to the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That line of thought was exactly what Zezi had been banking on, and she was more than happy to know that it was working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her finger hovered on the blade, swiping across the glittering sharp edge of the dagger, that seemed to glitter under the moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slash!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a blink, she let the blade slit her throat in a sharp line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain that went through her was quick, she dropped to her knees with a thud, her blood flowing down the white gown she had decided to wear for tonight, a tiny smile stretching to her lips as her eyes glistened with her pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart was losing its beats, her hand losing its grip and her sight fading away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>History.</p>
