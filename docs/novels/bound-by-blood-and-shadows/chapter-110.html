                <p>Words tried to tear out of her mouth but they got stunk in her throat, even she wasn&#39;t convinced of the position she was about to claim for her safety. In that moment of slight shakiness, she realized that she had been surrounded with more of Silas men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know who you are.

He didn&#39;t even introduce you to anyone tonight and he has danced with plenty.&#34;</p>

                <p>What seemed to unexpectedly hurt though, was that, was that what everyone else thought of her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you know what this means?&#34; His smile broadened. &#34;It means you are free for all to take. No consequences what so ever, and I love free things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tightened her fists, shaking off Silas words not to have effect on her, instead readying herself to take them down even if it would cost her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the good side, maybe the training with Laura would finally come to good use and she could thank her just to spite her further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about reeling the Princess off had always felt good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They launched themselves at her, all attacks aiming to pull her down, to render her immobile to their thirst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was stubborn and very well trained. Despite what she was, she was able to slash through and have a good cut at them. Whosoever these vampires were, their level of fighting skills was no match for her, the only problem right now was that despite how good she was at fighting them, they weren&#39;t dying and she was increasingly getting weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, someone claw straight into hand, pinning her down to the wall, another on the other hand and two others on her legs, pulling them apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was indeed strength in numbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damnit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fought against their hold but blood was gushing out her cuts and she was growing increasingly weak too. The blood loss and the physical strain she had gone through with all those fighting wasn&#39;t helping too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement glimmered in the Silas&#39;s eyes, as he wiped away blood from his upper lip, that had spilt in half, quickly healing too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi smiled as she remember how that had got there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished she could claw at him some more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no idea how horny this sight makes me. Helplessness...&#34; He hummed, his eyes raking over her body, &#34;we just need to wipe that smile off your face and it will be complete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snarled, accompaning it with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sick blood sucking bastards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I am done with you, you will love to be taken this way, you will beg and desire only this. You will search for me,&#34; he moved closer, almost dropping to his knees inbetween her. &#34;And I will willing accept you into my House and give you this little dog place in my harem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fvck?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As vampires got closer, Zezi wondered where the King was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that shouting about his main goal to have her as his, about how he would protect her, and how much power he had, yet he couldn&#39;t even protect her from this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she would be susceefully hurt right in his castle after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope that lady he was dancing with was really worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she felt the vampire tongue slithered over her neck, she shut her eyes, overwhelmed with disgust and struggling once again with the grip, Silas&#39;s hand shut up and held her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay put, the fu----&#34; his voice cut short immediately, his grip on her stiffened before it became lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi peeled hey eyes open, watching the man in front of her have all his veins popped out before he fell to the floor in agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The groan she heard all around was that of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thud was sudden and of multiple bodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she watched them curl unnaturally and reach for the ground before them, with their claws, fighting as their black eyeballs rolled into hiding, leaving white in it&#39;s wake, she knew she had seen that before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze shot up to the only one she knew could be responsible for this kind of thing and there he was, the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Black zig zag lines lined up his face, the frown etched into his features was unmistakable, the glare obvious. He was mad, big mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you touch what is mine?!&#34; His voice cut through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi moved quickly to her feet, not wanting to look any weaker than she already did before the numerous eyes that had now become an audience to this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you?!&#34; Blood slipped on the floor and she felt the stickness beneath her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes grew increasingly dark and Zezi felt a sort of rage seep into her. It was overpowering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness that left a bitter taste in her mouth, and an urge to kill that took over her heart completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again, feelings that weren&#39;t hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His blood had long ago faded from her system, why could she suddenly feel his feelings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around her, they groaned in pain, gritting their teeth, their pleas barely making it past their lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s eyes widened. Valerick always was one to be able to control himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he still in control?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi wanted to believe so but when her eyes caught Lady Delice constrained gasp as she reached for her heart, she knew he wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop this.&#34; She covered the distance in-between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked down at her, wild and out for blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands tingled to touch him and being closer to him felt this felt like home to her, yet her struggle against the bond remained, even when she wasn&#39;t deliberating doing it. It was just something born out of habit now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next scream she heard was that of a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand grabbed his wrist,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valerick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone in the crowd fell to his knees, blood spilling from his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get a hold of yourself!&#34; She half yelled, but the cries of agony around her only increased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valerick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as she hated vampires, Zezi found the sight horrific.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;D-do s--om---ething!&#34; Laura yelled. &#34;Stop him!&#34; She gritted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please!&#34; Lady Delice begged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s shoulder felt heavier, as she felt the pressure being thrown on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was seizing their souls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please.&#34; Another cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to die.&#34; That was a child&#39;s cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi looked around hurriedly, her heart thundering, as the vampire in front of her was more of the zig zag black lines that took over him, than person she knew, his eyes looking straight at those who his anger dwelled upon, like he couldn&#39;t notice that his rage was affecting others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yelled to him to stop, shook his arm but it had no result.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How else was she supposed to stop him?! How---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, at a thought that flashed in her mind, and throwing caution to the wind, she pressed her lips against him.</p>
