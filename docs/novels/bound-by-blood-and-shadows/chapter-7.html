                <p>&#34;He stopped Alice when she was about to leave the pack and seized your daughter.&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;Like I said, it isn&#39;t the pack against you anymore. He has sent the rest of his kind back to his Empire. He is giving us a day to give Zezi to him. If we don&#39;t, he will kill Mira and every single one of us.&#34;</p>

                <p>Fear wasn&#39;t always something he entertained but even his wolf that was full of ego and pride about his abilities knew when there was a challenge that they couldn&#39;t take down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wolf was shouting at him for being stupid. Zezi wasn&#39;t even his mate. Why must he risk his life like this for her? He was shouting back in his mind that she was his, just like he was hers and being true mates didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to Zezi, there were many things that he and his wolf never agreed on. Like what she truly meant to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Gery&#39;s voice snapped him out of his internal battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you covered up your scent and Zezi&#39;s and we would never find or we might but it would be too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a moment of silence, like the next words would never come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever plan you have to leave, George, I am begging to stop. There are a lot of lives on the line. For the sake of your daughter, make the right decision. Talk to Zezi, tell her everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t take it anymore, the pressure on him. He started closing down the link and the Alpha sensed it. He started shouting through the link, saying everything he had to say quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t hide this from her, Beta George. If he finds her, and I know he will, he will kill you. He will kill us all. He...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The link snapped shut and he sucked in a deep breath at being back into his environment. His legs felt weak and he staggered but there was someone by his side to steady him. He turned around and there was Zezi. Without saying a word, he pulled her into an embrace and he wept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to lose you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t say anything. She didn&#39;t know what to say but she patted his back gently making him know that whatever it was, she wasn&#39;t going anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was over, they were sitting by the fire again but it was cold this time and the fire was little. Smoke taking its place slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did Alpha Gery say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has Mira.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t need to be spelt out, they both knew who the He was. Zezi&#39;s hand rushed up to her chest immediately. It felt like she had been stabbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if he does something to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next words he said held no comfort or reassurance. He told her everything not leaving a single word out. When he was done, tears had dried up on her face. She stood up abruptly, went into the tent and got her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled painfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still have to ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to do this. We can come up with an idea. I can get Mira and Aunt Alice out, I know I can.&#34; His eyes were begging, desperately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; She tossed her bag to the floor, feeling weak from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will come up with a plan, I always do, my love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held her head in her palms, it suddenly felt so heavy. When she looked up at him, tears were rolling down her cheeks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, George...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was just so much determination in his eyes that made her crumble from within. One that she knew all too well, one that she had for long admired and loved but not now. Now, it would only bring them to their doom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even she knew when to give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will be together, all of us, I promise you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally spoke again, her voice was choked with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At what cost?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None!&#34; It was obvious that even at that point he didn&#39;t believe himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t lie to me. We both know that a lot of people will die. That is selfish, George. For me, packs will be vanquished, everything will be destroyed just because I want to stay with my family. He won&#39;t even let that happen. You know how they are, we both know. He said he would kill Mira and he will do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it, George. Just stop!&#34; She finally snapped, her chest raising and falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop thinking I can avoid this, that we can avoid this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hint of anger and desperation crossed his face then. He held onto her hands, vibrating from weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you suggest I do then?! Let you just go to the monster. We both know how they are and that is why I don&#39;t want you to have to face that. I love you and if I am even going to lose you at the end, I won&#39;t let it all go down without fighting for you. What kind of husband will I be if I don&#39;t fight for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you&#39;ve already done that. You&#39;ve fought and you&#39;ve fought hard. We&#39;ve both fought.&#34; She chuckled caressing his face tenderly. He smiled too, tears running down his face while he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now it is time to stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my love.&#34; He pulled her into an embrace, his heart aching badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For everyone, the pack, Mira, Aunt Alice, you. Let me go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arms tightened around her while he wept into her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want you to die because of me. I don&#39;t want our daughter dying because of me. I don&#39;t want anyone dying because of me. He is a monster and he won&#39;t stop till he gets what he wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know...I know...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let this happen.&#34; She pulled out of his embrace and looked at his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about this, I promise to come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t raise my hopes. We both know that is a promise you can&#39;t keep. Once you leave, you are never coming back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will, even if it kills me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Zezi and George stepped into the pack, they knew there was no going back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was just this silence that felt suffocating, like everyone was waiting for a certain doom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe they had thought that she wouldn&#39;t come back and they had tried to hide away in their houses waiting for their death. The air felt a bit heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They took another step and immediately guards surrounded them. George explained that they were here to surrender and quickly they were taken to the Alpha&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alpha and the Luna were more than happy to see them. Alpha Gery kept talking about how much this sacrifice means to the whole pack, never had George heard him apologise so much in his life. The Luna was just as sympathetic and she kept affirming that their sacrifice would never be forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to see my daughter and Aunt Alice.&#34; Zezi said, not in the mood to accept praises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alice is in her house.&#34; Luna Sky answered with a smile that didn&#39;t feel so reassuring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about my daughter?&#34; Zezi pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When no one spoke immediately, her heart raced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had that monster done to her daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is with him. He won&#39;t let her go till he has you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she...&#34; alive? She wanted to ask but she couldn&#39;t bring herself to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George clenched and unclenched his fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not having that crap! You better pray that she is alive and well because...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office door flung open at that moment and everyone turned to see who it was. There the King was, his hands folded behind him. His eyes roamed the room and stopped when they laid on Zezi. She was looking back at him too but she pulled herself out of that spell quickly. Fear was in her eyes as her mind took note of one important thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She speed towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is she? Where is my daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened instead and he didn&#39;t say a word but his black eyes studied her, taking every inch of her face and burning it into his memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slammed her hands against him to push him away but that had been her mistake. A sort of heat radiated beneath that fabric he wore and engulfed her skin. She felt it all again, like that day in the hall. The fire crossing quickly through her veins. She staggered back and looked up at him. She could have sworn that something flashed in those black eyes but she wasn&#39;t quite sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away from him quickly. Someone was putting down her daughter. Happiness exploded in her heart and before her daughter ran towards her, she was already there on her knees, her arms wrapped firmly around Mira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I lost you right there. I would have never forgiven myself.&#34; She whispered to her daughter, tears running down her face. She felt George pulled them both into an embrace like they always did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time around though, their blissful moment didn&#39;t last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take your hands off her.&#34;</p>
