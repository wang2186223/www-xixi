                <p>Luck seemed to be on Zezi&#39;s side because the King was just about to shut the door when she had appeared at the end of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty.&#34; She called out, despite not screaming her lungs out she knew that he had heard her and the way his back stiffened and the door stilled midway, showed that he indeed had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped in her tracks, when she was only a few steps away from him, her heart racing once again from the smell of the rain that flooded into her nostrils, a sharp twist of grimace shifted into her features as the smell of death that she had caught up on earlier disturbed her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t his, although it was coming from his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of creature possessed this kind of foul stench?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he been in a fight with the creature? Had he been attacked, perhaps?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart twisted at the thought and she tried to assess him as much as possible from his turned back to see if he was alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What. Do. You. Want?&#34; He turned slightly to her, offering her something that was barely a side glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She giggled nervously, rubbing her hands together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something felt strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something had always felt strange in-between them because of the situation they had been put in by fate and her unacceptance of the whole thing but this strange feeling was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t particularly like this one. Not like she had ever liked any strange feeling that came with him--- wait, what was she doing?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want plenty things but first, let&#39;s start with a key. I can&#39;t explain how I have suddenly lost my keys, but I need you to give me the spare one with you. I know you have it, so can you just hand it over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stretched out her hand to him, moving her fingers impatiently as she waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight, Zezi.&#34;</p>

                <p>Did he just leave her here, like this, without giving her the keys that she had requesting for?</p>

                <p>Did he just slam the door in her face?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the empty space in front of her confirmed otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had in fact slammed the door in her face and completely ignored her request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was wrong with him tonight?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taken aback, Zezi went back to her room and she slid to the side of the door, hugging her kneels while she wondered if attempting to break the door down would be wise, just after she had tried and failed to pick the lock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These doors were made differently, she would just have to study them so that if something like this should repeat itself, she wouldn&#39;t have to go that grumpy vampire for help. Besides, there shouldn&#39;t be a lock that she wouldn&#39;t be able to pick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be a stain to her War General&#39;s clean record.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Zezi, you seem to be having a problem with your lock. Mind passing the night in my room instead?&#34; Lady Delice was in front of her, offering her a way out with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, Zezi found herself smiling too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she always there in moments like this? It almost felt like a blessing, one she couldn&#39;t keep denying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little piece of shit!&#34; Lady Laura appeared from the stairway and made her way to them, but Oliver blocked her path, trying to calm her down with his goofiness. It was a difficult thing not to laugh at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will pay for the wedge you have driven between my brother and I, you stupid fur bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laura.&#34; Lady Delice said silently, rushing over to her side. &#34;I thought you said you came here to apologize. We talked about this, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologize? Never.&#34; She gritted through her lips before turning away. &#34;Coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go ahead, I have something to discuss with Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then give me the key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you need my keys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sleeping in your room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because your friend is sad and you need to take care of her as her little mummy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I have to sleep by my Mate&#39;s side tonight.&#34; Oliver chipped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what? Two of them planned to share Lady Delice&#39;s room with her? Despite knowing the two of them knowing of Oliver&#39;s past with Lady Delice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had shame become non-existent? Simple reasoning too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of friendship was this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or were you planning to offer the Fur crea--her our space.&#34; She said with grimace, her eyes screaming the question &#34;Are you going to pick her over me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered how many manipulative tactic this spiteful creature had up sleeves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have the keys.&#34; Lady Delice finally broke the silence. &#34;Go ahead. I will be there soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left but before they disappeared, Zezi caught a glimpse of Oliver sending a wink to Delice, one that even the ever polite Delice had responded to with a grimace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, a threesome, I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This joke at my expense is cruel.&#34; Lady Delice replied but a smile danced at the corners of her lips as she turned her attention to Zezi. &#34;I am sorry that I can no longer offer my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is fine. I understand. Shall we go and chase then our for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice giggled. &#34;I will just let them have it tonight. I will sleep in the library.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Friends shouldn&#39;t inconvenience each other unnessarily like that. You know that, right, Lady Delice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged, smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our friendship is different. We are not like others.&#34; Before Zezi would have an opportunity to say more, Lady Delice bowed lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight, Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a couple of steps upstairs, to the library, then stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or you may join me, if you want. I will really appreciate your company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sounded nice, lovely in fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded like a chance to get jolly with the enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi mustn&#39;t forget herself. No matter how hard the line she drew was trying to erase itself, she must keep drawing it over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice might be nice to her but she still was a vampire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Werewolves and vampires weren&#39;t friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I will be just fine here. Thank you and goodnight, Lady Delice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The floor was hard, and soon enough, her door didn&#39;t feel so comfortable to rest on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard not to think of home when one was alone. The thoughts of the pack and the wellbeing of her family members crossed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She missed her daughter the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sweet Mira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped she was doing alright and not getting sick as she used to. She hoped that she was having more friends and her absense wasn&#39;t weighing down her spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped that her daughter was happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in her eyes as she remembered the nightmare her daughter had the night the Alpha had sent George to give her the pass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she hadn&#39;t attached much importance to it back then, she had tried as much as possible to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate, sometimes, was just inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped George wasn&#39;t cooked up in his room with depression, she hoped he was doing his duty, she even hoped that he had already found a mate.  It would be better for him if the had, better for him and Mira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there was Aunt Alice, she--</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clicking of something snapped her out of her thoughts and she was shocked to find the King by the door. She staggered to her feet, feeling stupid to have been so lost in her thoughts to the point that she had been rendered vulnerable for that short moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You Majesty. What are yo---?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said you needed my spare key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice was so cold, it felt like ice against her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked slightly as she pushed it open and stepped in. She expected him to leave afterwards but he didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead he slipped into the room, right after her, shutting the door firmly behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, what?</p>
