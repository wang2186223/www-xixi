                <p>&#34;If we were to kill you, Lady Zezi and that is if,&#34; Delice said calmly, emphasizing the massive impossibility of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the mark of the King that she now carried, it would be easier for him to sense if she was in any kind of danger way faster than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think your death would kill the King or make him sink into eternal depression? His Majesty would be out for blood. His grief will not be a quiet one.&#34; Her voice trembled and the look in her eyes showed that she remembered something that she didn&#39;t want to. Maybe it had to do with the war during the Dark Times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick had fought his father to end it, they must have seen him at his most feral state during the battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the way her face looked extra pale and the way she gulped down the rest of the blood in the goblet, Zezi was sure that would be something she didn&#39;t want to experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, you might not know this but I do not want to lose my friend. I will have no one to visit my son&#39;s grave with if you are gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi let out a dry chuckle. If the poison worked on the King as they planned, she would be gone anyways. So, what was she saying?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean not so soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Lady Delice just stop growing on her already?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can always go with the Princess.&#34; She said with a wink and Delice cringed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Blood, please, no&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Get out of that toxic friendship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to say but she knew Lady Delice would say their friendship was a special one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back to the idea of killing the King, Zezi didn&#39;t find herself as committed to the course as she used to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, she no longer hated him to the point that she would lay down her life just to ensure that he would cease to exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was another thing, she no longer wanted to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are sure that poisoning him will kill him?&#34; She asked absentmindedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So many things had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was getting harder and harder to reach a decision and commit to it. Valerick stayed at the back of her mind like a thought she could never get rid of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was starting to feel like she wasn&#39;t trying hard enough to, truthfully, she really didn&#39;t want to get rid of him just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It should.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi looked around the simple room and back to Lady Delice who looked back at her with a glimmer of doubt in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gulped, walking away to drop the goblet on the dressing table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t really assuring to see her like this, she was usually calm and collected... and sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But right now, she wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We didn&#39;t really have anyone like him to test it on but---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So... they were not sure?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How fantastic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi chuckled, although there were so many things that she was thinking about at that moment, many things that she didn&#39;t find funny at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to speak but a knock came at the door and they froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s heart skipped a beat as she took in a deep breath, trying to figure out if Valerick was the one behind that door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The walls of this castle were soundproof, just like the doors but if Valerick had been the one standing behind that door, things would be different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t him though and she let out a sigh of relief. Although she would have sensed it if it was him, but she was afraid that she was too wrapped up in the conversation to have observed that, besides, she was still finding it hard to adjust to this fated mate thing and the &#34;perks&#34; that came with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice attended to the guard at the door, they spoke shortly and she was back once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her aura was filled with calmness, an overwhelming one, she was trying to hide something, Zezi could just sense it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which she wouldn&#39;t have been able to do before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all reminded her of that time Valerick had fed her his blood to heal her. If the bond worked as well as the blood did, then the impossibility of killing her to get to him just doubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that moment, she felt untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything alright?&#34; Zezi asked her and Lady Delice appeared startled by her voice before she smiled calmly at her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His Majesty called for a meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was normal, she was after all his Royal Adviser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right now?&#34; She knew she wasn&#39;t invited, she wanted to believe that she wasn&#39;t mad at that but something curled painfully in her stomach and her wolf&#39;s anger weighed heavily in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since that mark, her wolf had been more active than passive, different from the way she used to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In about twenty minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then.&#34; She clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth. &#34;I have to see him before then.&#34; She said as she headed to the door but Lady Delice&#39;s voice stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did she just say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What for?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WHAT FOR?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A growl tumbled in her chest and she turned back to look at her, blue flashing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will see my mate any damn time I like and I don&#39;t have to report to you.&#34; She snapped, her grip hard on the doorknob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Lady Zezi. I didn&#39;t mean to put it like that.&#34; She apologized, her eye filled with understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi blinked, furrowing her brows at her outburst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wolf was restless and everything was getting on her bad side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Till the mating process was complete, she would be very cranky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to snap. If you are free today, we can visit your son together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice&#39;s eyes brightened up and she nodded enthusiastically. &#34;It&#39;s a date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she just say a date?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An involuntary chuckle pass through Zezi&#39;s lips, this time she did not try to think too much about her relationship with Lady Delice and what effect it might have on her plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, there was a possibility that she might genuinely like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are weird, Royal Adviser. Really weird.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They laughed, as Zezi slipped out of the door and shut the door behind her.</p>
