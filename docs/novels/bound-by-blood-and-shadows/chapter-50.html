                <p>&#34;George is a born Alpha. As little as he was, he was ready to protect me, protect any survivor and that was me.&#34; She popped another piece of meat into her mouth, not really tasting or savouring it, just eating because she felt a need to keep her mouth busy asides from how she was already using her words to rip his heart apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said he would be beside me all the way and he was. He protected me. We were destined to be together right from the beginning and we didn&#39;t even know back then.&#34; She said, watching him as he stared back at her icily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, she was getting the reaction she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dagger she had dug into his heart had not hurt him, she knew, but this should be doing something, showing him one-quarter of the pain she was going through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;George is a wonderful father and the only husband that I would ever have.&#34; She paused, taking in a breath. &#34;When he thought that I would never have a mate, because of what the witch said, he was willing to be mine and for me to be his, without question. What we have, no one ever will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am your mate, Zezi.&#34; He said tightly, no matter how calm he wanted to seem, she was really pushing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body betrayed her, tingles across her skin, crossing through her veins at his mention of her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished he would stop calling her with so much intensity and familiarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you are not my husband, your Majesty.&#34; She started cutting her meat slowly and tenderly again, just as slowly as the words coming out of her mouth were burning into his heart. &#34;Fate might have chosen you but I will never choose you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scalding. Hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;&#39;Be kind,&#39; he played Gwen&#39;s words in his head again, trying to put himself in her shoes to stay considerate but consideration was a foreign feeling, and it couldn&#39;t be learned in one day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was harder than he had predicted it to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have accepted it though.&#34; She flashed him a smile. &#34;At first, I really wanted to die but I know I cannot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained cold, his face placid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had tried?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that it? That day he was feeling weird. Was that because she was trying to take her own life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t let me go matter the point of time I try to do it, and since I can&#39;t die, I have accepted to languish like this as a sacrifice for the rest of my very long pathetic life, that you&#39;ll be granting to me on a platter of gold. My most gracious appreciation, your Majesty. There is no way possible for me to express my full gratitude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he had admitted to himself before, being considerate wasn&#39;t his thing and it was hard to learn it in just one day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The speed was far too quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right in front of her, his hand on her shoulder, slamming her into the chair, the force making the chair screech and push back toward the edge of the podium they were on and towards the water design around it. Just a little more push and she would fall over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you done?!&#34; His voice came out in a growl, his eyes going darker by the moment but her anger was still very present, making her fear of him little to compare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moved by nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the butterflies that treasonously fluttered in her stomach by his closeness, nor by the danger that she was dangling by the edge of the podium, nor the dark eyes like an abyss that seemed to look straight into her soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt no real pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only something like a smoky touch. A vapour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Done?&#34; She snapped right back. &#34;Never, I&#39;m not done, your Majesty, and in fact, I don&#39;t think--- I&#39;ll ever---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand clapped on that mark on her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ahh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should have moved away from him right from the moment he got closer, his presence was always spooking her pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gritted her teeth in pain, pressing her lips together, her breathing laboured as she shut her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zezi? Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gulped, trying to wait it out, but a whimper slipped out through her lips, unintentionally answering his questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a feathery cold touch on her neck, right against her mark, and as much as she wanted to move away, her body relaxed under the relief the touch gave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fading away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard him say, and her eyes snapped open immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sprung up to her feet, the chair empty in seconds, as she headed to the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to get out of here, but he was right in front of her before she could do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dinner is not over yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want any more of this excuse of a meeting. Dining with the enemy is not my thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zezi, I&#39;m not my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to reach for her hand but she snatched them away immediately, the fear in her eyes visible for a slight moment before it was covered once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned, in realization, taking a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are afraid of me.&#34; He said slowly. But how? She had been so brave with attacking him and standing up to him. He had thought she wasn&#39;t, he had been glad she wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you so afraid of me? I am your mate, why do you treat me like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of the things you have down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not my Father!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you are just as wicked! You separated me from my family. You could have left me happy and married your Delice but no.&#34; She ended, venom in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are mates; our destinies are bonded, and neither of us will truly thrive without the other. We need each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t touch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He folded his hands behind him before he would instinctively reach her for her again and get rejected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why won&#39;t you just give me a chance? I am trying, meet me halfway.&#34; He was running out of ideas. The Book did not provide for a situation like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you keep treating me like this, Zezi?&#34; He moved again and she staggered back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of who you are and what you stand for.&#34; Even a step below her, she still had to look up at him. &#34;Tell me, your Majesty, if you were in my shoes, would you not be afraid of you? Would you not treat you just the same?&#34;</p>
