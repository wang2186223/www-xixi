                <p>To say what she had said in anger meant that her words had certainly held it them, truth, to a certain degree that made her afraid. Now, it was confirmed that she had feelings for him.</p>

                <p>For the creature that had almost brought her kind to it&#39;s end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the King that held her people captive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the one that had separated her from her family, and turtored her daughter and husband in his cold dungeon, when she had not readily flung herself into his arms at his claim of the existence of a matebond between him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that vampire, feelings for him existed in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that within five months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she really that weak?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi blinked, biting her lower lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even in her dreams would that be possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stay mad at your mate for so long. Let him take care of your cuts.&#34; He said with an edge of excitement in his voice as he referred to himself in third person so he could linked together in his words once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Must he turtore her with that reminder?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she had spoken out without thinking earlier, for a second there, everything had seem to go still and her overwhelming feeling had stopped raging within her, but now that she now knew and acknowledged why she was acting the way she had been acting towards him recently, the overwhelming feelings had doubled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed time to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain in her clenched fists shot into her brain and she could feel herself weakening with silver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will take care of it myself. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you still mad at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; She answered, standing up, praying that this tears that was building in her, would not glimmer in her eyes. &#34;I want to but I can&#39;t be. Not anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is a good thing, right?&#34; He asked, looking at her like he was trying to read, even the smallest things she wasn&#39;t communicating to him about right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least, for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t a good thing for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please when I try to leave this time.&#34; Her gaze moved slowly to the door then back at him. &#34;Do not stop me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said you are not mad at me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was confusing him, she knew that, but she felt confused herself and she just needed to be alone right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her by the wrist the closer she got to the door, stopping her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not very good with this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His frown deepened, a slow smile taking over his face, not because he found any of this amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have now guidance for this. I haven&#39;t read that part yet... I think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Part of what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My Guide on &#39;How to be a Perfect Mate&#39; Volume 4.&#34; He met her eyes that went slightly wide with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are reading books on this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,&#34; he shrugged. &#34;I don&#39;t know how to do this and I need to figure out somehow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, feeling her throat tightened with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really not want me to stop you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you are sure you are not mad at me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away, planting her gaze on the door instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so close, yet so far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a way I can help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, moving her wrist to remimd him that he was still holding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, he let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come to me when you are ready.&#34; He pressed down the doorknob, moving to a side. &#34;I will be waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was scared though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time she seem to be communicating with him, really communicating with him. He was scared that she might never be coming back to him, and even if she did, he was terrified that she would come back as a different person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he must let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She mumbled a goodnight and with her werewolf speed she was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to get away from him that fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming to terms with being his mate must be a really hard thing to adjust to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood but it still hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was determined not to cry no matter how overwhelmed she felt. Shutting the door behind her, she raced to her dressing table and started arranging it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bottles at the back, frame to the left, or should the frames be to the right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe back to the left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt that if she kept her mind occupied with thoughts she might happen to figure this situation she had found herself caught up in along the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she knew she had feelings for him, what next?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were many questions, and answers for these questions, she greatly lacked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bottles to the left. Frames to the right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright, Milady?&#34; Someone said from the door as she rushed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Silas is a stupi---&#34; she paused, her frown having an underlay of sme halfway through her sentence. &#34;Was. I&#39;m so glad. I never liked him anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without asking, she took Zezi&#39;s hand and made her sit on the dressing chair while she started taking care of her cuts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He thinks he is close to the King and he would let him get away for anything just because he had been an immerse help in fighting the former King at the end of the Dark Times. Foolish man. They&#39;ll rot in their shabby graves.&#34; She snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was surprising that her Mistress wasn&#39;t already hissing in pain. The cuts looked quick deep and been attacked with silver was painful for werewolves, but when she looked up at her Mistress, tears were already streaming down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Foolish Right Province Governor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never cried during her treatment before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen wished she could kill him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know it would hurt so much. I will be gentler.&#34; Gwen said, rushing up the treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was done, her Mistress was even in a worse condition, hiccuping from the tears and Gwen had pulled her to her chest in consolation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder the King had sent me. You are in so much pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she just say the King?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More tears because why was this happening to her?</p>
