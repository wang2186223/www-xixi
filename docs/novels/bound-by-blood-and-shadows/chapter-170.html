                <p>Something in Delice dropped and her shoulders slumped, as she took some steps closer to her broken friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Laura I would never--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anger in her eyes didn&#39;t subsidize. &#34;Or you are still in love with him after all these years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I am not guilty of such.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why are you seeing his ghost and I am not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura was crying now, her body trembling slightly, even her luxurious dress couldn&#39;t hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has been hard for me and just because I put on a bold front you don&#39;t know how hard it is. You don&#39;t know what I have been going through. There is already so much problem with the extract that I had been stolen from me and then this---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The extract,&#34; Delice interjected as if she was hearing the word for the first time. &#34;Do you mean the Volakys extract?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would make sense, since she had said Riza and Basit had paved the way for the new solution, except there was something she didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But, what?! The Volakys?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura gasped. &#34;No! I would never involve us with those vile creatures. Do you know how much we had to struggle to gain freedom from them? Their reigns?! I would never take us back to the Dark Times. What kind of Evil do you think I am? Do you not know me?&#34; Laura leaned against the wall, as if she had lost strength and faith in her legs to hold her up, tears swindled in her eyes and the sour bitter feeling of guilt spread through Delice&#39;s veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, we are talking about my Oli. You saw him? Heard his voice? What does that imply about you, Delice? Having illusions about my mate? Mine and not yours. My. Dead. Mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice shook her head, already consumed with regret. &#34;I saw nothing. I heard nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; She hissed. &#34;You don&#39;t have to lie to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laura, shhhh,&#34; Delice finally closed the gap between them, and pulled her into an embrace. Laura&#39;s weakness and total reliance on her, made Delice feel like she was carrying more than she could bear. For anyone looking, it would look like a simple embrace but in reality, it felt heavier than any embrace should be. &#34;I am sorry, I am so sorry for everything. I shouldn&#39;t have suggested that extract was from the Volaky, I knew how hurt you were when your brother did that. I should have done better. I am sorry for bringing you back into this state. I am so sorry about Oliver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never blamed you for not being there to help me with my grief.&#34; Laura wept into Delice&#39;s shoulder. &#34;I am struggling and trying to do it all by myself because I know we all have things to confront, especially with everything happening in the Castle. How could you hurt me like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heavy words that pierced through the heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry. Forgive me. It will not happen again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Delice. I could never not forgive you. The grief is just too much for me, I don&#39;t know what to do with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some minutes of crying and consolation, Laura pulled away from the embrace, and wiped her tears. Just like that, her pitiful look was gone like it was never there. A smile played on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are drunk,&#34; she laughed. &#34;I can smell it in your breath. That is why you are seeing things.&#34; She laughed harder and Delice joined in the laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it died and seriousness seeped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will find out whosoever did this and I will make them pay. The thief will not go unpunished.&#34; Then she moved closer. &#34;I love you, Delice, promise me that no matter what happens you will never leave my side. You are the only one and without me by your side, there is nothing for either of us.&#34; Something switched in her look and Delice stiffened, knowing they were back to the roleplaying. Something about this didn&#39;t feel right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you love me, Mummy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Laura.&#34; She reached for her and cupped her face, giving her a reassuring smile, one Laura later returned. &#34;My brave, strong, Laura.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem was waiting by the door when his Sire stepped out of the room he had only known existed because he had seen her step in. His gaze clashed with the Princess&#39;s, her red eyes were burning with fury and he looked away immediately, fearing that if she looked at him for a second longer, it would click and she would realize that he was the thief she was searching for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was stealing the extract, he had been so distracted by the thoughts of his Sire and that Wolf being together that he had forgotten to put in a replica.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must not find out that he was the thief, even his High Pillar mustn&#39;t know about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of joining the meeting though, his High Pillar turned to the exit and so, he followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice had gone straight to her room and stepped outside with digging tools.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem was more than confused. The hallway was dark and empty, which was good since no one would be able to be a witness to his Sire losing her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to see your Medallion, Milady?&#34; He asked skeptically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Akeem.&#34; She stopped short, her gaze blank and her shoulders stiff. The memory of seeing and hearing Oliver&#39;s voice was still playing in her mind. It felt too real to be a mere illusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t that drunk. In fact, she wasn&#39;t drunk at all. Her senses felt sharpened than they had ever felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Sire?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you dig out Oliver&#39;s coffin for me, I want to see what is in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem obliged, taking the tools from her without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you wish, Sire.&#34;</p>
