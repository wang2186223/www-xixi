                <p>Her hand stilled around the fork and she looked at Gwen, while her brain went through different excuses like a quick unnaturally running clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If none of them were to work, as Gwen was smart, then she would just have to get rid of her. Might even make the King get rid of her himself.</p>

                <p>Too clear, in fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I get rid of them?&#34; Gwen&#39;s voice came to her like she was speaking from a distance. It was hard for her to make out what her help was saying over all the scheming that was going on in her head. &#34;They are all empty.&#34;</p>

                <p>Hmmm, empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sounded like a word she should know the meanin--- oh, did she just say empty?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi blinked, focusing on the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were very much not empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were clear and big, even someone without super sight could see that something was definitely on those papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen&#39;s eyes brightened with an idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! You are using them for your frames. Can I have one, please can I have one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s frown deepened and she turned to her food, taking one forkful and shoving it into her mouth to calm herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she really not see the writing on the paper? Or was she pretending? Gwen was a smart woman, no matter how teenager like she might seem sometimes, she was a mother and a vampire before anything, her primal instincts would be guiding her most times, plus being a mother was no easy task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if she had read what was on the paper, turned it to her to confirm that she had the knowledge, then now was playing pretend to get out of the situation so she could get to the King before her. What if she was thinking ahead of the plan that Zezi had in mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shouldn&#39;t have gone stiff when she was confronted with the paper, she should have played it in off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was trapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll draw my kids like that frame.&#34; She sat down, her aura pouring out a giddiness that was almost too hard to contain. She must have used her speed to make it to the seat because Zezi hadn&#39;t taken note of her move. It felt wierd for Gwen to be using her abilities, she didn&#39;t always do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made Zezi feel on edge and she struggled to suppress it, while she drank the cup of water in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost as soon as she sat down, Gwen jumped to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I shouldn&#39;t have done that.&#34; She said with a giddy smile, placing the paper on the table, while she looked down at her Mistress. &#34;I should have asked before I did that. But can I sit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi took her in for a moment, if she knew anything, she would certainly tell the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how much she claimed that her loyalty remained to her, it was in the light of seeing her as future Queen and if she saw that they didn&#39;t have the same goal, with her actively trying to destroy that, well, things might change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi had to ensure that they wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might even have to get her hands dirty in the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good thing, she had never minded dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, one that didn&#39;t reach the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, you can sit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen sat down, and her smile dwindled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your were thinking of your family again. I shouldn&#39;t have said anything about the frame. I&#39;m so sorry.&#34; She was standing up again but words rushed out of Zezi&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. It&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard your heart race when I showed you the paper and when I realize it was for the frames, I was too happy to stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi extended her hand to Gwen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mind me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I do, Milady. Your happiness is mine. Your sadness is mine and when I am the one that reminds you of your sadnesse, then my sadness tripples.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was very convincing, but.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi could still feel a but.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this was real, she shouldn&#39;t feel a &#34;but&#34; at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad you are warming up to us though.&#34; She bit her lips, like a child that had just said something she wasn&#39;t supposed to. &#34;I know it is selfish, but your presence brings us so much happiness. We will treat you well, we promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We?&#34; Zezi folded her arms across her teasingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is group of supporters for you and the King, we are rooting for you Milady.&#34; Gwen nodded slowly, and the glint in her ears said she wouldn&#39;t say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me guess, and the leader of this group is, Gwen, my Lady maid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One and only. And my entire family is part of the movement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite herself, Zezi found herself laughing. Her face flickered to the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, sit. Tell me what you are going to draw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen smiled, sitting down quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll draw my whole family. They are going to laugh when I show them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s heart dropped at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made her heart ache at how fast she had thought of killing someone, without thinking of how important that person was to other people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always thought of killing people quickly on the battle without all that, but this wasn&#39;t a battlefield unless Gwen makes it into one. So far, she wasn&#39;t sure of anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will they like it if &#39;we&#39; drew them one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen sat back, looking straight at her, before her eyes went misty with tears and she nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Very much, Milady.&#34; Her reply was quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi bit her lips, looking down at her food which she had monetarily forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can draw one for your movement t--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chair scrapped against the floor and next, Gwen was laying down on the floor, crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gwen.&#34; Zezi stood up, startled by her actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen&#39;s hands wrapped around Zezi&#39;s feet as she wept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must have died and gone to heaven. My wishes are coming true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s doubt increased about her knowledge and her act of pretense. Could she really be doing this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m still not letting your King--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put strangers in you. I know, my Milady.&#34; Gwen looked up with a devilsihsb grin. &#34;There will be no strangers involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had possesesed her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to need more food, because the &#39;mighty&#39; artistic spirit in me is going to need all the strength it can get.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about--&#34; Gwen was quick to put a bowl of chicken noodle soup on the table, the vapour still dancing out from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as Zezi was curious as to how she had managed to keep it hot, she only scoffed and rolled her eyes at the implied option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not smooth, Gwen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, not today then. A day in the future certainly. I have all the time, the movement is also very patient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Gwen left, Zezi stood up, keeping the letters somewhere else and bringing out new papers instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really hoped she wouldn&#39;t have to get rid of Gwen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sweet, and it would hurt her so much if she had to erase her from the story.</p>
