                <p>Whatever she had expected as the consequences of her refusal, wasn&#39;t what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was surprising but that had been it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing that she had practically given the totality of herself away in the bloodoath, which, regarding what Gwen had said, had only worked because she really wanted at heart to save her family, also being caught in between knowing that his blood in her would really keep her from harming herself for an undisclosed amount of time and the thought that killing herself would bring more harm than good, Zezi was left with no only option than to wait her dilemma out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still had the silver dagger with her though, although her purpose for it had now changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She planned to quickly exhaust the blood&#39;s power in her veins, by always marking herself with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day it stings and heals very slowly, she would know that had finally gotten rid of the vile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really hoped that would happen sooner than she thought it would. The amount of despair and rage she was feeling was overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hopefully, along the line, the King would get tired of her and let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a ridiculous thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t going to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was another option that seemed more possible though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some time ago, she had read somewhere that as long as the vampires hadn&#39;t marked their mate, their life span was still the same as it normally would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So probably, she would grow old and die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet again, that was very unlikely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mark on her neck was fading away and soon she would be without it. Which meant that she might succumb to the need for her &#39;mate&#39; and would seek for him herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers skimmed over the stick figures she was drawing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Mira, George, and Aunt Alice. For someone with a wide imagination, she had no artistic skills. If only she could just download the images in her mind, right down on paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How lovely that would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Purposely, she had ensured not to include herself in her masterpiece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentle knock on the door seeped into her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen was here once again to give her dinner. She was always punctual, also, Zezi didn&#39;t bother to put up the attitude of not eating. The least of all the things she needed right now was for the King to know what was going on in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Gwen would be forced to tell him about what she had done recently if she seemed to be acting out of order. Smelling the King on her all the time was already enough torture; now, having him in her business would completely screw her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worst, he might decide that toying with his hold on her wasn&#39;t enough and finally mark her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a seventy percent chance of that happening already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, she was doomed to this life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The best she could do right now, was try to give herself time before the ultimate torment would crash down on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shot up to her neck, and she hissed in pain from the sizzling heat the mark on her neck gave her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady!&#34; Gwen busted in, not waiting to hear a &#34;come in.&#34; &#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi left her sketchbook on the bed, standing up and giving her a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Close the door behind you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did so hurriedly, but not before sniffing the air and giving her Mistress a quick one over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; She sat down at the dining chair, ready for their usual routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady, the dagger you used--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I threw it away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Gwen nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is the trolley?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fell on her knees quickly, her head bowed, her gaze fixed on the ground, and her hands curled into fists on her thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His Majesty wants you to join him for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi closed her eyes briefly, taking in a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was starting to get really annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already know my answer.&#34; She opened her eyes. &#34;No. If he asks again, don&#39;t even bother to ask me, just tell him no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was just so ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything he had done, he expected her to sit down at the same table with him, and eat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last dinner had gone *greatly*, she really wanted to *relive* the experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must know that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How very considerate of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady, please--&#34; Gwen&#39;s voice was quiet and a little broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi frowned, that didn&#39;t sound right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she realized something. The long sleeves of the long yellow gown that Gwen was wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went on her knees quickly, pulling the sleeves up before Gwen snapped her hand away with a jerk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi gritted her teeth, her eyes shining with annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I--I fell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow smile sneaked up her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, sorry. For someone stuck in a room, I understand how slippery the floor can get sometimes. Imagine you who has to walk around the castle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen squinted her eyes, that didn&#39;t sound very convincing and her Mistress&#39;s heartbeat wasn&#39;t giving away anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold that thought. I&#39;m suddenly in the mood for dinner with the King.&#34; She sprung up, twirling in front of her. &#34;How do I look?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;G-good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s smile widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was lying. It wasn&#39;t always so easy to tell whenever Gwen was lying before, but she was presently a nervous wreck; knowing her for a while was also helping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very good.&#34; She rose to her feet. &#34;Maybe I should style your hair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I need that. I look good. Besides, I have to run. I wouldn&#39;t want to keep His Majesty waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a change she hadn&#39;t expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly led her Mistress out of the room, who, unknown to her, had a dagger firmly tied to her inner thigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi smiled to herself, the closer she felt they were getting to the dining hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the dining hall&#39;s door swung open, her gaze landed right on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was at the far head of the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She breezed in, moving closer to him, her hand darting underneath her gown to get the dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she had it in her hand, she sent it flying across the dining hall, making it plant right into his chest, where his heart should be.</p>
