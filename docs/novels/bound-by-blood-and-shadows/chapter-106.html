                <p>&#34;My Lady.&#34; Gwen said as she tried to searched the wardrobe for the gown that was suitable for tonight ceremony on her Lady. Her Lady had seemed too occupied these days that she had not even made any preparations towards the ceremony at all, but lucky for her, she had a maid like Gwen, and a person with Gwen was a person with no problems, because she would take care of everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her right measurements, Gwen had gone to see the Royal Seamstress and stocked her Mistress&#39;s wardrobe with different dresses made in varieties of colors, except white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Official mates for tonight would be wearing that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know if the King is back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen fought a smile. Her mate was right. A couple of days ago, she had been so worried about her Mistress&#39;s absentminded behaviour and discussed the matter with her husband, who had easily suggested that their future Queen might have finally fallen in love with their King, and was just being worried about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claiming that her Mistress was most likely alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, it seemed that he was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. The King is not back.&#34; She moved the dresses, placing them in front of her Mistress, staring at her reflection in the mirror to see which one would fit her the most. &#34;This one, Milady?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is he not back yet?&#34; She walked away, making Gwen&#39;s hand hang up in the air, with the dress still in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What could be taking him so long? Shouldn&#39;t we send help to him? What if he his in danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah.&#34; This time around, Gwen couldn&#39;t fight the smile that took over her face.  &#34;Finally, my Lady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was startled by her excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The workings of Gwen&#39;s mind was always different from hers. What could she be possibly thinking about this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Blood, you are in love!&#34; She squealed, bursting with eagerness, her body swaying to a music only she could hear. &#34;You are completely in love with our King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Zezi didn&#39;t immediately say anything, she added for further clarification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our King, your mate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, thank you, Gwen. How could she ever had guessed that was the vampire she was referring to without that little explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So grateful for the clarification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be ridiculous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How else can you explain this? You haven&#39;t eaten since afternoon because you are so worried about him...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just not hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...and right now you can&#39;t even chose a dress because he is all you have on your mind...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The dress? None have caught my eyes so far--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your eyes, Milady, glimmered with worry just talking about him.&#34; She grabbed both sides of her cheeks and Zezi stared back at her dumbfounded as she stared deep into her way like she was reading something in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are absolutely in love. Those eyes cannot lie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonsense.&#34; She pulled her hands away, shrugging them off. &#34;I&#39;m not. Why would I be in love with a blood sucking monster?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of Gwen&#39;s smile to disappeared, it only broadened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even your hateful words no longer bear the hate in them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not on love with him.&#34; She gritted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. Whatever you say, Milday. Please, let us pick you a dress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi had ended up with a red glittering dress. It had way too many exposing parts, one right from her left midthigh straight down, her V neckline was a little too deep, it revealed the soft upper part of her bosom, but what she found most concerning was that her neck was left completely exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen must have had a lot of scandalous thoughts in her mind while choosing this dress for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that she had her hair packed into a messy bun with silver stones in it, made her feel even more vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There will be a lot of vampires there. Was it wise, to make herself this tempting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there another?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had tried to ask but it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice was already at the door and Gwen was ushering her out, claiming that she was already late for the ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her heels that, thankfully, weren&#39;t too high, she stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look stunning.&#34; She complimented Lady Delice when her gaze landed on her right after Gwen had shut the door firmly behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice had on a brown flowing A shape gown, with sliver designs around the neckline down to the waist and hem of the dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. I wish I could just wear one of my normal dresses but Laura would kill.m me if I let her look bad by being too simple. I will be the one taking the goblet down to them, I must look presentable, she said.&#34; Lady Delice had said with a small laugh but Zezi hadn&#39;t joined her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their friendship was something she would never pretend to find normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of things humans use, such as rings, they would drink from a bonding content from the Ceremony Silver Goblet, then make a vow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi had tried to keep herself inform properly of her enemies. The more she knew, the easier it would be to bring them down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the King back yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I wonder why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If the King isn&#39;t back yet, this might affect many things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, he will have to be the one to take Laura to the alter. The ceremony cannot commence without the King. All the guests are here and yet--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi heart was starting to race now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he not with the people that went to take care of the Den?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he disappeared.&#34; Lady Delice&#39;s words were starting to fade into a distant echo. &#34;We sent out a search party to look for him. In fact, I was hoping you would know his whereabouts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>SHE DIDN&#39;T!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would I know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you had marked each other---&#34; Lady Delice paused when she caught sight of Zezi&#39;s bare neck and Zezi&#39;s hand shot up to her neck, rubbing the spot a mark should be, pushing away this strange feeling of guilt that was sipping into her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, we thought he might be in your room.&#34; Delice ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In my room doing what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice gave her a side glance, blinking away her confusion. &#34;He is your mate, Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see. Well, he is not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have no fear, Lady Zezi.&#34; She was quick to offer her a smile. &#34;He might even be in the ballroom as we speak. Shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, she hoped he would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they got to the ballroom though, he wasn&#39;t there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was he?</p>
