                <p>They were only a few steps away from the cheering crowd, and Delice could see the podium distantly from here. Her face heated up at the sight of the King in his seat. Seeing him always made her feel that way, she loved him. But he had a mate and she had to stay away... for now, although Laura would argue otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze shifted to the other side of the podium, landing on the werewolf who had his pup in his arms, as he looked around with misery in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart went out to them, the one that was certainly not beating but still, it did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Blood, I forgot!&#34; Laura stopped suddenly in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My bracelet!&#34; She dangled her bare wrist up to Delice. &#34;The very one my Mother gave me. You know how important that is to me right? It&#39;s the last thing I have of her. I don&#39;t feel complete and I can&#39;t watch this execution if I don&#39;t feel complete.&#34; Laura&#39;s lips quickly stretched into a smile. &#34;It&#39;s on the table, next to the last bottle containing a green liquid. Don&#39;t touch the bottle, get the bracelet. I don&#39;t want to miss any of this and the seventh bang will be soon.&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll save you a seat.&#34; She pushed her forward lightly, turning her around to face the Castle gate. &#34;Now go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, she was gone. With her guards behind her. Not that she wasn&#39;t enough to take any danger she was to face, but Laura loved to flaunt that she had power over other people, even after having power of her own. Delice didn&#39;t think having guards around her was necessary most times; she just didn&#39;t like having too many people around her; she loved her space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice sighed, turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would have taken up her seat anyway, so Laura&#39;s promise was unnecessary. But this was how it was; anytime Laura forgot something, she was always the one to go back and get it. Delice believed this was because she was seeking a mother in their friendship, filling up a hole in Laura&#39;s life that had been left open after her Mother&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their friendship, she had to keep Laura happy and in return, Laura looked out for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was how things were, perfect, just as the best friendships should be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made it past the gates and up the stairs, putting in the key that Laura had given her before she vanished, in the lock. She pushed the door open and went around the table for the bracelet, finding it at the exact spot Laura had described. She had a really good memory, one of the qualities that forged her tremendous hunter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to leave the room, though, the whiff of blood crossed her nose, and she stilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze darted to the lit furnace immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was where it was coming from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face grew cold as she wondered what Laura had been up to. She remembered that her best friend had tossed something in the fire on their way out earlier, saying it wasn&#39;t anything important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a step closer, crouching by the flames with one fear in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Laura getting involved in dark magic?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would she want to be involved with the very thing that killed her mother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat formed on his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seventh bang was here, and now it was time for the execution of their so-called &#39;&#39;judgment&#39;.&#39;&#39; Although he knew she wasn&#39;t here, George couldn&#39;t help but look around and search for his wife, his Zezi. His love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This bastard that seated himself upon that pathetic thing he must think of as a throne must have done something to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had they done to his mate?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;She is not ours!&#39; His wolf snarled in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although his wolf had resigned to silent anger for a while, knowing that doom had finally come upon them for someone irrelevant, the wolf had snapped out of his quietness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was restless, angry, and bitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;She is not ours. We will die for a mere wolf that isn&#39;t even ours!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as his wolf was a master at starting fights, facing what others thought was doom, and coming out victorious, he knew this was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would certainly lose, whether he fought or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the moon, he couldn&#39;t even run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paced in the back of George&#39;s mind, scratching, with rage beyond compare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;She isn&#39;t even ours!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To George, his wolf&#39;s tantrums were none of his problems. Instead, his concern was based on the words he had heard from the Blood-sucking monster that stood some distance in front of him. They made his heart drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to turn Mira?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all his pleadings, that was his mercy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mira was a wolf; two entities couldn&#39;t live in one, one would always fight to conquer. As for the vampire&#39;s turning venom, it always won; then, if it decided that the host didn&#39;t meet the standard of housing it, it turned more into the poison that it was and killed everything in his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His daughter was sick and there was a high possibility that would be her fate. She would have to go through excruciating pain as the venom combats against her wolf, kills it, then kills her slowly too, till her innocent self would beg for death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she survived, which was highly unlikely, her immortal life would be nothing but misery as she would have to live on blood and become one of these monsters. These monsters should have never existed, to begin with. These monsters that killed her own family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, he couldn&#39;t let any of that happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make your peace.&#34; The King&#39;s words were filled with venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand tightened around his daughter and he pulled her closer, her shivering body weak in his arms. She couldn&#39;t fight against anything, she was far too fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He regretted bringing her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He regretted that she was suffering because he hadn&#39;t planned better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mira. His daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy loves you.&#34; Tears streamed down from his cheeks, as he wept into her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would have to do it. He would have to make her go in the most peaceful way possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad--d--&#34; Her teeth were clattering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had failed as a father; he couldn&#39;t even protect his own daughter, but this last thing he would do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Death to his helpless self and to his wonderful daughter, who deserved none of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did it have to come to this? A father taking his own daughter&#39;s life because it was the only option he had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingernails turned into claws. Once this was done, he would let the BloodSucker&#39;s punishment fall on him without a fight. He won&#39;t try to avoid the pain by taking his own life. He owed it to Mira to go through it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips trembled with grief as the memory of all his time with his daughter flashed before his eyes. The pain of knowing that she would never have the chance to understand why he had done this, broke him. But he was ready to look at her and take in her last look of pain from betrayal and suffer from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was doing this for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered Zezi because she was in each of these memories. He missed her. He needed her; needed her right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would understand this. Support him. Maybe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he could turn back the hand of time and leave Mira with Aunt Alice. If only.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy loves you. Mummy loves you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is time. Hand her over already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy loves you very much.&#34; He took in a deep breath, sniffing her in. This would be the last time she would be alive. &#34;Forgive me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a blink, he had pulled her from him, his claws heading right for her heart.</p>
