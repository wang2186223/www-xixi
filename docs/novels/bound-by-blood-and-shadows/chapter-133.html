                <p>Valerick&#39;s actions were fueled by a sort of insanity and an unrestrained thirst. Wherever his lips met her skin, his fangs left an imprint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cries of pain morphed into pleasure, as her claws dug into his back and her hands fisted into his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the speed they had, their clothes were long gone in seconds. Naked bodies rubbed against each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s ragged breathing filled the room, clashing with the scent of their arousal that perfumed the air. It was sweet, it hung to the roof of their mouth and the back of their throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He peppered her neck with ferocious kisses and she did the same to him, her tongue slithering over her mark on him, torturing him as he did her. His claws dug into her thighs, and she threw her head back, as she cried. But his mouth had captured a taut nipple and her body jerked in his arms at the conflicting signals the consecutive actions sent through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tongue flickered and sucked, and her sex ached to have him, as he moved to the other, repeating his action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Moon.&#34;</p>

                <p>She pressed her lips together, moving her hands below her and gripping his length that she had been rutting against. She felt it pulsate in her hand, how veiny it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest rumpled with a groan, as she teased her wet entrance with his bulbous tip, moving it up and down her slit, and pressing it against her clit. She shivered, a cry buried in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason her eyes were still open was because she was driven by the need to see Valerick&#39;s hunger for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he was looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was addictive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intoxicating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh by Moon, she loved it! She shouldn&#39;t but she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loved that he yearned for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh by the Blood, this is happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say my name, it isn&#39;t that thing you feed on that is doing this to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zezi.&#34; He was the one succumbing but she was the one feeling powerless by it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was he doing that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to say something, but his hand slipped through her hair, and went around the nape of her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me into you, Zezi. Let this monster of a mate fuck you. Are you scared that you won&#39;t hate me so much after that? Scared of getting addicted? &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is you that should be afraid,&#34; her voice was disagreeing with her with how breathless it was, her body with how her hand was already sliding him into her with a feverish need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m way past addiction, way past being saved. You know it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thrust into her, deeply. More than she had calculated it would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rough pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feral kisses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hungry passion leaving imprints of fangs and claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Val--valerick!&#34; She could see the moon and beyond it, her body quaking with desire, as he moved quickly in her. Pulling out and jamming back in before she had the time to recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Blood, I don&#39;t want to be saved.&#34; He said against her lips, before stealing her breath away with a rough kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was tight around him, her scent of lily and honey mixed with the sexual craving for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her whimpers were music to his ears, and her feverish whispering of jargons that held his name between them, drove him to the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her walls wet because of him, pulsated for him, the pleasure that only he could give her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted him, and slid him into her with her own hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, by the Blood. Finally!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was so much better than fisting himself to the thoughts of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was way past addicted. Way past obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want to be saved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this was what would kill him, maybe it was okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If having her was his death, maybe that was alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled away, breathless. Her face was wet with tears, her lips swollen, with blood dripping down her lower lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I--- Valerick---&#34; She whispered with urgency, her palms cupping his face, as she looked at him. He nodded along, looking back at her as she fought to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closer and closer to that cliff, to that ecstasy. &#34;Stop--&#34; she threw her head back, hugging him to her chest, her hands digging into his back. &#34;No, please--- don&#39;t stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could no longer hold herself up so she fell on his chest, the pleasure stretching her taut, to the tips of her fingers and her toes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sight was dotted with lust as his fangs dug into her neck and he drew blood. The climax paralyzed her while the wave crashed over her. She could feel her blood being drained, her soul being relentlessly tugged at, and the warm explode of Valerick&#39;s pleasure inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen could be such an excited teenager at times, like right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just couldn&#39;t stop squealing about how glad she was that her Mistress would finally become Queen, and how her supporters&#39; group would go crazy with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had stepped out and returned with about twenty seamstresses. After Valerick, Gwen was the craziest vampire Zezi knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick wanted them to have the Joining Ceremony the next day, and as much as Zezi would want that because of the things she had planned, the timing just wasn&#39;t enough for her family to make it to Lavida.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bond was now completed and whatever she felt towards Valerick before was nothing compared to how she felt now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like their souls could touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this the level of intimacy she was about to miss on with George?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Should I get you a collar?&#34; His voice echoed in her mind and she jumped, still strange to her that he could speak to her through their link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, that their bond was completed, she had been unable to close it from her side like she used to. Which gave her a new fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he able to read her mind now? Her thoughts?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, Milady,&#34; the Seamstress said, assuming she had been the one to cause her to flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Carry on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Or should I get you a necklace, something long enough to rest between your breasts, so I can pick it with my teeth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think about this, Milady?&#34; Gwen asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick was distracting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;You seemed to have liked it when I was handcuffed to the headboard. Should I get chains?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Valerick, please. I&#39;m trying to pick a dress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After last night, things had been different between Zezi and Valerick. It was unexplainable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I&#39;ll get the necklace then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was getting harder and harder for Zezi to keep herself grounded, to not sway totally into Valerick&#39;s lure, to pull away the part of her that had already fallen, upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still hadn&#39;t told her what happened at the den, and she still couldn&#39;t figure out if he knew she poisoned him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he knew, he would have flipped out. Right? He would have been mad at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I found the one you&#39;ll like.&#34; She jumped again. &#34;I love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she felt him pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mistress? You&#39;ve been very quiet, are you alright?&#34; Gwen asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, of course.&#34; Zezi laughed, trying to play it off. &#34;What was the question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you prefer this fabric or this, Milady?&#34; The Seamstress asked and Zezi turned to look at her, catching a glimpse of Gwen in the mirror, who had a smile on her face and a knowing look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, it felt like Gwen knew too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, Gwen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>((At this point, I want to join Gwen&#39;s club.))</p>
