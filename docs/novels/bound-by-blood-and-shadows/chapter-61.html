                <p>Feeling her body go weak, before it all crashed and her eyelids tore open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Akeem asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned against the shelf for a moment, trying to regain herself and take in her environment, while she wiped the blood away from her nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze moved to Akeem and her mind went over what he represented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An opportunity to take down the very person that had put her into this situation. They needed her to get to the King, and she needed them because she couldn&#39;t do it alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of the two sides could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe their offer wasn&#39;t that terrible after all. Maybe they could work together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So even if they were not out to cause the demise of all the vampires, as long as the King was part of the ones they targeted, having him out of the picture at any cost would make her satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she still couldn&#39;t figure out how they could possibly kill him, they seem to have a witch in their midst, the witch should figure it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; she stood upright. &#34;I&#39;ve never been better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell your Pillar we have a deal. As long as the White Circle stays true to me, I&#39;ll stay true to them.&#34; She ended with a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This should be fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My High Pillar will be highly pleased.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel her blood going dry beneath her nose and on top of her lips. She wasn&#39;t bleeding anymore, though, but the fatigue still lingered in her veins. That magic had taken so much from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This also further confirmed that they had a witch in their midst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Akeem could be placed with something of high power like that, he must hold a relatively High Status in their White Circle or to his High Pillar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered how he even joined the White Circle in the first place. What was a human doing in Lavida?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My High Pillar will make thy presence known to you at the right time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thy presence?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These White Circle people and their different wordings for different things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thy is old... but gold anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she would let it slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you shall get introduced to the White Circle but first, you have a task.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a long time since I had a mission. I feel giddy already.&#34; She chuckled, but the blood she hadn&#39;t wiped away made her look a little horrific at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could smell it, taste it. She wanted to get rid of it, but it wasn&#39;t something of urgency; she had to deal with this first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make the King your friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make the King my friend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. It is no news, Werewolf, that your hatred for him runs deep. The rumours are everywhere in the Castle; you struck him and your immunity of the mate bond keeps you alive despite. If you could kill him on your own, you would have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tsked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I&#39;ll work on friendship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We might need something more going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach twisted with hate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That shouldn&#39;t be too difficult.&#34; She snarled, needing to take out her anger on someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem remained unmoved. Compared to the earlier death threat, this was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to be close to him. It&#39;s easier to strike your enemy when he&#39;s within arm&#39;s reach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, she had told some of her soldiers the same thing some time ago, going on missions when she had pretended to be a friend to a foe and easily taken him or her down. Many successful missions, where she had detached her feelings easily from duty, but this one just felt so different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What shall I call you, Werewolf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you already know my name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips tugged up in a smile, and for some reason, she caught the reflection of the light on his bald head; he was slightly shorter than her, too, something she was only now observing. Akeem was fairly pleasing to the eyes and had this imagery that screamed &#39;friend&#39; before he even said a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucky him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That must have helped him out a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome to the Winning side, Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t act so on top. I know I&#39;m essential to your mission. You are using me. Played the card of my family because you know I&#39;ll agree once I&#39;m triggered to remember why I&#39;m here. You&#39;ve done exceptionally well. Your High Pillar should be proud of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile flattered, lacking the sense of absolute victory it had before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m using you too. We are both using each other. That&#39;s partnership.&#34; She shrugged, chuckling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem didn&#39;t find this funny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been told she would be desperate to the point that she would be easily manipulated and he had believed, expecting someone desperate, blind to logic, and high on emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stupid him, forgetting that she was once a War General.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should have planned better. Or maybe not. He still got what he wanted anyway, just that their power play was on the same level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would just have to ensure he kept it like that till she met the High Pillar. She must not be opportune to view herself higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be risky for all of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;History of stones. You just love history.&#34; He said in reference to the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I read vastly, a little knowledge here and there helps.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Moonstone and the Sunstone. You&#39;ll enjoy reading the book. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to attend to the four cuts your claws dug into my neck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was violence-prone. Anything could spike her into madness. He knew that now and maybe one day, he could use it to his High Pillar&#39;s advantage and bring victory to the White Circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could see it now, his cuts but why hadn&#39;t she smelt his blood? She had only smelt hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This human was weird. Maybe that had to do with one of the reasons he was in Lavida or maybe the main reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever it was, he was clearly different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he left her standing in the aisle. She rubbed her sleeves over the bottom of her nose again, trying to get rid of the blood, but it was already too dry, and it hurt her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put the book back on the shelf, no longer interested. When she walked out of the library though, she noticed that the empty seat of the librarian was now filled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was surprised to find out who was sitting in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bade him farewell with an arched eyebrow, and he nodded stiffly before he continued cleaning his cuts with cotton wool and spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now in the hallway, she could still hear him hiss lowly in pain as the spirit jammed the cut sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was human, they didn&#39;t have accelerated healing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt pity for him. Next time, she wouldn&#39;t be so rough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she knew there would be a next time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just made a deal that would require that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind swayed to her task and she sighed, stepping into her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything she had done, how could she possibly befriend the King without looking suspicious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>((Zezi is officially nuts. Lol.))</p>
