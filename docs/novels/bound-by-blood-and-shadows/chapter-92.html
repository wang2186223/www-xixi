                <p>&#34;Or maybe not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The paper got snapped out of her hand and Zezi had to force herself not to offer Laura a dirty look. Instead, she settled deeper into the chair, a light smile dancing on her lips, as her gaze fixed on the ceiling and the beautiful paintings carved upon it, paintings that her mind was too crowed with thoughts to appreciate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever. What are we having for dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something sufficient and rich.&#34; Laura answered, something gleaming in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi bit the inside of her cheek, as much as she was sure she hadn&#39;t given herself away, it seemed Laura was pretty confident about the whole paper situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she even see what was written on it? Wasn&#39;t it supposed to be visible to only her, Akeem or probably members of the White Circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen had lied then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen was really good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she survived tonight, she would ensure to get rid of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would it be sad? Most definitely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would it be necessary? Absolutely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think she means specifically.&#34; Delice&#39;s voice was quiet and Zezi couldn&#39;t help but give her a quick glance. She was a vampire so had certainly seen the paper Laura had given to her. Her face was too passive though, calm as usual with an aura of life hanging around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was difficult to read what state of mind the Vampire was in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afraid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confident?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felling trapped?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just calm, usual, sweet Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I meant that specifically too.&#34; Laura snapped, darting her eyes to the head chair. &#34;I wonder what is taking my brother so long. He has a real surprise in for him. You all have a real surprise in for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Training one&#39;s heart on how to react was something a warrior did, especially when knowing that there were other supernatural creatures around. Zezi had been an expert in that line so far but something about the whole situation made her heart drop. She wasn&#39;t the only one affected this time though, even Delice had given the napkin a little squeeze, her claws nipping slightly into the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Laura know that in her spite for her, she was about to doom her friend too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite how mad she was at Gwen and how caught up Zezi felt in the whole situation, there was still something about it all that her twisted side found hilarious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A giggle bubbled from her throat and she casted Laura a sly glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I honestly can&#39;t wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice cleared her throat. &#34;I&#39;m hungry. They should be serving already. Should I check on the kitchen?&#34; Delice asked, already standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It must feel pressurizing for her, she probably needed the space and the air. Her friend was about to discover just how crazy she was and Zezi just had a feeling, explaining that she was doin it out of love wouldn&#39;t go down well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi knew her fate wouldn&#39;t be any better but still, why couldn&#39;t just stop smiling, her veins were pulsing with excitement and her grin widened even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was wrong with her?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should be terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might lose her head any moment, she shouldn&#39;t be excited about any of this! Had she hit her head during the climbing?! Had she lost her mind?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do that. I&#39;ll go get my brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you you want me to come with you, Princess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no.&#34; Laura gave a high pitched short chuckle. Who did she think she was fooling by acting all calm and unbothered. She was done for and she knew it. &#34;You will be needing all your strength for what will come for you next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promises, promises.&#34; Zezi said to her in a sing song, arching her eyebrow and titling her head along with each word before relaxing back into her chair, and shutting her eyes brifely while she listened to the departing footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She normally wouldn&#39;t be able to hear them but maybe spending time around the BloodSuckers for as long as she had was making her better at these things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoying Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fucking bitch, Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stench of Father&#39;s monsters could be sensed, miles before the center of the disaster. It was gross, it was consuming, a totality of death that Laura detested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hated it even more than the stench of death that Delice had brought to her room last night when she had wept and Laura had been left with no choice but to clean her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knuckles came against the door but the next minute she swung them to hit the wood, it pulled open and her hand froze in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brother had gone to the den.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From head to toe, he was bathed in blood and that stinky green vile, like had had been dipped in it. It reminded her of the night when had had faced their father and his unnatural army.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night his blood had been in the mix of the mess, tonight though, his blood wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered why he had gone to the den, he hadn&#39;t been so mad like that in a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may shut the door behind you or in front of you.&#34; His voice cut through the dim light in his room and she stepped in, a shiver of fear running down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t in the best of mood and if not for the news she had for him, she would leave. Had he even had the chance to check the invitation request she had sent to his room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother.&#34; She ran her hand over the two cornrows that Oliver had take the pain to weave her hair into, while she pushed the door shut. Her hair was way too silky though and from the feel of it, the cornrows would be tumbling loose anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was Oliver anyways?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight was about them... and someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s eyes darted to the table where her invitation request was still laying, untouched. Then she gave his room a quick scrutinizing glance, observing the colour blend and how bright he had tried to make it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as Laura loved her brother, some of his attempts were pathetic. Like his search for light when he himself wasn&#39;t anything close to it. His problem was in him embracing who he was, what he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had his abilities, she would never hide it. She would wear it around her neck for all to see, flaunt it around like the necklace and many jewelries she always adorned herself with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was way too humble for his own good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You at dinner, your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He huffed a sigh, turning his angry eyes at her and she instantly shrunk into herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zezi is there.&#34; The words blurted out of her mouth and she gulped, adding in a rush. &#34;She is waiting for you.&#34;</p>
