                <p>The smell was intoxicating. She wanted to use her wolf speed but the pain jammed into her bones, and she fell to the floor with a thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden movement must have jolted her brain, the pain of the burning mark momentarily easing away, her logic rushing back to her, like a veil that was suddenly being lifted off her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first rain of the green forest. Enticing. Filling. Desperate for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It rushed into her lungs, sent tingles down her spine, and sent sparks dancing across his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body was betraying her, she hated it anytime this happened, hated it anytime her body allowed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked forward in the dark and a realization dawned on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wherever she was headed, it was certainly the King&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi slowly rose to her feet, turning away in the dark and lonely hallway. Anger rushed into her veins when she remembered what he had said to her some time ago. That she would be the one to come to him and beg him to be taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a despicable creature!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And to think that she had almost made that come true, simply because she hadn&#39;t been thinking straight. Had allowed the powers of the bond to consume her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter if it was fated, she should have done better!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking down the empty hallway she started to think, maybe that was even the plan, for her to come to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe that was why he had taken away the guards at her door. Had he not said something about her fading mark during their last dinner? This must be the plan!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a despicable creature. Evil in the form of a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loathed him with the entirety of her very being. The bitterness of the hatred soiled the back of her tongue; her steps quickened while she ensured that it stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The creek she heard from a door opening some distance away was echoing, and it sounded so close that she had stopped and quickly hid by one of the beautiful art pieces hung on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she was lucky, this person would be too busy with the thoughts of where they were headed, to notice her just standing there in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what if the person was the King, and he had come down to the hallway because he had sensed her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that was it, then she was screwed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t sure if she was strong enough to face him like this; the betraying need to see him and have him around was still very much present in her; it was only by a miracle and her pure hatred that she had found strength to return. But having him in her way, might really set her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footsteps came closer, very silent. In fact, the only reason she could hear--wait she didn&#39;t know why she could hear-- oh, the King&#39;s blood. It was the King&#39;s blood in her veins that gave her a heightened hearing, something far from what she would usually hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would it ever fade away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t deny that there were some benefits that she enjoyed from his blood though, like being able to hear the silent footsteps in the hallway right now, but in totality, she still hated that liquid that crossed through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything that was from the King, connected to him, deserved to be despised no matter how little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person passed by and in the dark, she figured it out. That wasn&#39;t the King, unfortunately, she would know him even if he had passed by as a blur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was Lady Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was she sneaking off to?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, if she stayed there and went back to her room, there was a high tendency that she would eventually give in to this need that threatened to consume her and rush back to the King&#39;s door. She could feel the need surging in her veins again, not being too far away from his chambers wasn&#39;t helping either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why hadn&#39;t it left her already? Staying would be very risky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King&#39;s room was a floor above, and the stairs that led to it seemed to be calling upon her to come to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enticing. Luring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she decided to do a little tour, flee from this temptation, and instead find out what got the perfect and flawless Delice sneaking out of the Castle in the middle of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Covering up her scent wasn&#39;t a strong suit for Zezi, but George was an expert at it. He could do it for himself and someone else. The last time he had used his ability, he had used it for both of them while they were fleeing from the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, she missed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi had been following Lady Delice for a while now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice had snuck out of the Castle, through the castle&#39;s main gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had turned out to be an obstacle that almost halted her search, but while Lady Delice had distracted the guards in order to sneak away, Zezi had taken the opportunity to do the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many of the people in the Castle didn&#39;t know the King&#39;s mate anyway; many hadn&#39;t seen her before, and if they did, they didn&#39;t know who she was. So, it was way too easy for her to mumble a lie beneath her breath, about being a maid who needed to go out of the Castle to get bread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she had followed Delice, who went to a stable to rent a horse, all while still hiding her scent and dulling the sound of her heartbeat. She hadn&#39;t even known she could go this far. She had never tried for this long before, not after she had almost gotten caught on a mission because she didn&#39;t know when her control had slipped and her scent was made very present, including her thundering heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she found Lady Delice renting a horse, Zezi prepared her mind for a journey. Vampires loved to use their speed; it got things done faster, so if one of them was using a horse, they were most likely going somewhere really far and didn&#39;t want to get exhausted, or maybe they just wanted to preserve her strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway, this was good. She could keep up with a horse but a vampire, not so much. So this was to her advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice seemed delicate, but Zezi was no fool to trust the outward look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because if Lady Delice was as innocent as she looked and acted, she wouldn&#39;t be sneaking off to somewhere in the dark like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She definitely had a secret and Zezi was determined to find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking twice, Zezi burst into a run after the racing horse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>__</p>
