                <p>Gwen moved to her line of sight, blocking her view of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi frowned, noticing the obstacle with narrowed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shouldn&#39;t have done that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a desperate yank, Zezi pulled the chains she had been bonded with, and the bed collapsed underneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Zezi stood up, her sight was increasingly blue, the chains were still around her wrists and ankles, dragging at their ends, the heavy woods that used to be the ends and tops of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady, you ordered me to--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen didn&#39;t have a chance to complete that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chains swung in the air, the woods hitting her from either side, quickly twisting around her body, flinging her right across the road where she crashed into the dressing table, destroying it, wreaking it down to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, Zezi was in front of her, then by her side, slowly raising Gwen with her hand interlocked into her hair that was before in a bun, now loose, forcing Gwen to look up at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen hissed, baring her fangs, her claws quickly digging into Zezi&#39;s hand that was still in her hair, as she tried to free herself from the punishing grip of her Mistress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could do more than that. In fact, she could attack back, face her with just as much fight, and with the bloodthirsty side of her that her Mistress&#39;s attack was slowly pulling to the surface, she could even dig her fangs into her neck and have a taste of that enticing blood that was vibrant with life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King&#39;s blood was, after all, no longer thick in her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...but still, it was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could not attack the mate of her King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would lead to death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Along with the dominance rolling out and hitting Gwen in waves, she had no choice but to stand on only the ground of defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to hurt you,&#34; Zezi said with a sadistic smile. &#34;And for the sake of your eight bats,&#34; She continued, removing spiltters of the wood buried into her face, watching the large gap of cut that some had left behind, heal slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...don&#39;t make me.&#34; She finally pulled out the last one that had gone a little deep into her forehead, tossing it on the floor that was now stained with her blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen hissed in pain. Being in this kind of state wasn&#39;t anything that she was used to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was no warrior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It stung but luckily, she could feel it heal just as quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi let her go, and she scurried away a little before she paused, watching her Mistress bolt out through the door with speed, the chains dragging along the woods behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still on the floor, in the mess of wood of what used to be a dressing table, and her gaze fixed on the door, Gwen smiled, falling on her back with a low laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lavida would be getting a Queen tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Blood, she would need a lot of strength to narrate everything to her mate and little bats, but first, she had to get this room cleaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the bed, she was certain that her Mistress wouldn&#39;t be needing it for tonight, and that so, for good reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen stood up painfully and started cleaning the room, a smile plastered on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the risk of her Mistress running into any obstacle on the road, she knew she would certainly not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King had ordered early this morning for the hallway to be cleared, and since His Majesty was the only one using the floor, that had been done quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to restrain herself any longer, Gwen gave in to a full-blown happy dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lavida would get a Queen!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of the first rain on the field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never had it been so enticing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never had it been &#39;this&#39; luring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t find the scent and bury her nose in it forever tonight, then she would die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could just feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart would cease its beating from the lack of this new need she had just discovered; she would drop dead to the floor, her body limp, and that would be the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no other way to live besides having this scent all over her, all the time. There was no better thing that existed in this world to be breathed in, besides this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Needed more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clacking of the chains and bumping of the woods on the floor as they dragged behind her, filled the empty hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mate bond calling unto her, made her strong and weak in a way she couldn&#39;t describe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Made her strong in a way that she would do anything to be close to the source of the scent that was luring her in without an ounce of resistance from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the closer she got to the source she so desperately seeked, the weaker she became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze accessed the hallway, everything blue in her sight as she readied herself once again for a potential obstacle which she surprisingly hadn&#39;t ran into yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was this hallway so empty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it always empty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was good that there was no one here though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her steps flatter, making her claws bury into the wall for support, a hiss slipped through her lips, and she sucked in a deep breath before she pushed away from the wall, and her search continued till she finally stopped where her instincts had led her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of a door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand raised to knock, but before she could do that, the wooden frame was pulled open, and there, in the doorway, stood her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been waiting for her, just like he had promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took in a long sniff, closing her eyes, basking in the scent of the first rain that hit her nose and engulfed her. Then she opened her eyes, something animalistic glimmering in those blue orbs of hers, a corner of her lips tugged up in a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mine.&#34; She declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes became a couple of shades darker, those zig-zag lines moving up his neck to his chin, beneath his skin, his eyes the most primal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took her hand, leading her into the room, and she followed eagerly, the chains moving along with her till they were all in, and he shut the door behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands shot up to move around his neck and pulled his face down to hers, so she could seal her lips against his, but he caught them, holding them by the wrists. Restraining her. Leaving her with no choice but to watch him go down on his knees while he worked on the chains around her ankles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand snaked into his hair, pulling a fistful, and a low groan resonated from his chest, making her pull even harder, with an aching pleasure that mounted along with his feathery touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chains went slack and dropped to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he rose up to her slowly, his gaze holding hers, the zig-zag lines now reaching up his cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chaotic blend of his brown skin and the zig-zag blackness beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was it possible for someone to look so glorious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an impatient sigh, she reached for the buttons with hands that were still being held together by her wrists, while he worked on the leather straps of the chains around her hand, ripping them apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he freed her wrists, she reached up for him again but he held them right back by the wrists, raising her hands above her head and pressing her into a wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fixed on the chains on the floor before he looked at the blue eyes that were staring at him with open yearning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That look drove him crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All this to stop yourself from coming to me, Zezi?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gulped, trying to move forward and press herself into him, just having him hovering close was painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thumb moved over her lips, making her stop and look up at him for a moment, observing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His black, slightly hooded eyes were like a beautiful abyss, with equally long black eyelashes for covering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His firmly structured nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arched full eyebrows with little creases at each beginning, like frowning was his default face... and the way his hair curled over his forehead, scattered across.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a piece of art.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there was that black ink, spilled visibly beneath his skin in zig zags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man was breathtaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had she never noticed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, Zezi. Are these...&#34; He looked down at her, the intensity of his gaze making her feel hotter than the mate bond always was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Plentiful dresses...&#34; His hand dropped from her lips and she immediately missed the taste of him, but her need was substituted by the claws that she found slightly dragging up her right thigh, as he pulled up her gowns from a side, the voluminous dresses swishing in the air and echoing through the silent room, along with her hitched breath. &#34;also one of your fool-proof plans?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How very...&#34; His hand stopped and tightened around her mid-thigh, his gaze holding hers with feral intensity, &#34;foolproof.&#34;</p>
