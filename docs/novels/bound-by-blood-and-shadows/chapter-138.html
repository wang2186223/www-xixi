                <p>Lady Delice had been part of the vampires to watch the reunion. It was good to see the little pup. She had enjoyed the company of little Mira when she had been in the Castle a couple of months ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes watered and the urge to go to the grave to see her own little Medallion washed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life would have been so perfect with her son. It would have held the greatest meaning and something told her that she would have been truly happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will go with you,&#34; someone said behind her and she turned, her gaze settling on Akeem who was dressed in a nice pair of red shirt and a darker shape of pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem leaned on the railing of the balcony, his gaze moving to the King, his mate, and her family who were discussing something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will go to the grave with you.&#34; He turned to her with a smile, revealing his perfect set of white teeth. &#34;Medallion needs a visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, taking a slow sip from her glass. &#34;You know you can&#39;t come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile slid off his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? I know you hate going alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Akeem, please drop this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zezi went with you to the grave. More than once, and you just met her. But you know me and still, &#34; he paused, then he added with a low voice, &#34;you never let me be there for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something ran cold in Delice&#39;s veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, he hadn&#39;t pester her about this. She couldn&#39;t believe they were back at it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are there for me a lot of times.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what I&#39;m talking about, Sire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away. &#34;You can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Laura had told Delice about her child&#39;s death ten years and some months ago, something in her had snapped. She had gone feral with grief, ran into the forest, and sank her fangs into the neck of the first victim she had found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A human whose life she had disrupted by her action. She had turned him, became his Sire. Ever since then, he had been loyal to her, not just that, he had tricked himself into believing he was in love with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Countless times, she had told him that the bond a Sire and a Turned shared could be confusing and very intense. She had described how she had felt about the King to him, how insanely overwhelming the feeling could be. She had discouraged him not to indulge in it, but Akeem was very determined that what is felt was more than just an attachment between a Sire and a Turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He treasured her, loved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something ticked in his jaws and he frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has been ten years and some months now. Whatever high attachments turning me had created between us, back then, I&#39;m sure it is gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, absolutely not believing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has been more than two hundred years for me and still... I still think of my Sire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t moved closer but it felt like he had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why wasn&#39;t he understanding that she was more than a century older than him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need someone else to get him off your mind, Sire. You need me.&#34; He didn&#39;t sound cocky, just sincere. Like he was stating something that couldn&#39;t be disputed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t seem to understand what I&#39;m saying to you. It has been more than 200 years for me, ten years is nothing. You are definitely still attached to me because I&#39;m your Sire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were both children when it happened. There was no control and he didn&#39;t know how to do it right, I understand why the connection is strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, it sounded like while he had taken a break from pestering her with his proposal, he had been doing some research. It was impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was grieving when I turned you, I wasn&#39;t even thinking, I lacked control and---&#34; she paused, her eyelids closed and trembling, as she remembered how she had felt the next day when Laura had led her to the victim she had attacked the night before. A human she had almost drained the life out of. She had regretted turning his world upside down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Akeem always said she saved him. He was dying from an illness and that night, he had been heading to a cliff for nature to do what he didn&#39;t have the courage to do himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been looking for something that would kill him, and he had found her instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had found life in death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...I made you into something incomplete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was true, some parts of him remained human, and still, he had access to some vampire abilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she thought was a messy job, was perfection to him. He could still eat food and enjoy it like he had when he was just human. Also, his illness was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What more could he ask for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled. &#34;I think you did well. I&#39;ve told you several times, Sire, you made me perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, he would always say that, but tonight, it sounded very genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe it was just the alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice wasn&#39;t really one to drink, but something about tonight called for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that felt unhappy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, taking a long sip from the wine glass, finally emptying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go with me to the grave. Just once. No more after this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem straightened up. It was happening. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you must keep it a secret from Laura. She doesn&#39;t know I still go there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, Sire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice nodded, &#34;We can grab food for your stomach on our way back---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What can&#39;t I know about?&#34; Laura stumbled to them, drunk. &#34;I tried to listen but the instruments almost blew out my eardrums. I think they should be thrown into the dungeon--&#34; she hiccuped, and Delice handed her empty glass to Akeem, putting her arms around Laura to keep her on her feet instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laura? Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver is very stupid. He has something going on with Riza. I can just feel it in my bones. He is cheating on me.&#34; Then she turned to Akeem. &#34;Leave, the important ones are talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem bowed slightly and in a blink, he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was insulting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Laura turned back to Delice, her gaze unfocused, as she leaned against the railing and Delice, mumbling a complaint. &#34;Their instruments are so loud! What is so happy about this. My Joining Ceremony was better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What you said to Akeem. We were having a conversation and it wasn&#39;t over. I think there is a better way we could have excused him. A polite way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care. Wait---&#34; she pulled away to look at Delice, swaying lightly on her feet. &#34;Tell me you aren&#39;t getting into a relationship with that fetus. You can always get better. A Pureblood and will make you more than the little hybrid you are.&#34; Then, she cupped Delice&#39;s face in her hands. &#34;Look at me. Don&#39;t settle. It will drag you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice gave her a strained smile, as Laura slipped back into her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need my mummy. Didn&#39;t you hear what I said before? I think Oliver is cheating on me with Riza. Comfort me,&#34; she demanded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice really detested being dragged into this. Especially since it had to do with Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure? You know she has Basit and not just that, they are very strict. Also, Riza is old enough to be his mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver can be very charming. You know that.&#34; She squeezed her cheeks. &#34;He curls his beard, and you are doing whatever he wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I must say, if you are this suspicious, then maybe you should speak to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed. &#34;He is probably out there fucking Riza, and Basit is letting him do it. They are probably having a threesome and---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you need more drinks,&#34; Delice smiled, trying to fight the unusual anger that was growing within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was different about tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura didn&#39;t notice though and she continued, falling all over Delice and whining. &#34;How dare he do this to me, Mummy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laura please, behave yourself!&#34;</p>
