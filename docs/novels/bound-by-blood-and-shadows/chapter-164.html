                <p>Just the thought repulsed him; Yet, it had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Mira was an evidence of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loved her too much to hate her just because of what she was but he hated himself for participating in the betrayal he had accused Zezi of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laying with a monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had this happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was oblivious? Had he been r.aped at a point and he didn&#39;t know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of complications was this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt disgusted with himself at the moment, like something had been stolen from him that he would never be able to get back ever again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Moon goddess, let this be a dream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi had pinched him, &#34;It is not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you come in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk.&#34; Then she turned to their daughter. &#34;Mira, Mummy, and Daddy need to talk now, we will be back soon. Gwen will be here with you soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gwen!&#34; She had clapped with happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, the Gwen fever had gotten to her too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi couldn&#39;t even blame her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen was so lovable, and when Mira had asked why she was drinking blood now, Gwen had made her believe it was because she was now a big pup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mira had been very excited about that. She was happy that she no longer felt as sick as she used to anymore too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was really happy and Gwen was teaching her how to handle her powers well, along with Lady Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Mira didn&#39;t hate herself was one thing that was happening right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen had said that if she got better as soon as possible, she would introduce her to her bats who were dying to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was happy with that, it would help Mira to meet children who were more like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was plenty to be grateful to Lady Delice for too, besides her spending a lot of time with Mira and helping out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past Zezi wouldn&#39;t ever expect herself to think this but it was a blessing to have both vampires around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have only ever been with you.&#34; He had said the moment Zezi shut the door behind them. &#34;I am faithful, loyal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi knew he wasn&#39;t lying but he was Mira&#39;s father, so...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t keep saying that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t remember ever being with anyone else!&#34; Frustration bit the edges of his voice and he threw his hands up in the air.  &#34;I didn&#39;t. I can never lay with a vampire, you know how much I hate those Bloodsuckers! They are monsters. No offense to you, or take offense, I don&#39;t care. They are monsters, I would never.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, she didn&#39;t fall out of the sky, did she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It feels like she did with the way we found her.&#34; A corner of his lips arched with a smile despite the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are her father. Nicholas can be annoying but he would never lie about something like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem to be jolly with more and more bloodsuckers.&#34; George folded his arms across him, his anger hard to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are good and this one saved our daughter&#39;s life.&#34; Zezi was getting annoyed too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was annoying that he was always attacking her with something she already felt guilty over. It wasn&#39;t just his family that died, hers did too; he seemed to always forget that she had been there when it all happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was funny that despite his hatred, he had been with a vampire before her experience with Valerick, and had a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How ironic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I agree on that one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, do you remember anyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I---&#34; he paused to think. &#34;I really don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the night we met the witch? We stopped at a bar. You told me you met someone and you almost talked my ears off about losing your virginity to her.&#34; She had thought it was a joke back then, but now it might not just be. &#34;You remember, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t--- wait, I think I do. I am not so sure. They were all wearing masks and -- it is very blurry. All I remember that night is that they gave me a mask I didn&#39;t like.&#34; He sighed, holding his head because it ached. &#34;I need a drink, this is too much for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could reach the door, she held his wrist, stopping him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you had met someone that night, do you think that could have been Mira&#39;s mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George&#39;s brown eyes sparked with the thought, before vengeance filled them and his anger returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would never lay with a bloodsucker.&#34; He snapped his hand away from her grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what if you had been so drunk that you didn&#39;t even know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his anger, George tried to think straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then Mira would have been found by our border, probably three years old or thereabouts, not a baby. We found her in a basket, she hadn&#39;t even grown her first set of teeth. She was a baby.&#34; He sighed again. &#34;Do you know where the bar is in this castle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, time for me to go on an adventure that I, at least, can understand because I don&#39;t understand this.&#34;</p>
