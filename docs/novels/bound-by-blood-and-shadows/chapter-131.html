                <p>The Volakys - the former King&#39;s creations, his undead army made out of blood magic, the terror of the Dark Times. These creatures were to the vampires, as the vampires were to the werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was what the book Zezi had read some months ago had told her about the Dark Times. She imagined that they were even worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension settled in the room, fear consumed the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who told you that?&#34; Laura was the first to snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi frowned, rage flooding into her veins. &#34;Is it true, Princess? Is this something your White Circle has been dabbling in and keeping a secret from the rest of us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be ridiculous, pest!&#34; Laura slammed her hands over the table that stood between them. &#34;No one wants to go back to the Dark Times. Why would you even think that we would bring back the Volakys? They were a terror to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi arched her an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were fools if they thought they could play her around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bigger fools if they thought she wouldn&#39;t notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe she was the biggest fool right now for even dabbling into this in the first place. For getting involved with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such an idiot!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe because you still have contact with your mother, who is supposed to be dead. What are your plans, uh? Do you want to bring her back, Princess? Find her a body, and bring her mad husband with her using your little blood magic tricks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please let us calm down. Don&#39;t let us fight. We don&#39;t need this right now.&#34; Lady Delice&#39;s voice was shaky and that somehow managed to piss off Zezi more. She should be stronger than this! &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please, Mummy. Let us fight!&#34; Laura rushed over to Zezi, her hand tight around the bitch&#39;s neck, feeling her pulse quicken beneath her touch, she laughed into her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answers now, Laura,&#34; Zexi looked unfazed, her anger mountain as she stared up at the vampire, &#34;or you won&#39;t like what I&#39;ll do next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what will you do next, you disgusting vile?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is not---&#34; Lady Delice started to say, trying to pry Laura&#39;s hand off Zezi&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If her heart was still beating, Zezi was sure it would be racing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answers!&#34; She yanked Laura&#39;s hand away from her, with a force she could now command because of the matebond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Princess staggered back and fear glinted in her eyes for a second before it was gone. She spat on the floor, running her boot over it, then she huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we are trying to bring my mother back, but not my Father. He was mad! Why would anyone try to bring him back? Also,&#34; she added, smoothening out her jacket, &#34;he is dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t the same thing said about your mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she didn&#39;t actually die. She found a way around it, but he didn&#39;t. So he is dead, he can&#39;t be brought back. He is dead.&#34; She said the last three words with emphasis, then folded her arms. &#34;You know all you should know now. Feed the King and let things go smoothly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about the Volakys?&#34; Delice beat Zezi to asking that question and Laura turned to her with annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you dumb, Delice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pained look flashed in her eyes. &#34;Well, Laura, I heard it some days at the market that---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Scare Season is approaching. They are selling the costumes. What better stories can they spread if not stories about the Volakys?&#34; Laura cupped Delice&#39;s face between her palms. &#34;If the dog is stupid, I don&#39;t expect you to be too, Royal Adviser. Come on, Delice, you are better than this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice nodded reluctantly, an apology slipping through her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How very sickening to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Princess then told Zezi that she would no longer need to attend the White Circle&#39;s meetings, saying she would need all the time she could get to &#34;feed&#34; the King. Also, they didn&#39;t want to attract any suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we in agreement?&#34; Laura asked, and Delice nodded, but Laura&#39;s gaze was fixed on Zezi, the disgust and hatred in her eyes was unfiltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dare that filthy thing challenge her? How dare she demand for an explanation and not just do as she was fucking told.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura couldn&#39;t wait for the revolution to be done. She would no longer have to pretend like this disgusting creature had the right to stand before her, she would no longer have to endure this nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother would do things better. The right way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, killing her brother was killing two birds with one stone. The bitch was the weaker one in their bond and his death would definitely kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like forever, Zezi finally nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Took the bitch long enough!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing Gwen could say that would make her feel better, but still, here she was trying her absolute best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a sweetheart, Zezi could admit to herself that she didn&#39;t deserve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she wasn&#39;t a vampire. What a complete joy that would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe the King is planning you a surprise,&#34; Gwen offered her a smile, her gaze focused on the untouched meal on the table. &#34;You have to eat, Mistress, it is a new delicacy I prepared. You&#39;ll like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you must have something for dinner, Milady. You haven&#39;t eaten all day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen loved to exaggerate. She had soup this morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to,&#34; Zezi sighed, lying on her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Food was the least of her concerns right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For every hour now, she had gone back to the room and requested to see Valerick. Access had been repeatedly denied, but none of it was as painful as what had happened over an hour ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had heard his voice, he no longer sounded like he was in pain. The door had been left slightly open and his words had danced into her ears. She had heard Valerick tell Nicholas not to let her in. She left before Nicholas would deliver the message with a smug look and all too much glee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since then, she had been on this bed and Gwen had been trying and failing to lift her mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe he just wants to be alone. His Majesty doesn&#39;t want you to see things that will break your heart.&#34; Gwen bit her lower lip. That didn&#39;t come out as planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Zezi hadn&#39;t poisoned him, she would have easily believed that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Falling in love with him was a mistake in her mission, and she didn&#39;t even know when she had done it until it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So all it took was six months for her heart to sway? What a shame. But she was still dedicated to her mission despite it, so that counts, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she could blame the matebond for making her fall all too easy. Maybe---ah, she was way past this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can retire for the night, Gwen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen was determined to stay and Zezi had forced some spoons of her dinner down her throat, just to impress her that she was doing better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only after that, that Gwen took her leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell into silence for a long time, till she suddenly sprung up from bed, her face etched with determination. Ensuring her side of the bond was open, she headed to the mirror and smashed her hand into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The broken pieces sliced her skin but before the pain could even register, she was healing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This bond and its &#34;perks&#34;!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the door, but there was no one there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, there was no one there, she had healed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed something &#34;more&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something THREATENING!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that would make him come to her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something like death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze snapped to the window, and a crazy smile tugged at the corners of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi headed straight to the pool, ensuring her side of the bond was still left open, as she settled into the water and began to drown herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held on to hope, until it was slipping through her fingers, along with her consciousness.</p>
