                <p>Zezi didn&#39;t find Lady Delice and she had tried to see Valerick again but just as expected she had been turned away. That was when she decided to do something crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scaling the walls of the castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was absolute insanity, especially considering the attacks that had been happening lately, also because Zezi wasn&#39;t the best at climbing walls like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a point, when her fingers got tired, she remembered Akeem and how effortlessly he had led her to Lady Delice&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was he? Had he found the other Volakys extract yet?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wooh!&#34; she whispered, almost slipping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to stay focused!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, this was fucking desperate. When did she get this desperate just to see him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pathetic... and stupid too because what if one of these guards below looked up and saw her? They would first assume she was an intruder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if Nature was confirming just how stupid she was, she looked down at that moment and her gaze clashed with Nicholas&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was mortified and embarrassed and if her ears weren&#39;t deceiving her, she had heard Nicholas say &#34;dramatic&#34; beneath his breath before leaving to mind his business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good of him, minding his business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Zezi made it into Valerick&#39;s room through his window. There were certainly better ways to have forced her way in here than this, but she was much too breathless and her fingertips were hurting too much for her to entertain the feeling of stupidity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go! Let me out of here!&#34; Valerick&#39;s voice cut through the darkness and Zezi hurried to his bedside immediately. His eyes were shut, his face scrunched up in displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was having a nightmare, tussling in his bed, his voice sounding strangled. He was begging for something and fighting to be set free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he dreaming about his time in his father&#39;s dungeon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made Zezi&#39;s heart weigh heavily with sadness and a feeling of despair seeped through her veins, then fear and panic, anger .... more anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These weren&#39;t hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valerick.&#34; She said trying to wake him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyelids snapped open, reveling his black souless eyes. He looked nothing awake, his stare was absolutely blank. He staggered to his feet, taking heavy steps as a hand clutched his chest, his claws digging into his flesh and blood running down his body. Those cobwebs lines she knew very much engulfed his face and disappeared beneath his blue silky nightrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was more than terrified. She went around the bed, moving his free hand over her shoulders so that he could remain on his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It hurts so much.&#34; His hand tightened against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What hurts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step towards the bathroom instead, almost falling because she had been unprepared for his move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Water. Take me to water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a couple of tasking movement, Zezi was finally able to get Valerick into the bathroom. He slipped into the tub as she filled it with water and he laid in deeper to the point that he was submerged in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick got better soon enough and he sat in the tub, his gaze set straight ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he spoke, his voice was cold. It felt like the wall between them had returned stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There will be compensation for your time spent here.&#34; He wasn&#39;t even looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For how long were they going to keep on with this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Compensation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes or do I insult you with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You insult me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bathroom walls made their voices echo slightly. Water trickled as Valerick stepped out of the tub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No compensation then. Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi rose to her feet immediately, there was no pleaure in sitting on the cold tiled floor anyways, and watching him step away from her, absolutely drenched wasn&#39;t helping either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sparks were flying across her skin, the bond between them spiking with an electric feeling and the thought that filled her mind were inappropriate for the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was almost as if the bond couldn&#39;t just understand that they were having an argument and the mood wasn&#39;t right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also why was he so beautiful? Who gave him the audacity to look like that at a time like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed, peeling his shirt off and tossing it to the floor as he turned to look at her. &#34;Leave, Zezi. Your presence frustrates me. It&#39;s tiring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arched him an eyebrow, forgetting in that moment all the questions she had planned to ask him, and instead feeling the stab of his words. &#34;I will stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why, do you keep coming to your regret?&#34; He was getting rid of his pants. Why was he getting rid of his pants? It was wet, yes, but why was he getting rid of his pants right now?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he getting rid of everything?! It was distracting! He was distracting!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, what was that? His lower belly was bandaged. Could that be a side effect of killing all the Volakys in the den?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that---&#34; she pointed at it. &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned dismissing her question with a question of his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am your regret, ain&#39;t I? The reason why everything has gone wrong in your life, ain&#39;t I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need a towel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; That certainly didn&#39;t sound like any of the answers he was expecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might be cold.&#34; It was hard to  Don&#39;t you need a towel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need a towel.&#34; Then a glint of mischief snaked into his eyes, his brows still sharpened with anger as he stalked closer her. &#34;What, do I affect you that much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hardly was he within her reach before she threw her hands around his neck, pressing her lips against his. In an instinctive response, he pushed her against the nearest wall, while her fingers slipped into his wet hair, her lips savouring his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a horny trainwreck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled away with difficulty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t going as planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to be stronger than this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was King for goodness sake. There was no temptation he couldn&#39;t resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still keeping his side of the link locked, so that was still great on his path. He was still in full control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop trying to kiss my question out of my head.&#34; His thumb trailed her slightly swollen lower lip. &#34;Answer me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only a hairnreath between them and they both stated into each others stormy gaze, their bodies pressed together, some drpllest of water that still stayed on Valerick&#39;s body dampening Zezi&#39;s dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you affect me this much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed, clearly frustrated with his struggle to stay in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not that question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What question?&#34; Her hands slipped to his back, her claws digging into his skin and drawing blood. In an immediate response, his hand slipped into her hair, pulling a fistful, while the other ensured she stayed pinned to the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no temptation he couldn&#39;t resist... except this one, except her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are so cruel, using the power you have over me without mercy.&#34; He whimpered when her tongue came in contact with the mark on his neck. He gnashed his teeth against the moan that almost slipped back his lips, making the groan rumble in his chest instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His control slipped and so did all the walls he had been holding up.</p>
