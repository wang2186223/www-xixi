                <p>Zezi gulped, folding her arms and leaning back into her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should be in the library, she should be meeting Akeem, Akeem should be introducing her to his High Pillar, her mission should be in motion by now but she had foolishly allowed her emotions to sway her and now she had missed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if they left the library, taking her absense the wrong way and decided she would never join the White Circle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t sound as threatening as it should when she thought about it. She knew she was important to them and it would take them much more to decide that they didn&#39;t need her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she couldn&#39;t be sure. She didn&#39;t know the White Circle enough to know how their minds worked. If they even decide they didn&#39;t need her anymore, well, that would be alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What raised her fear though was if the White Circle sent death after her. They could even send Akeem to silence her, the mission would be smooth and easy for him, considering the qualities he possessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no aura, and he hide his heartbeat perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King would never be able to trace that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another option was for them to kill her with Wolfsbane, but that will only alert the King of their presence and give them leads. They would not want to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned further into the seat, almost becoming on with it as she tried to steady herself to the rhythmic movement of the carriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She missed the pack, sh missed using cars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had Lady Delice not used a car? Did she not have one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, the cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They couldn&#39;t drive a car through that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi bit her lower lip before releasing it yet again from her teeth&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as she tried to push her worry about the White Circle aside, it bugged her. She needed them as much as they needed her. She didn&#39;t know a way she could kill the King and carry out her revenge, she was at a complete lose of how to put her burning hatred into use without them and that witch in their midst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only hoped that when she ran up to the library, Akeem would be there waiting for her, along with his High Pillar. If they were mad by the time she got there, she would handle it. There was no heat that was too much for her to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah. She really shouldn&#39;t have come along with Lady Delice tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had really messed up her plans!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Lady Zezi.&#34; Lady Delice&#39;s voice cut into her mind, bringing her attention back to the carriage and how uncomfortable it was. She felt her butt slidding off the leather seat slowly and she sat up adjusting herself. If she were to fall on the carriage floor, it would be really awkward. And she would rather die than have herself look like a scribbling idiot in front of a vampire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really appreciate that you have come with me tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anger that was boiling in her veins about what she was probably missing right now, didn&#39;t let her think twice. The desperate need for her not to be seen in the light of a friend or any warm connection build up whatsoever, fired into her lungs, compressing into words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only did that because I missed stepping out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a cherry on top, she added. &#34;I only used you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something flashed in Delice&#39;s eyes as she watched Zezi whose eyes were fixed on the ceiling of the carriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded at the words, her demeanour betraying no other emotion than the other she had already let out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you late for a meeting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi could feel her intestines twisting into painful knots at that question. Had she made herself that obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stupid!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All her years of being a Zeta and she allowed herself to be careless enough around an enemy to the extent that they could figure her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How long had she spent around Lady Delice tonight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever long hours they were, she wished she could take them back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as it seem not to have done anything, Zezi could feel that something in her had changed. She couldn&#39;t figure out what it was yet but she hoped to kill it before it started to manifest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever it was, she was sure it wasn&#39;t good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One with the King?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi did not answered, wanting to kill any hoped that were building up her mind about them being any sought of close buddies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was no way Toxic Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for holding you for so long. You are probably late and His Majesty does not like to be kept waiting--&#34; her words dissolved into a gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Blood! He will know you went outside! He would have checked for you. He would have--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi zoned her out, watching her jitter while she audibly ran through different thoughts about what the King might do when he discovers what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had even said that he might have even sent soldiers out to find them. She was certain she would sleep in the dungeon, worried that Laura might not come to her rescue as she would normally do, and even if she did, she had said the King would still do as he pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fear of losing her title of the Royal Advisor shone through her eyes as she said it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi almost felt moved to say a word or two to stop her from worrying, but she caught herself midway and her brows knitted in worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What rubbish!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would love to dwell in anger but deep down, she knew that wasn&#39;t the only thing that she was feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In all honesty, Zezi didn&#39;t know how to feel about Delice now that she knew of her sorrowful past. It made her more human than monster in the light that Zezi had set to look from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to get involved with any Vampire but the more time she tried to steer away from them, the more she seemed to get more entangled in this hopeless situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These two vampires, one being undoundly Gwen and the other being Lady Delice, were already making themselves of a little importance in her life. Sharing things that she could real to and helping her in their own ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished they could be mean and wicked towards her. She wished they showed her a little more hatred. She wished Gwen would state more and more about how she was unworthy like Laura would always do, she wished Delice will act up on jealousy in ways that she could at least see and believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as she wanted to hold on to emotions that would build her hatred for them, seeing was believing and she wasn&#39;t really seeing a lot of things that would hold her hatred up and solid like an unshaken gold throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting upright, she came to a conclusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would just have to be fast with her part of the White Circle&#39;s mission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akeem and his High Pillar had better be at that damn Library by the time she got there, or else, she would figure out a way to do it all on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, her heart was already betraying her, swaying and feeling pity for Lady Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who knew what would happen next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Genuine feelings for the King?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over her dead body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they got to the Castle, Zezi was angrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to distract herself from all of that pity, she had taken it upon herself to remind herself one by one, all the things that the Vampires had done to her kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she remembered, the more her frown deepened, the more her brows knitted together, her lips pressed in a straight line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anger grew so much that she had half a mind to lurch herself at Lady Delice, slash her throat open while she yanked out her heart and watch the ever cold and still body of muscles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice didn&#39;t look like the type that would fight too much, but one never knew an opponent fully until they were backed to the wall and had no where to run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a whiff of madness that Zezi always caught up in Lady Delice&#39;s aura, no matter how gentle she looked, and no matter how much she was craving to dig her claws into the throat of a vampire, doing that now would ruin everything she had been carefully laying out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crave was illogical, yet it remained, strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not to give into this wild thought, she had to dig her claw into her palm to distract herself with the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The carriage had barely stopped before she bursted out of it. Skillfully slipping through the door, she was gone before Lady Delice could even stop her and talk more about her fears and how it seemed they had luckily escape from the King&#39;s suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have time for that right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to see Akeem and his High Pillar right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted them to discuss and get the plan into motion already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi eyes caught a glimpse of the clock as she rushed up stairs, the clock had just struck 3 am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice in her head rang, but she&#39;d be doomed to listen to that.</p>
