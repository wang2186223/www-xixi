                <p>&#34;How very kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as she wanted to be snappy, her nude position under this sheet wasn&#39;t helping. Also, the mate bond hitting her right now was making her increasingly weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she remembered that George&#39;s mark was gone and she was now in for a brutal fight with no advantage to her side anymore. Nothing to keep her sanity off wanting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze fell upon his chest and how hickeys were littered across it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should try to cover that up.&#34; She gritted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; He looked down at his chest then back up at her. &#34;I think I want to flaunt them, but if you ask nicely...&#34; He stopped, not going any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is not about me.&#34; She snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, it is. You are the only that can do this to me and you know it,&#34; his voice dropped to a whisper that sent unwanted shivers down her spine, &#34;the whole castle knows it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right, and accepting that was a turtore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The minute Zezi had been able to get out of the King&#39;s room, she had ran right back to her room and locked the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she had met her prison sparkling clean and arranged with a couple of new things, like the dressing table and the bed that she clearly remembered destroying, made her heart feel a little heavy, as she dropped the heap of dressing on one side of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately and unfortunately, she could now remember everything and asides from that, she was designed with hickeys around her neck and smelt a lot like the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there was this feeling of a new awareness that she had of the King. Of course, she could be expected to go through this, in nature, she was now an unmated wolf who had her mate around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting much time, she dashed into the bathroom, refusing to listen to her body and get rid of the scent instead of basking in it, as her body wanted. She had taken her time to wash any part that she remembered him touching, most especially her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to go tender on it though. The intensity of his kisses on that part of her skin and made it a little sore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as she still hated him, she appreciated that he hadn&#39;t taken her last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It left a bitter taste in her mouth to know that a monster was capable of such good. Something about that felt threatening to the views she held strongly unto.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most unmated werewolves with their mates around always got marked and mated on the full moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the law of nature, one that only few had been strong enough to cheat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the pack, the two werewolves would find each other and once that was done, there would be nothing standing in their way to begin and complete the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that he had not been as crazy as she was could be because he was different, a monst-- child of a monster, a vampire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, the fact that he had stayed close enough to her to suppress her heat and not cause her pain, yet had not gone any further, was a characteristic too considerate for a monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was grateful and hated it at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It gave her mixed feelings that even the warm water running down her skin from th shower, couldn&#39;t wash away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like hours, Zezi turned off the shower and left the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her chest, while she dried her hair with a small one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed to the wardrobe to get a dress, forgetting that she had most of them on the bed already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady?&#34; Gwen called out and as much as Ivy was tired, she was also hungry, having skipped most of her meal yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, wordlessly, she opened the door and Gwen wheeled in the trolley with a smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Milady. How are you feeling?&#34; Gwen asked, her voice vibrant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; The word slipped out through heavy lips, as Ivy shut the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went to the bed, trying to pick a dress but they each smelt like him and she tossed them to the floor in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Breakfast is served. Akuko soup, to replenish your strength.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not tired.&#34; Zezi cut her off quickly, her voice filled with guilt that she hadn&#39;t even been accused of yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, because that wood across my face, I believe must have taken a lot of your strength, Milady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi smiled, apologetically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand.&#34;Her smile widened. &#34;Please, come and eat. I had to learn the dish overnight. It is rumoured as a werewolf favourite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi sniffed in the air and she nodded, a smile crossing her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The vegetable is medicinal too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi walked past her to see what was in the plate, a look of approval on her face, then she stopped, feeling Gwen&#39;s eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Moon, the hickeys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was looking at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi pressed her lips together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she was to say one word about them, Gwen would take the opportunity and start talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason why she wasn&#39;t yet was because, she didn&#39;t want to offend her Mistress and considering how her Mistress had been acting about her relationship with the King, it would be wise to be careful with words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she was waiting for her to say something first, and that would decide if she would talk about it excitedly or not with as much excitement. Gwen had thought about not talking about it at all, but she knew how she was, that was impossible. She didn&#39;t think she would be able to hide her excitement either, but she could try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is your face? And everywhere I hit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I must have cost you a lot of work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quit apologizing, my Lady. I was way too happy doing it.&#34; Gwen said, easing from one feet to another. She was one second away from squealing. &#34;It was no work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi bit the inside of her lower lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen sometimes was like an open book, she was clearly excited and she wanted the tea, but Zezi didn&#39;t share her joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had hoped George&#39;s mate would hold her just a little longer, and had dreaded this moment right from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan for the White Circle was to establish an unsuspecting friendship with the King, but with George&#39;s mark gone, and the mate bond fully getting involved, would this not lead to an unplanned mess?</p>
