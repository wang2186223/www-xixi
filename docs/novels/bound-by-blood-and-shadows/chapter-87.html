                <p>&#34;Oliver was flirting with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s hands stilled around Delice&#39;s own, her grip on the wet towel a little tight before it loosened it and a scoff escaped her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver would never flirt with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the dripping water into the bowl cut through the silence of the room. Laura pulled the small towel out of the bowl again, draining the liquid by squeezing it tight, the liquid dropping back into the bowl, before placing it on Delice&#39;s shoulder blade and pulling it down to her wrist, as she tried to wash away that disgusting grave scent away from her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura had already told her to get rid of her gown because of the putrid lifeless aura that hung, not only to the sleeves of it but the whole gown in general.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lifeless aura not being the type she liked. It left a bitter taste on her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who in their right mind would go to a place as stinky as that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice, of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t in her right mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that didn&#39;t matter, Laura would be doomed if she had that awful scent stinking up the place, or ruin the good frangnace and essence of her herbs. So she had made Delice toss the gown into the furnace immediately she took it off. She hoped the fire would be hot enough to burn the vile out of it. Even after that, she would still need to get rid of the ashes, it was just a sought of contamination she couldn&#39;t risk allowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Delice sitting on the dressing chair, naked and wrapped in a towel that Laura would make sure to get rid of after this, while Laura knelt down by her side, cleaning her with the small wet towel in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he was.&#34; Delice&#39;s voice was quiet, the cold water that hit her skin didn&#39;t do anything to her, the pain that was in her heart was still strong enough for her to feel numb from everythinylg else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura chuckled, as she brushed the towel across her neck one last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; she scoffed again, a chuckle thrown into the mix. &#34;You are just imagining things.&#34;Delice watched Laura as she rose up to her feet, her gaze intense and a twinkle of assurance in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sacrifice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice in her head said as it always did, and she nodded lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe.&#34; Needing to do something with her hands, she ran her fingers through her hair before tucking it behind her ear, as she blinked. The need to buttress her acknowledgment of defeat, pushed more words out of her mouth. &#34;I was quite disoriented tonight, so I believe you are right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura flashed her a fanged smile, as she always did anytime she was trying to control her nervousness. Then she headed towards the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have been thinking about Oliver, worried that he had indeed done what she had earlier said he did, but her rainbow dressed up truth must have made her feel better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sacrifice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Laura came back, she took a seat by her feet, playing with her extended claws while she laid them on her laps. Then her claws traced patterns on the surface of the white towel Delice had warpped around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver makes me happy.&#34; The words came out of her mouth, standing out against the bubbling sound of the herbs in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, each of those words seem to have manifested into daggers, slashing Delice at every spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because of who Oliver was, but because of Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all hurt because it was Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to be with Oliver and I want you to be okay with it. Will you do that for me?&#34; She craned her head up, staring straight at Delice whose face showed no sign of pain or anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was calm and her lips were tugged up into that smile that her face seemed to have permanently fixed itself into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no telling if she could change it even if she tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice nodded, her lips stretching into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I will. Anything to make you happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She patted her head and Laura chuckled, resting her head back on her laps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are such a mummy.&#34; She teased and Delice chuckled lightly too, till their laughter died out and silence fell in between them, as they both got sucked into their trains of thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver had been flirting with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice couldn&#39;t tell a lie to save her life and the minute her lips had formed the first word of her sentence, Laura knew she only had the truth to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She believed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Totally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even far before she said it, Laura could sense it from a while away that he would do just that and more if given the chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thing was that, Oliver never got over Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those years while she had given him everything and made him the Governor of the Left Province by selling his good side to her brother, all those times while she fought for him, all he had on his mind was Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice in the morning, Delice in the afternoon, Delice at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice everytime!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never said it but Laura wasn&#39;t on to be fooled, even when he looked at her sometimes, she knew he had tried to lie to himself that she was Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had known that going after her that night would lead to his separation from Delice, he would never had followed her command of going down on his knees and burying his face in-between her thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that, and that was why she had gone to him when she was certain that Delice would walk in on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was for valid reasons, reasons being that Oliver didn&#39;t know what he wanted, and Delice could handle the kind of vampire Oliver was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver loved to be controlled, to be told what to do, to be dominated and Delice could do none of those.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there was anyone sacrificing their desires in this situation, for everyone to be happy, then it was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides it didn&#39;t matter who Oliver thought he was in love with, or who he thought he wanted, what mattered was who Oliver needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed her and she was sacrificing so much for him to have that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sacrificing so much for the everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura was the one fixing the puzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the one putting everybody in their right places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the one making sacrifices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the one who deserved to be happy with whosoever she chose!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Delice, once again, Laura was the one painstakingly making the decisions for her, because she was far too weak to even attempt to make them for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the pillar holding everyone on their feet, without her, all that would be left would be chaos.</p>
