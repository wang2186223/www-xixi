                <p>Her hand tightened around the doorknob while the other tightened around her towel. He stood there by the door rigid, his eyes on her. Taking note of her wet hair and her very exposed neck. His eyes darted to the mark and once again, something ticked in his jaws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were Gwen,&#34; she managed to say but he said nothing, his eyes turning darker and darker with every lingering moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to close the door. Fear rushed through her veins then as the image of what she saw in the hallway cross through her mind. She wanted to sink into herself and stay far away from him yet she couldn&#39;t even close the freaking door?! Why couldn&#39;t she just look away from his burning gaze? It was like as if her feelings were out of her reigns of control, compelling her and drawing her to him. Yet there was fear, a large tussling fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard someone coming up the door at that moment and he did too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty, I was just wondering...&#34; A male voice started to say but before the person could get to the door, the door slammed shut in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She staggered back then, regaining her composure. She didn&#39;t allowed herself to think of how stupid she must have looked back then or chastise herself for being lost in the eyes of a monster as always, nor could she process the fear and try to calm herself down. That would just be a waste of time and that wasn&#39;t going to do her any good right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found a dress and pulled it over her head, when she was done. She went to the door and pulled it opened. Before he even took a step in, she went back immediately, leaving between them a good amount of space. He noticed but he stepped in anyways, followed by a man that looked a lot older. He was lean and had glasses that sat on the bridge of his nose. It looked like his eyes were running deep into his skull, like they&#39;ve seen too much. He must have been the one talking some moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Zezi, I have heard so much about you,&#34; the man started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good things, I hope?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must be one of them, one of those monsters but he looked like a doctor, the white coat on it screamed it already, and it was always wise to make friends with doctors wherever you go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Doctor Bruce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi smiled and took the shake. It was firm and short, his skin was a little wrinkly too. How old was he? A thousand years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each movement she made, she could feel his gaze on her neck. Her hand came up slowly to cover George&#39;s mark, she suddenly felt protective of it. Something about the way he looked at it made her really worried and afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get it off her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard his voice interrupt whatever speech Doctor Bruce was starting to give her about how wonderful a Kingdom Lavida was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was soronous to her ears and it held so much power. It was almost as if she had missed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty, I need...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get that mark off her immediately. I hate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi staggered back, her back coming in contact with the wall. She placed her hand over the mark on her neck and looked up at him. He was far away by the window but she still felt like he was so close to her, like she could even reach out and touch. She indeed felt fear for him, not the coldness, and hatred in his eyes made her flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted them to break the bond she had with George. She had to do something and she had to do it quick. If this bond came off, then there would be nothing restraining her from falling into the power of the mate bond she had with the King. There would be nothing controlling her. All hell would break lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; She squealed out, frightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He arched an eyebrow at her. A silent question of if she was challenging him on this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was! She was also willing to face the consequences whatever that might be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is my mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One you chose,&#34; he corrected, his voice cold. &#34;Breaking the bond will not kill you, nor him. You are not real mates after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi gave a short mocking laughter and something in his eyes flickered. She could have sworn that it was confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what they told you? George is my real mate, the bond we share was given to us by the Moon Goddess. You know what is wrong? This thing that is happening right here,&#34; she gestured her hand between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what is wrong. I cannot have another mate since I already have one mate. Don&#39;t you think about it? We are of two different kinds, why would we be mates? Whatever we have isn&#39;t a mate bond, it is a mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her statement, the room felt suddenly cold and silence reign. Her hand tightened on that part of her neck and she looked straight at him, while she ensured her heart wasn&#39;t racing wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to tell what he was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he believe her? She couldn&#39;t tell, but there was one thing that she could see in his eyes. It was anger, one that she couldn&#39;t explain. One that burnt everything in its path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up straight, pushing away from the wall he had leaned against, and she immediately became on guard but contrary to what she thought, he didn&#39;t come close to her. He only tucked his hands into his pockets and nodded slightly, burying his emotions as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run the tests,&#34; he said, his eyes still on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! George is my mate! If you do this it will kill him, it will kill him!&#34; She begged desperately, trying hard to get away from the approaching doctor. Some nurses busted in, she could feel them doing something to her amidst her struggles, but she couldn&#39;t tell what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon her struggles dwindled, till it finally stopped, her eyes clouding over before she finally fell unconscious.</p>
