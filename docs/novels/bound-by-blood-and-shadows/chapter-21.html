                <p>She hurried to bed immediately and Mira readily leaped into her embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crying even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed her to stop crying. She might fall unconscious and this time around, the Pack Infirmary wasn&#39;t anywhere nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few pats on her back and she was doing okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One problem solved to a good extent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then there was another worry that took over Zezi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was George?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She listened in so that she could hear if George was anywhere nearby, but with how weak her body was and how it was focusing on healing itself, her abilities were as strong as they would have been if she wasn&#39;t so badly hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to call out for him but she remembered that she had been saved from his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if his wolf was still in control? What about the Being that had saved her? What if it was killing him and it would move to her and Mira next?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or what if the vampires were here already?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt hot all over, not in a good way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe it was the vampires but not one that was loyal to the King. What if it was one of the King&#39;s enemies that was planning to attack her to get to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A King always had enemies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, she wasn&#39;t thinking straight anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed her mouth, allowing George&#39;s name to die in her throat while she pulled her daughter close, standing up to her feet, ready to defend them if anything goes wrong. Her eyes searching for an escape route.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw the distant light at the opening of the cave and followed instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would have to leave with Mira, she hoped George was okay and even if he wasn&#39;t, she knew that he would have wanted her to escape with Mira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew she would face punishment if she returned to the King but she would rather die than have anything happen to her daughter in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow it felt safer to be in the Castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closer to the light she got, till she heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The echo of a stone dropping on the floor behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a shadow of a tall figure standing in front of her, blocking away the light she was heading to, standing firmly in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Till he leaned against the cave wall like he was absolutely exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes no longer wild red with his wolf&#39;s beastly insanity, as he leaned against the wall in support while he walked closer to get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he had been the one to safe her after all. Saved her from himself once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For how long would she continue to do this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped back immediately, her claws and canines at ready, growling at him threateningly to stay away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me, Zezi.&#34; He said in a pained voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew he was himself once again, but she had been guided by instincts to protect them from him nevertheless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hurt you again. I know, I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apologizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right from the start of their relationship, that had been the unbreakable cycle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wolf would hurt her then he would apologize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George gasped, his hand holding his head from a headache that he was still struggling with as a result of the way he had snatched back the control from his wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had seen what his wolf was doing and he had lost it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are bleeding.&#34; Zezi said, observing the red liquid that slowly moved down his nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rub it off, surprised that he had bled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wolf was really getting a lot to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever werewolves chose their mates, their wolves sometimes had no problems with them, if they did, they would succumb as time went on, and if after all that time, the wolf still didn&#39;t like the chosen mate, they would simply ignore the whole situation and do only that which duty mandated them to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only time wolves would become as violent as George&#39;s wolf was if there was a deep sense of attachment that it had developed with the real mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George had never met his real mate before, in fact, he had a belief that he would never. He had also never had any attachment with any female before except Zezi. Sure he had sex with a couple of females while they were on the run, that had been before Zezi had made her proposal and he had accepted. None of those females had he seen twice and if any had been his mate, he would have known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only conclusion they had gotten to was that George&#39;s wolf was like that because he came from a long line of Alphas. Wolves with Alpha blood always preferred their Moon Goddess given mates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After apologizing, George would mostly try to make it up to her with words or actions or both but she had no time for that right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to get out of here,&#34; she said and without looking back at him, she started maneuvering her way around the cave with George following behind. A couple of times, he had crashed to the ground, weak and tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as she still angry with him, he was George and she cared about him... a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she went back, pulled his arm around her neck, her hold still firm on her daughter and miraculously this time, they came out at the other of the cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The breeze felt heavenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun, a good sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel the invisible chains around her go slack and fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled blatantly at her daughter, tears in her eyes, while she hugged her, then she felt large arms go around her too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We made it, my Love,&#34; George said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stiffened before she relaxed into an embrace. She observed how her skin wasn&#39;t crawling with disgust too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being far away from the King and that ridiculous bond made her feel more like herself once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank Moon Goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warm lips that sealed against her lips brought her right out of her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the part where she would reciprocate his act of intimacy and tell herself that although he had almost killed her, that had been his wolf and not him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet this time around, she could not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to pull away from him, attempting to end the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss ended quicker than George had planned, not for Zezi&#39;s weird movement, because he was absolutely certain she wasn&#39;t trying to push him away, but for a snickering voice and a high pitched laughter that forcefully pulled them apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my brother is going to kill you alright.&#34;</p>
