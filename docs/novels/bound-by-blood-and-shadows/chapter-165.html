                <p>George had found the bar, although he wasn&#39;t a type to love alcohol, this time around it had brought him some comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A vampire had stepped into the bar a while later and anger rose in him, his skin prickled with hatred and he sent her a glare despite knowing that she was his daughter&#39;s saviour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice flinched slightly at his glare but she didn&#39;t take any offense. It was him again and not his wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his wolf, she shared an understanding, which was strange but that was how things were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How ironic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t it his beast that was supposed to hate the vampires even more?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank up for saving my daughter&#39;s life.&#34; He said, raising a bottle of alcohol to his lips. That brand of alcohol would make him drunk sooner than he was prepared for. &#34;Last night was a mistake. It will not happen again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice smiled and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had expected that he would say that. The fact that last night had even happened at all was still very surprising to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up, walked out of the bar, and moved around Lady Delice in a deliberately avoidant manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if, if he were to accidentally touch her, he would burn from the inside and evaporate into thin air with no evidence of his death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice watched him leave, she needed the time alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had some things to think about anyway. She still hadn&#39;t seen Akeem and she was starting to get worried about him, the White Circle hadn&#39;t said anything yet and the strange Volakys that kept on attacking every now and then, worried her. Laura was in a state of grief and as much as she hated Oliver, it was saddening that he was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped that Mira wouldn&#39;t find being a vampire too difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, by the Blood, so many things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then she noticed how suddenly George had stopped before the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned back to her with a smile on his face, his eyes the red shade that had comforted her yesterday and she knew immediately, who was speaking to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was no mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone live like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The primal side and their human side were at two absolutely different sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was a blessing that she never got her wolf and she had become a vampire instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was walking back to her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is nice to see you.&#34; He pulled her into an embrace, without warning and she stiffened, even with her sharp senses, she hadn&#39;t seen that coming. When he pulled away, she noticed how his eyes were a little dazed with the effect of the alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are drunk. Your human side would be very mad if you linger in my company. You must go.&#34; She sat down on the bar stool, by the bar table, turning her back to him, but he went around her, so that she was looking at him once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do not tell me what to do,&#34; his voice sounded gruff with stubbornness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is going to be mad--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let him be mad. We never agree on things like this,&#34; George settled on the bar stool in front of her, putting his bottle on the bar table, &#34;I have learnt to live with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things like this? What did that mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you feel about Mira being your real daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It feels like...&#34; He paused, searching for the word. &#34;Like normalcy. She had always felt like mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And do you know her mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, taking a swing from the bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;I don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to think about it. It makes everything complicated, I came here to run away from that. You know what? Let us play a game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up, pouring her alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a disadvantage to you, whatever it is.&#34; Delice clicked her claws against the small glass. &#34;I hardly get drunk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know the rules yet,&#34; he said with a mischievous smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are the rules? What kind of game is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite herself, Delice was curious and maybe a little excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A shadow game. I say a word and you try to create it with shadows. You can use anything around to do it. I count to ten and if you haven&#39;t done it yet, you take a shot. Same thing with me. Also normal speed please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, no.&#34; She laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice had never played this type of game before, quickly she looked around the room observing the source of the light, and calculating in her mind what available materials she could use to her advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, will you play with me?&#34; He asked with the most adorable pleading eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow smile played on Delice&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, the cute look was gone, and mischief set in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first word was a mountain, Lady Delice had been able to easily create that with her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, steady the game began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words got harder to recreate and more than George&#39;s wolf, Last Delice was the one taking the shots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You rigged it.&#34; She said with a loud laughter and George shook his head. &#34;we can take this shot together just so you won&#39;t feel lonely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I will win this game squarely. Next, friendship!&#34; Then she counted, &#34;1...2...3....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed her hand and she stopped, as he pulled her from the stool, so the shadows of them holding hands could be cast on the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; he pointed at the wall, then whispered, &#34;friendship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment passed between them and Delice felt a strange warmth in her heart that had stopped beating a long time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Is it supposed to be allowed to use your opponent to win?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There were no rules against it. Come on, look at that. We are here, playing a game, happy. We are friends. This is friendship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, pulling her hand away and taking her seat back at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that I know I can make use of you, I am about to win this game. Be prepared to lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Defeat, eww.&#34; He dramatized. &#34;Not something I like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, and they laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They played their game long into the night.</p>
