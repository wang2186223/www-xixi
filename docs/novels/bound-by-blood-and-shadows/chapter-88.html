                <p>Zezi&#39;s head was ringing bells by the time she woke up but that was what she got for falling asleep on the library cold, hard floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat up slowly, opening her eyes with the realization that she was, in fact, not in the library but in her room. Her lips pressed together in a line, as she ran her fingers through her black tangled hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone had brought her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of her grabbing someone in her flashed through her mind and her frown deepened, recognizing the rainy scent that had flooded her senses at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The theories she had on her mind about his reason for being at the library last night, didn&#39;t allow her know precisely how to felt about his gentlemanly gesture. She would just have to figure that out when she runs into him deliberately today. Although she still hadn&#39;t been able to meet Akeem and his so called High Pillar yet, she had no intention to let that slow down her plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her feet moved to the floor and she rose up from the bed all too quickly, that she had felt dizziness hit her head halfway through. Her eyelids fell shut as she tried to stable herself, her fingers rubbing tenderly against her forehead, and she remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, she pried her eyes opened, a gasp slipping through her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had dreamt about the ambush in her home pack again, but that wasn&#39;t all, she had also had a nightmare that the King would do the same to the Capital and every werewolf pack that existed soon. In her dream, he had ambushed the Capital, turned their little Mira -who hadn&#39;t make it, slashed George into different pieces and littered his remains on the open field, while he made her watch. She had wept, a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hatred she felt for him intensified from the images that crossed through her mind, and somehow she felt that if she didn&#39;t move along with her plans already, her kind would soon meet it&#39;s extinct in his cruel hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would be like his father and history would repeat itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to do something before it does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a knock at the door, so she to answer it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That reminded her that she had locked the door yesterday and the King must have found it locked too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must have a key to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That knowledge didn&#39;t faze her, she already knew that but it still somehow managed to do something in her that she couldn&#39;t explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady---&#34; Gwen&#39;s voice stopped short as she rolled a trolley inside, she looked straight at Zezi&#39;s just woken state before a smile broke across her lips. &#34;You look perfect, Milady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uuugh. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s too early for the lies, Gwen.&#34; Zezi groaned, rubbing her hands around her neck. She really shouldn&#39;t had fallen asleep on that library floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must look hideous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought that he must have carried her by himself, in his arms, close to his body, gave her two contradictory feelings that she easy felt with anything connected to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An undeniable pleasure and complete rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chicken noodle soup.&#34; Gwen laid the plates on the table and Zezi stopped dead in her tracks. &#34;I&#39;ve been dabbling into werewolf delicacies. Taste it, taste it, taste it! Tell me if I am getting close to being your worthy chef, Milady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi narrowed her eyes at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you up to, Gwen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I beg your pardon, milady?&#34; She asked, fumbling with the hem of her grey apron, her lips threatening to break into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi cocked her an eyebrow but the way she looked like a frustrated chicken that had its feathers everywhere, didn&#39;t help her look one bit serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chicken noodle soup, uhn?&#34; She asked, staring down at her while Gwen stared right back, the stare continued for a while before Gwen finally broke the gaze, words tumbling out of her mouth right after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chicken noodle soup is a delicacy to help strengthen the womb. My Mistress should take it because it will give us strong heirs and with my Mistress having his Majesty&#39;s scent around her, has my hopes highly peaked.&#34; Her hands extended to the table, taking the plate and holding it in between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Milady, tell me you have a big appetite this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you cooked a lot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Her voice sounded like a suppressed squeal, her smile blatant and not one bit shy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi nodded, taking the information in as she stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was farmilar with chicken noodle soup. It was part of the methods she tried when she and George had at first wanted a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing had worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some people had said it just wasn&#39;t the right time, some said it was because they weren&#39;t mates, that fate was against their union. George had told her that she was more than enough and he was the happiest that they both had Mira. George could have a child, the tests showed that she was the one with the problem, but anytime anyone asked, George had always said he was the problem while he blamed his semen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poor thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mira had been too young to understand anything, but her presence had been really helpful, also she never asked to have a younger sibling. As for her mum, Aunt Mira, she stood by her like an unshakable pillar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Zezi had finally given up, she had all the support she needed and from then on, she had never thought of being pregnant again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, until now that Gwen was saying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should be mad at Gwen for what she was doing, but strangely, she wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze landed on the plate that Gwen still held to her and she took it from her, putting it right back on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thank you. I don&#39;t want your King putting some blood sucking strangers in my belly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen frowned before she understood and crackled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gwen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Milady. My lips are now sealed on the matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; She said, turning away as Gwen continued talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should meet my bats, Milady. You should see how lovely they are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi tsked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen was relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for the invite, I might consider it in future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when it hit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had forgotten that she was supposed to keep her distance from Gwen so that it wouldn&#39;t affect her mission, by making her see the vampires in a different light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But was that really needed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she really need to keep her distance and be cold to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen had done nothing wrong, in fact, she might.... like her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her revenge should be focused on those who had done something to her, those who were powerful enough to make the big changes, those who deserved the big falls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like the Royals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King especially.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His death would sooth her pain and her grievance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you like to meet them today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;ll be busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi didn&#39;t spare her one more moment of chitchat. She went into the bathroom and came out minutes after, refreshed, then after some minutes, dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Gwen wasn&#39;t talking about her having kids again, she was cleaning the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t even rough but it seemed Gwen enjoyed picking up things and putting them right back with a little touch here and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was something in her little routine book, that she had to check out. Zezi never said anything about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plate of chicken noodle soup was no longer on the table, there was another meal there instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen was a sweetheart, if she kept on with this, being indifferent with her won&#39;t be so easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi had eaten halfway when Gwen&#39;s confused voice drawn her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady, are these yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi bit her tongue at what she saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There in Gwen&#39;s hands were envelopes and the letters that Akeem had sent to her.</p>
