                <p>There had been no attack happening in Mira&#39;s room. However, something strange had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice had seen Mira&#39;s father, George, clawing himself and saying defaming words to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was blaming himself for something and it didn&#39;t take Lady Delice any difficulty to understand that he and his beast were probably not in agreement on a very serious matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never witnessed something like that before even when she used to be part of a pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was very strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she was able to restrain him and for that spilt moment when she had him pinned to the wall, something had flashed in her mind, something that reminded her of this mask she had in her hands right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a brown mask, with deep green floral designs around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after she had ensured that he was in control of himself and she had ensured that Mira was alright, Lady Delice had left the room quite unstable. She had ran into her room and turned her boxes upside down to find this mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t make sense for her to be reminded of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was something that had happened so long ago that she had forgotten all about it. Besides, she was certain that the wolf had no connection to that event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could still remember the bed, the blood on the mask, and the altered scent, but that was all. She couldn&#39;t remember anything more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory was so blurry, she just couldn&#39;t remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, this made no sense!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was just no way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certainly overthinking this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming to that conclusion, she had tossed the mask aside and picked up a sachet of blood, drinking from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first news Zezi got when she woke up was from happy Gwen, who was overjoyed by the fact that her Mistress was back in the chambers that she and the King shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your daughter is awake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a wonderful news. So wonderful that Zezi didn&#39;t have time to express how happy she was to see Gwen again in good health or her worry about where Valerick had gone and if their enmity was back at it again after the night they had shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that was for later!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran down the stairs and faster than she had expected, she was in her daughter&#39;s room. Besides the physicians, there were others there already. George, Aunt Alice, Lady Delice, and soon enough, Valerick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the fact that they had both agreed to choosing sides in the morning, Zezi had been so relieved and happy to see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He effortlessly slid to her, trying to push as much concern and happiness into his face as much as he could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Heartbeat would love him more if he loved her people. He would start learning to do that from now on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she alright?&#34; Zezi asked, moving around the bed and checking her daughter whose eyes she could finally see open after all these days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was barely up to a week but honestly, it felt like forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is alright now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Happiness consumed the room, a different emotion from the one that had been holding the castle hostage for a while now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mira was so glad to see her parents again and the embraces were unending. She was happy to see Lady Delice and was extremely grateful after being told that she saved her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The &#34;thank you, Lady Delice&#34; were unending too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that moment, there was peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until something happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was time to draw blood for some tests, Mira had touched one of the physicians during her protest of not wanting the needle. He had staggered back, looking around blankly for a second before slipping to the ground, unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi had frowned and her eyes found George who was already looking at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly the physician was taken away and everyone was made to stay out of touchable distance from Mira. George was stubborn, he didn&#39;t want to move, scared that they wanted to do something to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was stubborn too, having the same fear as George. Valerick tried to get her away, protective of her, while assuring her that he wouldn&#39;t let any harm come to her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t hold his word for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They did both agreed to choosing sides in the morning. If they were to come to the conclusion that Mira was dangerous to his kind, he would easily pick his people over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So stubbornly by her daughter&#39;s side, she remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, Nicholas was back from attending to the fallen physician.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is awake.&#34; He had declared, reassuring Mira that she hadn&#39;t killed the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl had smiled happily before Nicholas had pulled the room aside to speak to them about what was really going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is awake but he can&#39;t remember anything that happened today. He is kind of spaced out. Does this happen with you guys? Do you have this ability to make peoples&#39; memories fade away?&#34; Nicholas&#39;s gaze moved from Zezi to George and then to Aunt Alice, his questions directed to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of &#34;memories fade away&#34;, Lady Delice tensed up, but no one noticed that. No one was paying enough attention to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Generally?&#34; It was Zezi who asked. &#34;Do you want to know if it is a werewolf thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; George answered, &#34;It is a very rare ability.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You possess the ability?&#34; Nicholas threw in a wild guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George&#39;s shoulder tensed up. The vampires didn&#39;t know about this before and he didn&#39;t want them knowing any more about him than they already did. That would make them more desperate to acquire him as an instrument of war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would rather die than fight on their side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything for his daughter, right? Even his safety and life-long conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it is a genetic thing. We will still have to perf---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira is adopted.&#34; Belladonna cleared that up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm,&#34; Nicholas hummed, smoothening his hands against his scrubs. &#34;We will have to run some tests on you George. You both have this ability.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you think she is from my lineage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, this will help us in finding out what kind of hybrid she is. Also, she might be from your lineage. There can even be a slight chance, you might be her father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More tension but this time George was ignorant of its growing nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am her father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her biological father, I mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something shifted in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing can be confirmed until the test is performed, of course,&#34; Nicholas said, as he departed from them. &#34;So, we just have to wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words weren&#39;t as comforting as he had intended them.</p>
