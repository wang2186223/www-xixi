                <p>The dance finally came to an end, and as Valerick led them away from the dancefloor, Zezi peered over her shoulder, her gaze fixed on the door of the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They still weren&#39;t here yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Basit and Riza,&#34; Valerick said as they approached the couple and Zezi&#39;s heart skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, he knew them. They had been part of his father&#39;s army.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were not Volakys though, the former King hadn&#39;t turned them into that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One wonders why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bowed lightly, showing their respect. They hadn&#39;t changed so much since the last time she had seen them, which was expected. Although, instead of Riza allowing her long white hair to flow behind her, she had it braided, so it wasn&#39;t sweeping the floor like it had been the night they had met. Basit still kept his full white beard that shrouded his face in mystery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were dressed in black, a sharp contrast to the color that went along with this type of occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is good to see you both, thank you for coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just having a normal conversation, she shouldn&#39;t be finding this hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With light pressure, her grip tightened around his arm that she was hanging on to, and her hard gaze shifted to the guests in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their presence here wasn&#39;t good, she could just feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are the ones that should be grateful, and we are. Sparing our souls despite being part of your Father&#39;s army, Your Majesty, is something we will forever be grateful for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you are truly grateful?&#34; Valerick smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stared back at him, clearly taken aback by what he had said. Their gazes shifted to the fur creature, then back to their King. It was so fast, that it could have gone unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick had noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled his hand away from Zezi&#39;s grip and slipped it around her waist instead, holding her to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assumed you&#39;d be mad at me for stripping you of your titles. In fact, I thought you had been planning little revolutions against me, since you both have made your appearance very scarce lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vampires went pale in that instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Zezi, it was hard to remain calm, to not panic. She leaned into him, resting her head against his chest, breathing him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That helped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made her panic and made her calm at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never. Your Majesty.&#34; Basit declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever rumours---&#34; Riza started to say but Valerick tilted his head, and she kept her mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. Silly thoughts, right?&#34; Valerick chuckled, the sound rumbling through his chest, against Zezi&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dashing out threats and all that made her feel, was hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, she had definitely hit her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, she had better not be getting addicted already. This was bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vampires had joined in the laughter and she had smiled, but she couldn&#39;t help but worry if Valerick suspected Riza and Basit because of the position they held in his father&#39;s army before, or if he knew about the White Circle-- if he knew about her involvement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About the poison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basit and Riza left after a couple of tensed humour which Valerick appeared to have enjoyed very much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he had led her to a food stand, where different steaks, cakes, and sweet food were on display. They were all covered and there were about four guards, guarding the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Precautions, good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your stomach rumbled twice times, eat up, while I attend to something. Also, you&#39;ll need strength for a little something I just learnt.&#34; He winked and before she could even blink, he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to the table, picked up a slice of chocolate cake, and ate it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you even eat those things?&#34; Nicholas said behind her, holding a glass of win--blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to be everywhere tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she would have to go through the torture of enduring his presence though, Gwen came for her and was hurrying her across the hall to meet her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked absolutely gorgeous in that blue floral dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My bats are dying to see you. My husband too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her family had been sitting at a table far from the dance floor. Gwen&#39;s husband looked really happy to see her. A buff and tall man in a pair of blue suit, with the most heartwarming smile that she could only ever link to Gwen having in her possession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty, Zyon.&#34; he greeted, as he stood up from his seat and took a step forward with a noticeable limp, bowing slightly in respect. &#34;My wife has told me a lot of good things about you. It is a pleasure to finally meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen chuckled, rushing over to her husband&#39;s side, moving her hand over his tie, and adjusting his collar even though none of those needed to be fixed. He smiled down at her and she blushed in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow, they were so happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made her wonder, for a split moment, if she could be this happy too... with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So stupid. So delusional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is my pleasure to finally meet you too, Zyon. Gwen has been the absolute best and I&#39;m happy to meet the person that keeps her happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed. &#34;She keeps me happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen&#39;s blush deepened and she patted his chest, &#34;Stop it, I&#39;m shy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, and Zezi smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah. So happy. Something about seeing them this happy, made her heart heavy with &#34;maybes&#34; and &#34;maybe nots&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Zezi met her children - her eight bats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eldest looked like he was eight. It was like she popped out a baby every year, her youngest might be around two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being with Gwen&#39;s family was wonderful and time went by quickly talking to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen&#39;s children had brought her a wedding gift - a book, one they wrote themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, yes. Another to add to her collection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi had received it with a smile and promised to read it to the last page once the Joining Ceremony was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, the kids had to be taken home and Zyon kissed Gwen goodnight, as he rallied up the kids in his arms and took them out of the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have brought the rest of the supporters here but the invitation was really limited. Surely some other time, My Queen.&#34; Gwen said, not taking her eyes off the door her husband had just disappeared into merely some seconds ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed. &#34;Sorry, milady, but I have to kiss my mate again. If you&#39;ll excuse me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sprinted towards the door and this time around, Zezi couldn&#39;t keep herself from chuckling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Moon, they were perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each day, the vampires seemed to her to be less and less of a monster. It shook the core of what she believed in, but the death of her kind, stood firmly in her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were monsters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for Gwen and her family, certainly, she could make an exception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should go back to the cake, she needed to taste something sweet and Valerick wasn&#39;t here yet to offer her his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head vigorously, like she could shake the thought off and the reasons for it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not just think that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then something caught her attention, Oliver had left the hall without Laura, who appeared to be dancing with someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, there was nothing suspicious about that. It was normal for him to be mad if his &#34;Raaa Queen&#34; was waltzing away with another vampire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poor &#34;Oli baby&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi cringed at the nicknames they used for themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, Basit and Riza had left shortly after too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, did they just go after Oliver?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were definitely going to meet up outside!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why? What was going on between the trio? What did they plan to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, enough with the questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time to find out.</p>
