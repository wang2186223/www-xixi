                <p>Had she forgotten to drop the curtains again? Or was it Gwen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved a little in bed, but her body ached slightly from that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the scent that engulfed her nose the next second, made her eyes go wide open. She looked around, taking in the room she had found herself in, noticing how different it was from the designed prison she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then slowly, her gaze moved to the floor, where all the dresses she had worn last night, were scattered all over, like they had been pulled off in haste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart dropped with a thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It mustn&#39;t be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart was hammering loudly in her ears, her mind thinking fast, as she tried to remember what she had done last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door of what must be the bathroom creaked open, not giving her enough time to come up with an explanation for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waking up in a strange room was no horror compared to looking at the person in front of her and realizing whose room this was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands clamped right around her blanket, as she sat up, discovering that she was completely naked beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes looked a little tired, his hair messy, and all those bites that littered his neck and chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hickeys?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were those hers?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We...&#34; she started before she could even stop herself. &#34;Did we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He arched her an eyebrow, taking a step further like he was going to ask her how she was feeling, but stopped, picking up something from the floor with a quizzical gaze, before assessing it for better viewing in order to see what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A black lace high-cut brief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s gasped lowly, her gaze fixed on the small piece of clothing dangling from his hand, her legs folding across each other, her nakedness now being brought more to her awareness by what she had seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who else&#39;s would it be?&#34; He dropped his hand by his side, walking to the left side of the bed, her gaze following him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still hadn&#39;t answered yet and the fact that she couldn&#39;t remember anything yet, wasn&#39;t making this any better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made her feel absolutely unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did we...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; He said, dropping the brief by her side on the bed, and she snatched it away before he even let it go completely, her hand almost hitting his as a result.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting his fists on the bed, bringing his face to her line of sight, he continued and she turned her face away, staring right ahead, trying with everything she had in her to ignore how close he was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You came to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip tightened around the sheet in her hand, hugging it closer to her chest. Her eyelids fell shut, her eyebrows creased into a frown, the memory of every word he said, playing in her head like some evidence to back up his speech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tasted your body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered the flick of his tongue on her neck, how he planted hickeys that would definitely show this morning... and how she had begged for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You tasted mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory flashed before her eyes, how she had kissed the base of his neck, moved down to his chest, tasting him like her life depended on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The need she had felt unexplainable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart raced and she was starting to fear what more she would remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We laid in the same bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he had placed her on the bed, how she had ripped his shirt to shreds, begging that he wouldn&#39;t move away from her, consumed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had possessed her to do all that?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her other hand tightened on the sheet to her right, and she prayed that he wouldn&#39;t go on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that once this banging headache was gone and after some moments, she would remember it all but right now, she didn&#39;t think she was strong enough to remember how she had fully given herself to this monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All on her own, she had come to his door and begged that he take her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only that caused her heart to be heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that was as far as we went.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flew open and she turned to him, unfiltered shock in her blue orbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to say something but words deserted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you wouldn&#39;t want it to happen, so I didn&#39;t let it.&#34; He eased off the bed, standing straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi blinked, looking away, hearing the bed squish as he eased off it and stepped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered it all now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had left her on the bed, as she dozed off, after taking off all her dresses except and left one. Then he had stayed by the door. She had woken up after that though, and that was when she had stripped herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heavy words slipped through her lips in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, his hand brushing through his hair, his gaze intense, then his face lit with a light smile and he shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a gentleman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, what was she supposed to say to that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, what was the reasonable thing to say to a man whom you found yourself naked in his bed when you shouldn&#39;t be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes glinted at the notice of something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your hair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s quite long. Didn&#39;t know it was shoulder length.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged again. &#34;Because you never really paid me any attention. Crossed me out before even giving me a chance, but from on, I feel I&#39;ll be having your eyes on me a lot.&#34; His eyes narrowed, his gaze intense. &#39;I&#39;ll be sure to enjoy it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned, annoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she blame him, the mate bond was giving him so much audacity!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like to get dressed and get out of your room now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering the number of dresses and chains she had to put herself in last night, and knowing that he had been the one to take them all off, made blood rush up to her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s alright. Just pick one from the floor. I was very careful not to rip any.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was as firm as usual and didn&#39;t sound like he was suggesting anything but still, she couldn&#39;t help the anger she felt at the pit of her stomach because of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was that supposed to mean? That he had more control just because she had ripped his shirt while she was in heat?</p>
