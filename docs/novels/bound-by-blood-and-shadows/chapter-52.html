                <p>Gwen paced around the alleyway of the castle, her eyes furrowed with worry, while her mind tumbled with many thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had heard about how the dinner had gone and she knew it hadn&#39;t gone any better. The King had not summoned her but she was waiting for her certain doom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew it would come and when she finally got summoned this time, that would be the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so deep in thought that she didn&#39;t know when someone walked down the hallway and stood behind her, until the person called her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha! Lady Delice!&#34; She asked, placing a hand on her chest. &#34;You scared me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen shook her head, holding Lady Delice&#39;s hand, her lips slightly trembling, her eyes welling up with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Lady Delice,&#34; she cried, resting in Lady Delice&#39;s arms that willingly went around her. &#34;I&#39;m doomed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen was quick to tell Lady Delice about her predicament, her fears, and her dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...all I am waiting for now is to lose my soul. I just hope my family will not suffer for this.&#34; She ended, sniffling. Somewhere along the line, she had started crying, and now she was a complete mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will not lose your soul and no harm will come upon your family.&#34; Lady Delice offered with her ever-warm smile, a silent promise in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen blinked, thinking about what could possibly avoid her woes before she gave a shadow of a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really appreciate your offer but I&#39;m afraid a plea will not be enough for this. Even if it comes from you, but maybe--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There will be no need for the plea. Listen to me, this is what you&#39;ll do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen frowned, blinking again and ready to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice was wise and her advice always worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When next the King summons you, you must stay strong and state the power of the bond, inevitably drawing them close. The King loves facts and knowing that you know what you are saying will make him allow you to press forward with the rest of your point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, he also believes in fate. Tell him that the bond will certainly pull them together at the fated time.&#34; Her hand brushed lightly over a side of Gwen&#39;s face. &#34;No one can rush destiny, it happens at its own pace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen nodded, her face still creased into a frown, only her eyes weren&#39;t so filled with worry anymore. &#34;And my advice for him to be more kind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is necessary that he continues, a mind does not change in a day, it&#39;s a long process. When the fated time comes, being more kind helps it flow easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen pulled Delice into a quick embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, Lady Delice. My heart no longer feels burdened. You are an absolute blessing.&#34; She wept in appreciation for a while, and Delice giggled before Gwen frowned once again, feeling concerned all of a sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled away, looking at her ever-sweet Lady Delice&#39;s face; the Royal Adviser known to never do wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she bear it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she surviving all this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was her sweet Lady faring?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it not hurt you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Delice&#39;s smile deepened by the corners, her eyes filled with oblivion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doing this.&#34; Lady Delice&#39;s oblivion about what she was asking was still present in her eyes, and Gwen added for further explanation. &#34;You love his Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile broadened with understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it will be, Gwen. It will be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen&#39;s voice softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one has a heart purer than you, Lady Delice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You flatter me, I believe I&#39;m not a spotless saint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled, hiding her smile behind a dismissive hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen paused, finally observing her long gown, and her boots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What has you dressed up like this tonight? Heading somewhere, Lady Delice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I was returning when I saw you,&#34; she squinted her eyes at her. &#34;You look tired, you should be in your home right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I was dismissed for the night but I wanted to wait and see how the dinner would go.&#34; She rested her hands on her waist, with a tired sigh. &#34;Now I wished I had just gone home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice took her hand, heading out of the alley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Milady, I don&#39;t want to impose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please, Gwen. We are family.&#34; She said, heading towards the front of the palace where her carriage was. &#34;Ride with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Lady Delice&#39;s Carriage, they got to Gwen&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her kids poured out like beans in a sack, all of them, running all over their mother from out of the small door of the house by the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With smiles, she pulled them in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids were used to seeing Lady Delice too and they raced into her open arms too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunty!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delice! Delice! Delice!&#34; Some of them sang, clapping their hands, while they went around her, the tallest of them with a height just slightly above her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, children. It is Lady Delice. Don&#39;t be rude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get them inside.&#34; Her son, the eldest, offered, bowing in respect and greeting to Lady Delice again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please, don&#39;t. I enjoy their company.&#34; Her hands patted the three-year-old boy in her arms. &#34;I have gifts for everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yay! Delice! Delice! Delice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Delice!&#34; Their mother corrected them. Some immediately accepted the correction, some did along the line, while the others just continued, making the chant a mixture of &#34;Delice!&#34; and &#34;Lady Delice!&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her children were always a bundle of joy and Delice enjoyed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there was her husband, who came out, greeted Lady Delice, and welcomed his wife, telling her that he had to sneak away from their youngest who was asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a reluctant goodbye, the gifting of a bundle of toys that Lady Delice had stopped her carriage along the road to get, and a small package for the eldest son, Lady Delice returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she got back to the palace, she headed up to her room and up the stairs, blinking away the tears that kept building up in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice seeped into her ears echoing in the hallway, she didn&#39;t attempt to listen and allow the echoing to become an echoing nonsense in her ears, but she heard the ending of the conversation as her eyes met with Laura&#39;s, who quickly rushed up the call to an end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That stunned her to a spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love you too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was Laura talking to?</p>
