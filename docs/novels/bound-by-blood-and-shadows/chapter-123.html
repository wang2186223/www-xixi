                <p>Before Delice saw the mark, she had already caught on to the scent since Lady Zezi came into the hallway and her head hug slightly in submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An action she had done instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze shifted when Zezi grabbed her hand with urgency, and ushered them into her room that she had just been coming out from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He knows I am weak. He told the Physician to look at me while I was passed out. He will find out everything. Tell me you have a solution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words poured out of her mouth the moment they were in Lady Delice&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bare his mark.&#34; She sounded like she was in a daze, her hand reaching up slowly to the bite marks that had more significance in them than meets the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, she had wanted those to design her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although, for a while now, she had been able to convince herself that she didn&#39;t want that anymore, but that surge that she had always felt stirred through her again, and although she fought hard to suppress it, jealousy tasted bitter on her tongue, till she shoved it away and reminded herself that the best way to love him was what she was already doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, saving him from a darkness that was threatening to consume him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many had said that her emotions were affected because he was her Sire, that what she felt for him stemmed from the fact that he had turned her when they were both too young and she had been the first creature he had turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been too raw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Control had been found lacking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was too crude and had led to a messy result.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You reek of the king,&#34; she bowed slightly again, then raised her gaze of concern to her promised future Queen. &#34;This is not good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s nose flared, angry that her Mate&#39;s claim on her was receiving a negative comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you even hear anything that I have just said, Lady Deli---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you done it yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew what she meant and she shifted from one foot to another uncomfortably, looking at the dully painted room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shades sparked no life and Zezi wondered if that had anything to do with the loss of her child. That thought made her think of her daughter and she pulled her arms around her, missing the feeling of those tiny hands that should be there instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She missed her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although, she had to admit, what she used to feel for George was gone. Now, she just cared about him, nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would have loved to hold the bond responsible, but she had come too far to know that, that wasn&#39;t really something the bond could control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all her emotions at work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were messing with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice&#39;s sigh of relief could be heard from across the room, although it was very silent. Her super-enhanced hearing, is one of the advantages of allowing him to mark her. It was only a little enhanced than normal though, if the bond is completed, she would have more perks. Be healed faster and have less reaction to silver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the bonding, the mates would usually share their strengths and be stronger together, but her wolf was weaker compared to the vampire and all her wolf was doing right now was taking from him, she wasn&#39;t really giving him anything back through the bond, except filling all where she was lacking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to the bond, their relationship felt parasitical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still not good.&#34; Lady Delice managed a calming smile but Zezi knew her more than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how she wanted to fight it, she had come to know her more than just the surface within these past months, know her to the point that they almost felt like friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The fact that he had the Physician look at me? Yes, Lady Delice. It is obvious that it is bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The King did that?!&#34; Her voice caved into shock and her eyes widened slightly before she moved quickly to her dressing table and gulped down something in the goblet that had been placed on it a while ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slight metallic whiff in the air made it obvious that the liquid was blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unnerving to watch her move so quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an unusual sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The physician is very good. He will detect the poison in your veins, Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi nodded. &#34;Well, the Princess said--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She meant only if you were not checked through any medical process, pardon my intrusion.&#34; She added when she caught the glare that knitted slowly on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine.&#34; Zezi shrugged, leaning casually against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t find a way to dismiss Gwen and go through the trouble of promising to wear her gift, while avoiding a bloodoath on that with a lot of stress, only to come here and argue about her interrupting her speech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was everything making her angry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wolf must be shifting into her new position as Queen. Her animalistic side ready to take on nature&#39;s natural demands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Moon, this would be difficulty to juggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The King mustn&#39;t see the test result. You have to prevent it by all means necessary, Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she will have to be the one to do the work and here she was, thinking there would be an easier way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi shrugged it off, moving on to the next thing. She had met the Physical before coming here, the test result was not out yet and it would take a couple of hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, the moon was on her side.  She didn&#39;t have time for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were worried about another thing?&#34; Zezi urged her to speak and Lady Delice nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I get you anything? Tea? Water?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t stall, Lady Delice. Tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded gently, and the aura became unnerving calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were hoping that you would be able to carry out the mission without following your instincts regarding him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We, the White Circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Him, her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instincts, marking and mating him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was that even possible?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the way she had found to feed the poison was him licking it off her, how would the risk of that happening not be one that was calculated?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had calculated the risk though, her calculations had just been off, that was all. She had deceived herself into believing that she would still be able to be in control despite everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she knew that was nothing but a big lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice&#39;s eyes danced with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is an elimination, Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is your mate.&#34; She emphasized the word &#39;mate&#39; and Zezi nodded, understanding what she was implying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still remembered when some of their capital members had died at the battle, some of their mates in the pack had died, while the others had been thrown into eternal depression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Valerick was to die, she would suffer the same fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was banking on eternal depression though. She would rather be alive than dead. If she was alive, they could, by some miracle, find a remedy for her situation, even if that had never been done before. Still, if she was dead, that would be the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will die, Lady Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is not certain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, it is. The King is a soul seizer. His soul is greatly lacking, there is a void that refused to be filled within him before and now that he has marked you, you&#39;ve filled his void to a great extent. You are way too connected to not die when he does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi took in a shaky breath and looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Laura warned me not to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I believe you deserve to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I already knew. I was just in denial. How about you just kill me then? Saves us all the stress, don&#39;t you think, Lady Delice?&#34;</p>
