                <p>Her eyelids were heavy, and they were slipping close fast; she felt herself being lifted in his arms, all the fight in her quickly seeping right out of her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because he was holding her but simply because she no longer had any fight in her.</p>

                <p>She could feel him breeze out of the dungeon; she couldn&#39;t smell the anguish nor hear the voice of her family that she was now scared of not hearing anymore, now more than ever.</p>

                <p>Zezi felt like she had missed some parts of the conversation. She was constantly falling into deep sleep, struggling, then losing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly felt liquid drop to her lips and rolled on her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t taste nor process what it was. The silver she had used on herself was numbing all her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever it was, she gulped it down quickly. It was only a few drops, and somehow, she seemed to want more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her body was relaxing and she found herself finally losing the battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had to stay awake!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would become of her family if she slept?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to stay--</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You smell like ivy,&#34; a raspy voice said above her. She felt a cold palm pressed to a side of her cheek which quickly turned warm, then a forehead pressed against hers. &#34;I love ivies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, she felt a cold tongue against her neck, licking the open cut of the dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had gone deeper than she wanted it to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a shaky breath at the sensation of him and her skin sealing up, her body turning down every other command to jerk away from him. It was like she was an immovable lump of flesh and bones. Her mark burned hot against her skin, anytime his tongue came in contact with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep.&#34; He whispered before pulling away and that was all she remembered before falling right into the firm arms of darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>BloodSuckers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Filthy, dirty, cruel, bloodsuckers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shouldn&#39;t have existed to begin with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George&#39;s anger was plain for all to see but just as much as they could all see it under the gentle light of the moon that was glowing down on them, they knew it was useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been brought out here for a trial and they knew that none of those ever brought out for a trial before the King lived after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This trial would have usually occurred in the King&#39;s court, but why would they do that when every one of them would certainly end up being executed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This simply made things easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George had heard a lot about this place from the guards that had brought him here; with the little time they had, they had given him enough information about their so-called &#34;justice system&#34;.  Not out of pity, nor fully out of hate but because they simply found him to be of low rank and useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no idea how he would be executed, but he was not worried about him; he was worried about his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he hadn&#39;t brought her along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did this to them. If only he had planned better. If only he had noticed that the cave was spelled. If only his annoying wolf hadn&#39;t taken over. If only.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wolf was agitated in his mind and didn&#39;t attempt to start an argument to push the blame away. Although, he chipped in that if only he hadn&#39;t clung on to a mate that wasn&#39;t his, they wouldn&#39;t be in this mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George pulled Mira closer; she was shivering in his arms from cold and hunger. They were on the podium for all to see, the bloodthirsty creatures&#39; eyes twinkling with absolute delight like they were some clown put on the stage for a show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their misery was something of a great pleasure to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hated them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had always been destructive, that was how they were. Trying to save Zezi from these creatures had been the right thing to do, he only regretted that he had brought Mira along and the fact that his escape plan was a failure. The results, not the action. Never the action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You stupid pathetic being.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wolf snapped at him but he ignored, just as much as he had always ignored it when it came to matters concerning Zezi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, he could hear boots approaching the podium in determined steps and everywhere went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only one person could command such respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader of all these evil creatures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His claws poked out slowly, but he quickly controlled himself because of the child in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, his rage was like a burning ember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a delight it would be to rip him apart and toss his severed head across the field like a ball.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The BloodSuckers&#39; King sat on his throne, his crown firm on his head as he eyed them with coldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he gave a short note, announcing to the crowd their &#34;crimes&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George did not pay it any attention until he felt all attention on him again and heard, &#34;You may plead your case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, he started to plead his case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew that no matter his plea, nothing would change, the King certainly wanted him dead. But he had to do something more for Mira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he would have mercy on her considering that she was a child... his mate&#39;s child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought soured his heart and he ignored his wolf&#39;s cheering at his admission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although, from what he had done to them already, that was greatly unlikely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway, George hoped for otherwise. As long as his so-called mercy wasn&#39;t the option of turning her into one of them instead of letting her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he would rather kill her in his arms, before they would make her into a monster like them for the rest of her very long life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing was worse than being that creature that sucked blood.</p>
