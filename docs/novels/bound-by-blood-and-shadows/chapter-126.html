                <p>That was a useless thing though, if Iriysi was a pure-blood like her brother and an old vampire too, her hearing would be very good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze flew across the study where Irysi was now sitting on the sofa at one end, her eyes trained on the laptop on her laps and ear plugs buried into her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They must use a lot of technological products in the Right Province. She seemed to be in her element as her fingers punched the keys on the laptop&#39;s keyboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow, she was being polite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great, another well-mannered vampire. As if she didn&#39;t already have Delice and Gwen to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was pushed open and the physician moved in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him made Zezi angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bringer of doom, how do you do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Princess is not well, permit me to attend to her immediately. It is a matter of utmost urgency.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is wrong with Laura?&#34; He said, letting Zezi go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only then that Zezi realized that Lady Delice had also made it into the study. She must have greeted them when she came in but Zezi couldn&#39;t remember. Her heart was pounding while her gaze zeroed in on the report in the physician&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time for the meeting, and the Physician had brought in the medical report, she still hadn&#39;t given Valerick her offer yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was all a tangled mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the moon, why was she never lucky?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think everything will be fine once he leaves to see her, your Majesty.&#34; Lady Delice chipped in and Valerick nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This meeting will be adjourned. I need a couple of minutes to ensure my sister is okay. Give the report to the Royal Adviser and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Physician obeyed, passing the report to Lady Delice before he bolted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, they all started leaving the study. Lady Delice dropped off the report on the King&#39;s table while he spoke to Iriysi about the abrupt change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have stuck those eye plugs in too deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lady Delice left though, she mouthed two words to Zezi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take It.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi nodded, grabbing the report and breezing out of the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard the door shut firmly behind her though and before she made it too far, she felt a hand pulling her towards a body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stolen the report, I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart must have dropped down all the floors of the castle, before making it back into her chest at that truthful accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What now?&#34; She asked, breathlessly. &#34;You read minds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It hurts that you confide in my Royal Adviser more than you do in me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi bit her lower lips, realizing that he must have seen when Lady Delice was mouthing the words to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand clutched the report behind her, and she rolled her eyes in an attempt to play it cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that even possible any longer?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had ticked every single box in making something suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt stupid for pulling such a dumb move. She was a General, a whole Zeta. What kind of poor planning and execution was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt blood turn to fire in her veins the moment she realized her back had been pressed firmly against the wall, her knuckles scratching the brick wall behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pleasure that surged through her was more than the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what? Keep it till you are ready to share.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed his thumb over her lips, her hands being in hostage, there was little she could do to stop him from pressing himself totally to her, and shoving a leg inbetween her thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intrusion was a welcome presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no denying that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There will be a price to pay for my patience though.&#34; He whispered, his voice thick with need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gulped, looked up at him, at those eyes that were turning increasingly black, those veins spotting themselves slowly beneath his brown skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What price.&#34; Her voice was breathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll let you know when I decide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi shut her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having sex in the hallway wasn&#39;t something she had on her to-do list, yet why was that thought so tempting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to tell him about her offer already, tell him all about the White Circle, and win some security for her people, but she couldn&#39;t find the words to put together to form a coherent sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This male was too distracting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you have your sister to get to or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, the sound morphing into her neck, sinking into the pores of her skin, making her arch her body into him before pulling away immediately, fighting to remain in control of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would not let that happen till she at least told him her offer and he accepts it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is fine. I know this is all a big ploy to make sure you get the report. I kind of like that you are finally getting along with Laura,&#34; his tongue swiped along her ear lobe and she clenched the report in her hand even more, losing strength in her legs, as she moved down slowly, then fighting hard to remain on her feet when she realized that if she continued to fall down this slope, she would be left with no choice but to rut against Valerick&#39;s leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As horny as she was, getting it in the hallway was definitely not on her to-do list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was free from this, she would go into her room and touch herself. It&#39;s been so long, maybe having that out of the way would help her think straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You three are like the three musketeers, and here I am, the poor victim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valerick---&#34; it was a gasp, it was a plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was begging him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His play at seduction had almost snapped, hearing her say his name like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His plan was to seduce her and he had been doing that, it was an idea from one of his books, so that they could mate already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to have her and yet, not have her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she, and not her wolf this time, would just ask, he would take her. Getting back to the study would not be hard, and making it to his room wouldn&#39;t be a hassle either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she would just command him, he would obey, without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, I must see Laura.&#34; He pulled slightly away from her and she almost cried at the coldness of his absence. Consoling herself with the promise that she would touch herself after this, touch herself to the smell of him that had rubbed now into her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just hoped he wouldn&#39;t walk in on her, since they now shared the same bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, farewell shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So happy thinking of me,&#34; he pinched her nose playfully, &#34;my horny mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horny mate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cocky bastard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did he even get that way?</p>
