                <p>The first three words she heard after she opened her eyes. Valerick was sitting by her side and staring down at her like she was a piece of art that was threatening to crumble at any second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed turning away to get some sleep. What was he doing in her room? Why was he waking her up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The aura that pushed itself into her lungs as she moved within the sheets, made her body tingle, worry rushed into her and consumed her mind but she was not worried, why was she feeling---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot up from bed, holding the sheets to her body as the memory of yesterday rushed through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart thundered and she fixed Valerick a scrutinizing gaze, one that zeroed in quickly on his neck to confirm if her memory was real or it had been tampered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gulped when she caught the sight of the mark that he was making no attempt to hide, and her inside recoiled in the realization that for the first time, her wolf had made a big step that she hadn&#39;t consented to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wolf had marked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed his hand over the mark, feeling a little nervous at her scrutinizing and her overwhelming emotions hitting him like a trainwreck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened up, closing her eyes briefly from the sensation that crossed through her at his action. A shaky breath let itself slip past her lips and she started attempting to get off the bed when she realized that this wasn&#39;t her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blue color was calming and very familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, by the Moon, what else had her wolf done with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she knew was that she had gone to the office to ask him some questions and her wolf had pulled her back, and kept her in the back of her mind. She could remember wavering in, but her emotions were consumed by her wolf&#39;s own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or were they hers?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, everything was so confusing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had her wolf marked him when she was still contemplating her next step? When she wasn&#39;t even sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wolf had never done that before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt strange and she felt that there would have been a very good reason for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hands that came on her bare shoulders were warm and she relaxed into his touch before she could even stop herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he was leading her to the bed, and she was gasping and curling her toes, from how overwhelming her desire hit her. It didn&#39;t take her long to discover that the emotions sweeping in her just weren&#39;t her own, but Valerick&#39;s own too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This mark had just connected them in a way that was going to affect everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What about her plans with the White Circle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You passed out.&#34; He said again and pulled away like her skin was lava. Definitely to fight down his own desire to take her at that very moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mate bond hadn&#39;t been completed yet and until that would happen, their emotions would be highly heightened in an unbalanced way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That shouldn&#39;t have happened but it appeared your body was weak from some kind of illness.&#34; He said, settling down next to her, simply because he couldn&#39;t find the strength to pull away for too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been worried right from the time it had happened. How her body had gone limp in his hand, the fear that had rushed through him, and his sleepless night that had been filled with nothing but dreadful worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she sick?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Werewolves were hardly sick but could it be a terminal illness she was hiding from him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that was the situation, he might have to turn her, and he would have to make her see the reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had just started making progress with her, why should he lose her so soon when they were supposed to have a lifetime together?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched her as she folded her arms protectively around her at the word &#34;illness&#34; and his dead heart sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Blood, no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi bit her lower lip, trying hard not to react to any of this, as she put all her effort into blocking the emotional link between them. Having a fated mate was so much different than having a chosen one, this experience was all so new to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About her passing out, was it the effect of the poison?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Delice not said it would completely leave her system?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would have to ask her and Laura about this later, since the Physician had not been involved in checking her, then she could relax for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a wonder that Valerick hadn&#39;t gotten the Physician to do that but that must just mean that luck was really on her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she observed that she had his shirt on instead of the gown she had worn to his office yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understandable, since shifting into her wolf, had torn her cloth into shreds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She liked the feel of the soft fabric against her skin and Valerick&#39;s aura that hung onto it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crossed her face at her undeniable pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might not have been in on the marking, but a big part of her was certainly pleased, while the other small part was confused, but there was no anger and as much as wanted to convince herself that there was, there was no regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I had the Physician check you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her widen eyes moved to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You what?!&#34; She croaked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the Physician had checked her, and the poison was still lingering in her veins then he would be able to find that out. The results would be delivered to Valerick and he would find out everything about the poison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be easy for him to put two and two together and find out that she was after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole act of pretending that it was a pregnancy medicine from Gwen would quickly be realized to be just that, an act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was doom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was doomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was every day getting more complicated than the day before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was nothing going as planned?</p>
