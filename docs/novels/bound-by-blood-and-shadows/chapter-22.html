                <p>All around them were vampires, their eyes seemed to be in a crazy daze, their fangs peeking out from the corners of their red lips, their robes no longer on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura swung around the branch of the tall tree she had been sitting on, landing neatly on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you so bold, kissing another on my brother&#39;s territory?&#34; Her eyes glimmered with a deep shade of mischief, one that stood ever so obvious and couldn&#39;t be mistaken for otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are out of the cave, let us go!&#34; Zezi tried to move in front of her family for protection, spreading her hands to her side, but George took the move, stepping in front of her and spreading his hands sideways, sending them a threatening growl, his wolf at the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering what had happened in the cave earlier and how close she had been to dying, sensing that his wolf was coming to the surface gave her no ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason his wolf would be willing to fight was because George and Mira were in danger, too, right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a pathetic sight. Isn&#39;t this just funny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no laughter from her lifeless army and she snapped her gaze towards them and chuckled menacingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a round of forced laughter after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi arched an eyebrow at them, the ridiculous sight in front of her, distracting her mind from fear for a split moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied with the response, Laura turned back to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The thing is, even outside the cave, my brother owns it all. You are still kissing another on the King&#39;s territory. I don&#39;t know if you are brave or just stupid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She folded her hands across her chest,  clicking her claws together, an evil grin stretching across her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But here is the thing, again. You never made it out of the cave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi looked back instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right there, behind her, where the cave they had come out from was a while ago, was an empty space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization crashed on her but it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The cave you are really looking for is far away from here. You were just dabbling in an illusion. Despite how much I don&#39;t want you here, I feel insulted that you think you could just slip away that easily. Have you no idea of how superior we are to you, wolves.&#34; She ended on a note of disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You evil---!&#34; George growled, his wolf taking full control at the full realization of the deception, but before he could move forward and attack them, a gush of wind rushed past Zezi, and in a blink of an eye, it all went down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever Zezi had expected wasn&#39;t what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all got dragged to the Castle, although Zezi wasn&#39;t blindfolded, her sight turned into a blur as a result of the speed used by the vampires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they got to the castle, she was swaying lightly on her feet from dizziness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crawled on her kneels, reaching quickly for her daughter, pulling her closer in protection, while George stood in front of them, ready to take on death. It reared its ugly head and challenged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what was happening and no matter what the Moon Goodness had in mind when she did this, this was his family and he would protect them till his last breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were in the throne room, surrounded by blood-sucking monsters (guards).</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George eyed the walls, looking around to see if there was any escape route they could take if things went south, farther south than they already had, but there were none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a throne at the center of the large room, then guards at each strategic point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wolf was whining in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they died now, it would all be his fault, fighting for a werewolf that wasn&#39;t even theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ignored him, still mad at what he had done earlier, concentrating instead on trying not to show fear in order to protect Zezi and Mira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open and there was the sound of boots clicking against the floor, then the sound of people bowing swiftly in respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi didn&#39;t need to turn around, she knew who that was. She held more onto her daughter, who, although didn&#39;t understand what was going on, she was already slightly shaking in her mother&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed her hand over her head, whispering to her slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mama is here, Papa is here, Don&#39;t be scared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother,&#34; Laura&#39;s sickening voice raised with a smile. &#34;I caught them trying to escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi looked up then, next to Laura now was Delice, her eyes filled with deep sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi looked away quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t going to be fooled by the female show of understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew they were all the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Monsters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lots of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let us go!&#34; George voiced out, his eyes glimmering red. &#34;She is not yours, she will never be yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi tensed up immediately, realizing what trouble this might lead be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t ready for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she looked up this time, her eyes locked with the King&#39;s, and her heart raced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed calm, but the way his hands clenched into fists by his sides and the way his eyes were stormy with rage gave him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is mine!&#34; George&#39;s voice thundered and she saw anger flashed in the King&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King looked away from her, his eyes now on George.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is--&#34; his voice cut short, pain shot through him, his neck stiffly raising, and then he crashed onto his knees, grunts of pain escaping his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;George,&#34; she ran to him immediately, but he was shaking on the floor, veins becoming visible from pain in his neck. &#34;What are you doing to him?!&#34; She yelled, glancing up at the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of what she had seen in the hallway flashed in her mind and fear took complete control of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood on the white floor, the struggle, the limp body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate to do whatever to stop this, afraid that she would lose him, promises threatened to tumble right out of her mouth, but she held her tongue, begging instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, stop.&#34; She cried, tears running down her cheeks, her hands around George.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy, wh-what is happening to Da-daddy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation spiked at her daughter&#39;s cry and the sight of her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do anything! I&#39;ll do anything, please stop.&#34;</p>
