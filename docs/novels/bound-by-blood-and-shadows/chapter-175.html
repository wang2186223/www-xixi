                <p>chapters, I&#39;m really sorry about this. I&#39;ll try to squeeze out time for them as soon as possible. Thank you so much for your understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>174 - Some Buried Memories</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To George and Delice, unconsciousness offered them memories of the night they had both forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For George, that had been one of the nights he had been on the run with Zezi. This was before they had even ever dreamt of finding a home in the Capital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had gone to a tavern while Zezi had been in a hut that they built together. He had no plans of staying there for too long, but he had been curious to find out what was happening in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had asked him a lot of questions before he could finally gain entry, they gave him a mask he hated, concealed his scent, and told him that he was responsible for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You die or live tonight, child.&#34; The man at the door had told him before pushing him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he staggered in, the sweet smell in the air lured out his wolf and that was where he had lost control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, the mastery of control he had over his wolf now was non-existent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Delice, it was a sneak-away night. She had found a way to escape from the castle, and she wanted to enjoy the little that she could before she was found yet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she had stumbled to this tavern, found a table, and took as much alcohol as she could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She danced, even though she wasn&#39;t much of a dancer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of men had appreciated her dancing and they wanted to join, but none of them seemed to match her rhythm like the strange man with the brown mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His red eyes were striking and something about him was in tune with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They danced, but not once did they exchange names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seductive singing that filled the tavern enticed them to do more, and they did. They stumbled into a room that she paid for because the man had no gold on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were intimate afterward, somewhere along their intimate tussle, their masks were gone, and so was the mask covering her urge for blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fangs sank into his neck and she fed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the most alive thing she had tasted in so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was done, his eyes had changed. He felt like a completely different being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bloodsucker!&#34; He had said with disgust. Then he hit his thumb over her head while he did the same to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had wiped both their memories clean of their meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had both passed out after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George woke up first, he had managed to get out of the room before passing out so when he woke up, he only found himself half-dressed on the tavern floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered nothing, his wolf was struggling to but the strain was too much, it exhausted the beast. Perhaps that was the beginning of the control he had over that part of him and that was also the beginning of their never-ending war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because to his wolf, he had already chosen another and Zezi was a mere crowd that had no place with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George left hurriedly that night and he didn&#39;t look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Delice woke up, she remembered nothing too, but she saw a brown mask on the bed, believed it was hers, and took it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t after that day - when she discovered that she was pregnant, did she started to think that the mask certainly belonged to the man who had impregnated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never remembered him, nor how they had met, she only remembered the mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, George felt that he was being followed, so he made him and Zezi begin their run again. On their way, they met the witch who told her that she was a lone wolf with no mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s grieving for her situation had distracted him and he never worried about why he found himself on the tavern floor again, believing that the alcohol was probably responsible for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice and George woke up that afternoon, with memories of how they met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George wouldn&#39;t look at her, he was angry with himself, but his wolf was pacing back and forth in his mind, eager to meet the &#34;mate&#34; he had chosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A Bloodsucker? Disgusting!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he knew how his wolf felt when he had chosen Zezi, but Zezi was different, she was one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loved her, his wolf just didn&#39;t like her because he had met Delice first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He regretted ever meeting that Bloodsucker!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought that she had tasted his blood twice made him rageful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi and the King of the Bastards were in the room. He was glad that Mira and Aunt Alice weren&#39;t here to see this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Laura told me that my child was a boy. I want to see Laura.&#34; The reason for his woes had spoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura was brought into the room after a while, worry written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You buried my child. You said she was a boy. Explain yourself.&#34; Delice had asked and another detail of the event was revealed, not without Laura first trying to deny the accusations, of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did it to make you perfect.&#34; She had begun. &#34;Another man&#39;s child is an obstacle to being Queen. I wanted the best for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night Delice had given birth, Laura had taken the child away to bury, but she had found a witch that needed a baby to prepare a certain spell. In exchange, she had received a spellbook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was nothing but I thought it was better than killing the baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed the witch had done something to the child and had gotten tired of it, so she left it outside the border of a pack for it to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That might be why the child&#39;s growth is slow and she isn&#39;t looking her age.&#34; Laura ended with not a hint of remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You told me she was a son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you would never try to look for her. So you would never find her. I did it all for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I&#39;m going to kill you, you fucking crazy bitch!&#34; That was Zezi and her next action put her words into motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, chaos erupted in the hospital ward.</p>
