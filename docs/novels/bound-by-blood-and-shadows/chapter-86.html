                <p>Laura didn&#39;t say anything and Delice&#39;s clutch against her gown tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went there tonight.&#34; When she spoke this time, her smile had faded away, and the tears that had long gown empty in her eyes were starting to well up again, making them shimmer under the soft light of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Blood, Delice. You shouldn&#39;t have done that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, the words building up in her threatening to choke her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; It was a whisper. Her shoulders hung low in defeat, her gaze fixed to the floor. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, for this and for everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s arms came around her, as she pulled her into the room, whispering back, &#34;I forgive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taller vampire pulled away from Delice to shut the door behind them and the scent of the herbs that was a constant in Laura&#39;s room rushed into her lungs, but Delice was too devasted tonight to think too much of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched her friend as she retreated from the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you do it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura straightened up as if she had been called up against a crime and told to defend her stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did it for you.&#34; The words rolled off her tongue. &#34;I always do it all for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice blinked, looking everywhere else to avoid the tears from overcoming her again, but her gaze landed on Laura and her whole body shook with the tears that came pouring down right after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry.&#34; She recited the lines that were always readily hanging somewhere on her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura pulled her into an embrace again, patting her back gently, reminding her that she had been forgiven, not just for going to the grave, but for how she had reacted to knowing that she was with Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her unwarranted anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice knew that what Laura was doing was wrong. She had known for a long time that Laura always had a wrong way of doing things, but she also believed that the person that needed to keep sacrificing whenever she took her usual wrong steps, was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura didn&#39;t have a mother, she had lost her early in life and she was trained differently to perceive things . Although Delice didn&#39;t have a mother too, she believed that the circumstances of their lose had made them turn out differently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, it was Laura&#39;s nature to go after things that she wanted, so if there was anyone that needed to make sacrifices continuously, it had to be her, that was what Mother&#39;s did anyways and Delice was filling in that role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Mummy&#39; Delice wasn&#39;t the only one playing a needed role in their friendship, Laura was too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the Protector.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a person as weak as Delice was, she needed someone strong to look out for her and that strong person, was Laura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t risk losing her. If anything happened and she lost her, her life would fall into shambles. Laura was the pillar holding her life up and without it, she was nothing. The only way she knew how to live her life was with Laura in it, and she wouldn&#39;t risk having it otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time she had tried to seperate from her, she had a child and before she could even really have it, she lost that child. If Laura hadn&#39;t found her that night, she might have become a past herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, no matter how many things she was doing wrong, her presence was doing something right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides she knew Laura loved her, she only had a different way of showing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their friendship was precious, worth every sacrifice that she had made and the ones that she would make in future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura moved her out of her embrace, looking straight at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look like a complete mess.&#34; She whispered, a shadow of a sad smile tugging up her lips. &#34;One second without me and your life is already falling into shambles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice bit her lips. She knew this was coming, Laura was right about that but hearing it always seemed to hurt ten times more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hand that cupped her cheeks were firm, as Laura stared her dead in the eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bad things always happen to you whenever you leave me, you know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that she just had that whole thought process wasn&#39;t helping one bit, the grave flashing at the back of her mind, the name engraved on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes stung as they welled up with tears again. Tears that Laura wiped away easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing good goes on in your life without me in it.&#34; She raised her head up, making her look back at her, her own eyes now welling up with tears and her voice cracking from how much the words shook her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura wasn&#39;t the one to always break down and cry but whenever she did, she always meant what she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I protect you, you are weak, you need my protection and I give it to you everything I have because I love you.&#34; Her hands fell from her cheeks, holding and caressing Delice&#39;s shaky hands instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you are just as important to me, Delice. You are like a mother to me. A mother and a friend in one, you are rare and I am lucky. So how dare you leave me? How do you expect I survive without you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s tears were always cracking with snorts, just as it was doing right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice&#39;s hands moved away from her weak own and went around her instead, pulling her into an embrace, the fact that she was much taller, making it look awkward, but this was something they had done for so long, it didn&#39;t feel out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, it was easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that, the roles had fallen back into the right places and instinctively Delice was comforting her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were so cruel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am so sorry, Laura.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So mean by leaving me alone and not being happy for me.&#34; Laura&#39;s hands tightened around her while she brawled. &#34;You hurt me so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; Delice blinked but she couldn&#39;t see what was ahead, the tears in her eyes were just too much, they clouded her sight. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Laura. I won&#39;t do that again, I promise. I won&#39;t do that again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I forgive you.&#34; She rested her chin on Delice&#39;s head. &#34;I truly forgive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again, the usual thing was at play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice begging for forgiveness and Laura granting it.</p>
