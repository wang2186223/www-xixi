                <p>From the unbuttoned part of his shirt, she could see the zig zag lines on his chest, up to his neck. For a spilt second, she wondered if it had taken over his whole body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the wolf is not your mate. His mark is already gone! Vanished.&#34; He said with emphasis but it had come across as a threat with his physical look at the moment and Zezi found herself, despite knowing that he wouldn&#39;t hurt her, taking a step back while her claws replaced her fingernails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What more hold does he have on you? What more ties do I have to break for us to be? Make me understand why the unworthy wolves must stand in our way. Why? Tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love them!&#34; Zezi snapped, overwhelmed by her tiredness and anger. She drove her fingers through her hair, holding a fistful, while she looked around the room, a pained smile plastered on her face. &#34;Yes, I love that unworthy adopted pup and I love that wolf I married very much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurt flashed in those eyes and somehow, she felt it hit her heart as he stared back at her like he was trying to understand her but it was gone as soon as it came, and rage filled those black pools once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is impossible to love that which isn&#39;t yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was something he was certain of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Experience had taught him and he was a good student.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mother&#39;s sleepless night when she had wept her eyes out about his father was a prove of the impossiblity of the love. The many years his father, along with his step mother, had locked him up in a basement and made use of his soul for more powers was a prove of that. How they had ignored his pleads for mercy while they took from him until he had nothing to give was a prove of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything that had happened in his life so far was a prove of that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even for her too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was a prove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she not see it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolf could never really love her completely as he, her mate, would, nor as he did right now. One day, he would finally slip and he would kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like his father had killed his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was impossible to truly love that which one wasn&#39;t fated for, especially when the fated one appears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that were ever to happen, things would usually change from impossible to fatal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The so called love she believed she had for the wolf was a mere illusion and he would be damned to allow her slip into the kind of fate that he knew all too well would end terribly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would protect her, keep her here by his side and love her till she would realize there was no where better for her to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know how he would go about that but he would learn. Especially the love part, he knew he had so much to learn when he came to that and he was ready to read as much books as possible, ask for as many advice as needed, just to be well equiped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silence was starting to drag on for too long. She had replied him when he talked about the impossiblity of what her heart felt by saying she was a prove of otherwise but he seemed to be deliberating ignoring that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he said more to himself. &#34;All you need is time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter, I will always love---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think he loves you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you must he in love with physical abuse. Is that what I am missing? An attribute I should perhaps exhibit for your attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something stirred unpleasantly in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you are any different from George? That you are the better option?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am the chosen one. Fated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have held me against my will, threatened me with the lives of my family and---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had no other choice. Do you think I would have done all of that if you had just accepted our bond? Do you ever think of me? I am your mate. Put yourself in my shoes, what would you have done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed. Tired when she didn&#39;t give an immediate response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do not---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have heard enough. This argument is leading no where.&#34; He shushed her with a finger across her lips and all she could notice was how his claw was long enough that it pass over her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seem every moment tonight reminded her more and more of how dangerous he was. What he represented, what she hated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very creature the Moon Godnes had tied her destiny with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How cruel fate was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight.&#34; Just like that, he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, she tried to call after him. There was still more that she like to hear, more she would like to know, something just told her that there was more to this and she wanted to find out what it was. Something in her made her crave to understand but she shut her lips immediately, remembering that she still didn&#39;t know his name. He never gave it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made her realize one more thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t said her name either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shouldn&#39;t be bothered but something seemed to hurt in her when he didn&#39;t say it and it hurt even more when it was followed by the silent slam of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shut up to her chest and she frown, tears glimmering in her eyes. Then she wiped the tears away angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she crying?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angry at herself, she stared at the marked wall, the deep scratches till she could faintly see the light from the hallway, emitting from the brick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t matter to her. She only needed him for her mission. That was the only reason she was concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at the candles, her anger grew and she put them off. Next she switched on the light and started planning on now to get rid of Gwen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two thoughts later and the thought of the King had made its way into her heart again. Angry, she threw her fists again the mirror. It shattered to the ground and to the dressing table, some pieces sinking into her knuckles, making them bleed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an intent gaze, she pulled them out, along the line, more tears streamed down her cheeks and couldn&#39;t stop herself this time before breaking down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she crying?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>

                <p>I apologize for my recent inconsistent update, school has resumed and I haven&#39;t come up with a schedule to quite balance it yet, but soon enough, I&#39;ll find one and stick with it. Thank you for all your support.))</p>
