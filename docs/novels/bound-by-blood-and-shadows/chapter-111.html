                <p>His lips had been cold against hers, at first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unresponsive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Till they sealed against hers with full possession, harsh, rough, passionate. Like this was an unexpected opportunity and he intended to exploit it in every way possible, savour every last moment of it and ensure not to let even one go to waste. His hands went around her, one around her waist to keep her pressed to him and the other below her head, keeping her in possible, so he could ravish her lips as he wished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her environment had changed in a blur that made her dizzy and cling unto him for dare life. A bag followed soon after, only for her to be pushed against a wall a second later, his body pressing against hers, holding her captive, his lips now warm and even more demanding, the bond between them straining with an increased need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling that crossed through her veins was undeniable. She opened herself to him and let him savor the taste of her lips, while she did the same to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to push forward, but his body pressed down hers, their bodies almosy molding into one, as every part of her ignited with sparks she couldn&#39;t control the closer they got. His hand had slipped in-between the slit of her gown and grabbed her thigh, anchoring it around him so she had no choice but to settle on his demanding bulge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shot up, one cupping the back of his neck, and the other going around him for the lack of direction her sexually fogged brain just couldn&#39;t provide no matter how hard she tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she knew was that she wanted, no, needed to touch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi felt overly aware of him, his rough passion making her straddle him with each move they made in unison.  The wave of lust that took over her weren&#39;t just her own, it was too much to be. So much, it almost sent her mind to a point of dizziness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel his lust, struggling against his restraint while a growl tumbled from his chest as he kissed her like this would be their last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was how it felt, to be with one&#39;s mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was something she almost would have never known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was heavenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was breathtaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to breath. Her hand shoved against his chest and her protest were filled with gasps and moans that she couldn&#39;t control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to breath!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick pulled away reluctantly, his nose falling the croak of her neck, her slight struggle for air, music to his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her breath always made him feel some way that he couldn&#39;t describe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pleasant? Certainly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she tried to catch her breath, her hand had slipped to his hair and grabbed a fistful, making his crown tilt forward to his forehead in a funny manner. It was a wonder how he still even had it on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he breathe her in, only one thought took over his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had kissed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mate had kissed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made the first move and he reciprocated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kissed him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never would have thought that she would do that. It must mean that she had been very serious about giving him a fair chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a couple of moments and blinks for Zezi to finally see what was in front of her, she had felt so dazed by the heated moment they had shared, that it seemed her logicality, along with her sight, had gone for a short break then, suddenly, now returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt his tongue slithered across her neck, his fangs nipping slightly at a spot that made her cling even more to him, while she bit her lips to surpress the moan that threatened to burst right out of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breathing was heavy by the time he was done with the turtore, more out of breath than before. Her neck was smooth and healed from any injury. Valerick&#39;s gaze wandered to her deep V neckline, watching as her chest rose and fell in an uneven rhythm, his need for her surged in his pants and his fangs poked out even more from the corners of his lips. His gums swollen from the need for him to bury those fangs into her flesh when her grip on his hair tightened.p</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this finally it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she let him mark her?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought his lips down to hers that was already slightly swollen from the earlier kiss they had just shared, but she titled her head to the other direction, denying him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had heard his heart shatter at that point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gritted his teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment there, he had thought tonight would be different but now, once again, his hands would have to be at his service.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put me down, Valerick.&#34; She whispered, her voice sounding so breathy that it lacked the authoritative tone it normally had to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One part of him was happy that he was the one who had had done that to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fated mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would like to have her on his bulge a little longer, it felt warm to be in-between her thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valerick.&#34; She breathed, becoming too aware of him for her own good. Even during the Full Moon, Zezi didn&#39;t think she had been this close to him. &#34;By the Moon, put me down! Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes was filled with lust and the air bustling with the enticing smell. It took every ounce of strength in him not to attend to that instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ground threatened to sway underneath her feet but she had forced herself to stand up straight on her legs that felt like jelly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been so long since she paid her sexual need any active attention, that must be why her longing for him had increased so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe if she touched herself tonight, she would be able to get him out of her mind for at least a little while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe... Just maybe.</p>
