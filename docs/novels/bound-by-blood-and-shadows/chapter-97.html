                <p>When the King moved towards her drawers, Zezi&#39;s heart jumped with panic then she relaxed when she remembered that she had kept the letters somewhere else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence was suspicious, she wondered if he had come here to confirm the fact about the letters, find more evidence that could actually stand against her, or had he, despite his demeanour earlier, trusted his sister&#39;s claim against her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where she was standing a little distance away from him and by the door, she could hardly see what he was doing. The fear that rushed into her lungs as different thoughts about what he could possibly be getting involved with at her dressing table, forced her to ask. Thankfully, she had sounded more in control then how her mental state was in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Setting up candles.&#34; He answered bluntly and with a gruff. It was then that she notice the flickering golden glow in front of him and the earthy scent that lightly swept passed her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so calming, she could almost feel it seep into every pore of her skin ease. She used to love scented candles like this, they made her feel at peace, even helped her take away her nightmares sometimes. At the beginning of her relationship with George she had discussed her need for scented candles with him but the times he forgot were more than the times he remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory made her eyes water. It also reminded her of the nightmare she had about him recently. About her family. She really hoped they were doing well without her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a step further, the scent of the candle flooded into her nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frankincense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi took in a deep breath, trying to shut all the peaceful memories that came with that scent away. It was just the one she liked and she didn&#39;t want to associate this time with the King of her enemies to anything that would mean so much to her heart, more so in a position light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the matchstick as it kissed the wick of the last candle seeped into her ears and the next second, he had put it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your nightmares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned, crossing her hands across her in a sought of defence, like she needed something physical to stay inbetween them at that very moment. A shield to protect her from whatever feeling was going to sprout out of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the need to take back control, she steered the conversation away to a topic she believed she would have no trouble manipulating to her advantage and blurted out her question without any real deep thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you show off the hickeys?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, that had ended pretty quickly. Also, that had been a poor choice. It was a good thing it had ended quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sound angry.&#34; She said, waiting for him to turn to her but his back was rigid and she continued. &#34;Angry at me. Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed, keeping mute like he wouldn&#39;t talk at first, allowing the room to be thrown into a sort of silence that was only broken by Zezi&#39;s rhythmic breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As silent as it was, he could hear it. He even enjoyed it, despite himself. It was something he loved about her, that she could breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silence was starting to trouble Zezi though, more than she would like to admit. When he finally spoke, his voice was quite, like he was trying his best not to hear the words that were coming out of his mouth because of how much they hurt him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said his name...&#34; He turned, his black eyes holding hers in a powerful gaze, &#34;in your sleep.&#34; He ended it and watched her suck in a shaky breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she be unconscious yet think of that wolf? She couldn&#39;t even think of him, her mate, when she had full control of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made him feel insignificant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unseen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How much longer would he have to fight for her to even think him worthy enough to occupy a space in her mind,  that wasn&#39;t one of bitter hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, she walked closer to him, stopping when she stood at the edge of her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that it? Because she said her husband&#39;s name in her sleep?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was having a nightmare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a singular nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her response had not done anything to put a pause to his anger and the coldness in his next words confirm that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope the candles will help ease your nightmares. Goodnight. I have other things to get to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed, pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I didn&#39;t ask you to spend time lighting candles for me.&#34; She said after him as he took each step further away from her and towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The closer he got to the door, the more an irresistible urge took over her. She wanted him to stay. What was he leaving already?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is your name?&#34; The words rushed out of her mouth and that did it. He paused in his track, not taking a step further or back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just thought about it and it&#39;s been months and I still don&#39;t know your name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know mine. Tell me yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that you may say it in your sleep?&#34; His cold voice cut across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled nervously, running her hands over her shoulders just to keep them busy. &#34;You can never tell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned, staring at her with scrutinizing eyes and she straightened up under his gaze, gulping from just the very need of feelimg her breath being whisked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started walking back and she seemed to count his steps in her head. She stood her ground, determined not to move despite how much he was intimidating her, but when he got close enough that his boots were only an inch away from hers, she fell back to the bed, sitting at the edge with a thud. He lean forward, so close that if she wanted to seal her lips against his, all it would require was for her to lean in just a little bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he was breathing, his breath would mingle with hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand hovered over her face and her hands fell by her side on the bed, grabbing the sheets as she fought against the emotions that were trying to possess her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the mate bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt nothing for him. Whatever was going on was the matebo---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; She gasped, as his hand curved behind her neck, pulling her towards him, his cold lips grazing the lobe of her right ear, his whispers lighting fire in her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a struggle to keep her eyes open, it was a struggle not to give in and just surrender to him once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me the truth. Could that really, ever, be possible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi wanted to remain loyal to her mission, so much that her claws dug into the inside of her palms to distract herself with pain as usual but still his lure was quite one to wrestle with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he just take a step back so she could think straight?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you are lying to me. But never mind, I might have just the trick to fix all of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he had done next was something Zezi hadn&#39;t expected.</p>
