                <p>&#34;You are in a relationship with someone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice watched how she tucked the phone away into her pants pocket. Laura hardly used that phone. This moment was strange for many reasons. &#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That? It&#39;s not important.&#34; She flashed her a fanged grin, before they retracted. &#34;Come, let me fix your hair for dinner. If we are lucky, the King will show up. If not, I will have to come up with more creative ideas to break you into my brother&#39;s schedule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura walked over to her, observing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice nodded stiffly, running her hand through her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34; Her voice was determined, filled with a silent threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand held Delice&#39;s left arm, her grip painfully firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34; Her smile was fanged again, but Delice didn&#39;t try to pull away or put up a fight. All she had to do was answer her question. Laura wouldn&#39;t be mad if she had just answered her question the first time though. If this was quickly getting out of hand, then it was entirely her fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you coming from, Delice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gwen&#39;s.&#34; She answered with a defeated sigh and a gentle smile that fell quickly. &#34;I took her home. She planned a dinner between the King and his mate, but it didn&#39;t go well. She was so worried. Poor thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s grip loosened around her arm and she dropped her hand from Delice&#39;s arm, chuckling hysterically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will never work. The stupid wolf makes it easy for it all to be ruined, and I&#39;d rather die than have her as my Queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing her arm across Delice&#39;s shoulder, she started walking to her room, making Delice follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I stay away long enough,&#34; she started saying in a quiet pleading voice, &#34;maybe you&#39;ll let me go and visit the grav--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m serious, Delice,&#34; she shut her up before she completed that statement, knowing fully well where it was heading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delice was way too attached to that stinky death hole for no reason. After all these years, she should have allowed her past go, but she was obsessed with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only good thing Delice had in her life was Laura and that was her. Without her being her best friend, Laura was sure that Delice would have reduced to nothing a long time ago. Delice needed to be controlled and she, on the other hand, needed someone to control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their friendship was perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want you anywhere near that stinky place. It smells like death. Not the kind I like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, does that mean you&#39;ll never let me---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; She held her doorknob, pushing the wooden frame open. &#34;It is for the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slammed shut behind them, and Laura switched on the dull blue light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You trust me right, Delice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With my soul.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura smiled, moving to her table, which was almost weighed down with the number of small bottles on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deliec trusted her with her soul, and Laura trusted her with that and her more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No relationship was more perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No relationship was more balanced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time flies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And time flies fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been two weeks since the dinner and everything seemed to be stagnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were no invites for dinners anymore, thankfully. If she had to see the King again, she really didn&#39;t know what she would have done to herself or him or anyone around. What she found strange though, was the sudden disappearance of her guards by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two days after the dinner, Gwen had wheeled in her trolley more than twice a day. Zezi had been curious and asked if her visiting time had been extended but Gwen replied that there were no guards at the door anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was strange, and instead of it making her feel less of a prisoner, it just made her feel on edge like this was a step toward a devious plan that the King had in mind. Gwen had handed her the keys, but that had only helped her to keep the doors locked at all times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever the King was planning, she certainly wouldn&#39;t fall prey to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, there was the mystery sender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi had sometimes kept the door open throughout the night, in case the mystery sender would drop by but up till now, there was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there was the sadness that kept on building up in her heart. She missed her family. Dearly. She had framed the stick figures of them that she had drawn and placed it on the dressing table. The sadness just felt really consuming. She wanted to train, to make it stay off her mind, but she was scared that the King needed her to roam around the castle in order for whatever sick plan he had to come to pass, so she had decided against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, she felt like her life was on hold, like she was in a void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi pulled her night robe over her, she still hadn&#39;t changed her wardrobe yet. What was the use?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was numb about everything, except the fact that this was her seventh shower tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just felt really hot and she couldn&#39;t explain why. She was tempted to lay on her bed naked, but she planned to keep the door open for the mystery sender once again tonight, and she wouldn&#39;t want whosoever that was to walk in on her naked, be it a man or a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her back came in contact with the bed, and she rolled over. Why did this bed feel so hot? The curtains were pulled aside, and the windows were opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, it felt like the air had ceased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gritted her teeth in sharp pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mark. George&#39;s mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was fading away again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was really tiring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tossed and turned, her hand on the mark, the heat and pain now a familiar one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyelids shut tight, while she tried to wait this torturous moment out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the painful groans tore through her throat. As if being controlled, she shot up from her bed, her eyes fully blue. With speed, she was right in front of her door, pushing it open with a demanding intensity before slamming it shut behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trail of first rain aura filled her nose, and she followed it, pushing the pain that felt absolutely wrecking aside while she leaned against the walls, her claws digging slightly into it to keep her on her feet as she moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even know where she was going. She couldn&#39;t think. Her brain was fogged with a desperate need, a pain that consumed her very being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She panted, huffed, and breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wherever she was headed, held her relief and nothing would stand in her way of getting it.</p>
