                <p>The library was quiet and the same as she remembered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poorly lit, white lights placed at a distance too far from each other, maybe because of the vampire&#39;s overly sensitive sight or maybe not; Zezi really didn&#39;t care. The large hall was filled with numerous high shelves with books in them, rightly ventilated, and with the Librarian missing from his or her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except that this time around, she was visiting the library in the middle of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something or someone that had been present the last time she had been here though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until that thought had crossed Zezi&#39;s mind that she considered the fact that she might run into her again, just as she had the first time she had visited the library.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi hoped she wouldn&#39;t though, not because she didn&#39;t have believable lies to tell as her reason for being here, but because she just felt that she had seen enough of Lady Delice for tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too many encounters between them, and she might start seeing her in a different light, and that was something that Zezi really wanted to avoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An enemy was an enemy and no matter the camouflage personality they put forward, one shouldn&#39;t be tricked to see them differently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi wasn&#39;t about to lose a battle before it even started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that the Librarian&#39;s seat was empty wasn&#39;t an issue but, the possibility that the whole library was just as empty, was starting to bother her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took in a deep breath, listening in with her werewolf hearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she let out an exhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, she was the only one here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Different new thoughts were starting to run through her mind; maybe it was the slightly echoing silence that was getting to her or the cold temperature of the library, but these disturbing thoughts kept increasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if this was a trap?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why hadn&#39;t she thought about the possibility of this being that before? Was it stupid that she hadn&#39;t made enough findings about anything going on in the castle before coming here? Yes, she should have tried to find out if there were rumours of a possible revolution that was going on underground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a Zeta, this was a mistake she had fallen victim to because of her emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mixing emotions with logic?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was too late to walk out of this now. Besides, she had nothing to lose, so she would see this till the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then again, if this was just a ploy made by the King to see if she hated him, she wasn&#39;t shy or afraid to give him the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, she hated him and she wasn&#39;t scared of the consequences of that. In fact, with her actions lately, that was no secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, there was a high possibility that this was just a trick. A trap. A bait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her instincts told her otherwise, and Zezi always trusted that tingling thing in her brain; it had led her to more victories than failures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kept her alive even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi moved slowly along the aisle in between the shelves that were on either side, her fingers tapping on the hardcovers, subconsciously searching for &#34;The Dark Times&#34; while observing her surroundings in a search for the mystery sender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm,&#34; Zezi sighed, flipping through a book before putting it back on the shelf and picking another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around at the silent space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chairs were empty, and the tables were just as empty; she was sure those back seats even had cobwebs all over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why were they neglecting their library so much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Lady Delice the only vampire that read books in this Castle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as Zezi wasn&#39;t a writer, she was a reader and this display of carelessness certainly wasn&#39;t how a place of books should be treated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It unsettled her in a kind of way that she couldn&#39;t describe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also wondered if something had happened here for people to have deserted it in the first place, probably something that happened during the Dark Times. Before? After?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, this Castle and the entirety of the Kingdom were filled with questions, but to want the answers to those questions was to be interested in the Castle and its people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi wasn&#39;t interested and she didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put the book in her hands back on the shelf, her eyes skimming over to find another. Then she reached for it but another&#39;s hand was doing the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth from the hands that brushed against hers was foreign, the sound of the heartbeat that filled her ears, strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, there was no scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi took a step back from the person, her hand tight on the book they had both reached out for but she had quickly grabbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe there will be another of that.&#34; His voice was a little hoarse, light with humor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man standing in front of her wore a pair of black pants, a fitted shirt, and a hood over his head that hid away most part of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe.&#34; She said, her voice firm, her grip tight around the book, her eyes sharp with observation, her demeanour filled with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I better go searching then.&#34; He by-stepped her, then stopped, before turning back to meet her unwavering gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m looking for someone, by chance, have you seen her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll decide when you tell me who you are looking for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled the hood away, the fact that he was backing the dim light made a shadow cast over his face but Zezi could see it clearly with her wolf sight. He was a slightly muscular man, with hooded eyes, high cheekbones, and lips as thin as a line, black short beards, and a mustache, but not a single hair on his head.  His skin was as dark as hers, no--- a shade lighter. He looked young, like he was twenty or thereabout. He looked like he could be keeping things on him. She took in a sniff for silver or wolfsbane but she found none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My ally.&#34; He said to her, his lips tugged up in a side smile. &#34;Are you her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never seen this face before. He was not a vampire; his eyes didn&#39;t look so soulless, his aura felt vibrant with life, and his scent was non-existent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi became defensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated it to be at a loss of something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>((I don&#39;t have a good feeling about this.))</p>
