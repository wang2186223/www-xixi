                <p>Gwen had been a great help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she had been comforting her for the wrong reasons, just having her there while she sobbed her heart out had made her feel better afterwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Better enough to have a bath and change into her blue silk nightrobe with a thick brown robe over it, and wander off into the Castle&#39;s garden for some fresh air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was ticking closer and closer to midnight and she still haven&#39;t found a way to feed the posion to him. As she played with the tiny bottle in her hand, though, there was a different thing on her mind, one that was totally not related to the bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was next after finding out she had feelings for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, up till now, she hadn&#39;t figured it out and she had decided not to worry about it for now. She would just take things as they came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was too wrapped up in her feelings tonight and so much had happened. She would make decisions when her head felt a little clearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a look at the garden, the lights around and the way the moon above accentuated it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a wonder to behold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been here before, during one of Valerick&#39;s earlier dinner invites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hatred for him then had been an inferno and she had been so blinded by it that she hadn&#39;t take note of this beauty and everything in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fountain, the flowers, the way the air felt light and free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night had also been the night she had gotten her first invite to the White Circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should take these walks some more, they felt refreshing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The further she went, the more things she discovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Moon, there was a pool with little dim blue lights around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water was almost still and the star filled sky reflected in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It reminded of Valerick mother&#39;s painting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that was missing was the rain and it would be a complete representation, but there was just this earthy rain smell that was present so it felt complete nevertheless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling more at ease, Zezi wondered if she should go for a swim in the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was quiet and the water might help her think, maybe if she stayed here long enough, midnight would tick away so fast and the The White Circle wouldn&#39;t find her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting a look at her nightrobe, Zezi took off the thick brown jacket, putting it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would leave her nightgown on. It was short, to her midthigh. Besides, it was better to get it wet than to go in naked anyways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water was surprisingly warm. She had expected it to be cold but she liked it like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed in pleasure as she felt it moved beneath her nightgown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this comfort, she could live in this pool forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had she been in this Castle for so long and not know that there was a pool?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swarm to the other side, exploring and her soul almost left her body when she saw someone emerge from the water, water dripping down his hair and the little droplets on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked back at her, confused for only a second, before he smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Moon, this vampire was a different kind of wonder under the moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he always been this glorious in whatever space and element he was found?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he always this perfect no matter the circumstances, no matter the situation or condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Blood, I&#39;m surprised you are here.&#34; The smile was evident in his voice as much as it was radiant on his face. &#34;I had thought I would have to wait longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still needed her space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t---&#34; her voice trailed off when she saw a fading cut across his cheek. It was very light, and if she didn&#39;t have such a good sight, she wouldn&#39;t have even seen it. &#34;What is this?&#34; She frowned, running her fingers across it. &#34;Were you hurt? Did the Den do this to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick&#39;s cuts always healed in a flash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had been attacked and the fading cut could still be seen, Zezi was worried that the attack must have been a major one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Dens?&#34; He chuckled. &#34;No way.&#34; He grabbed her hand that had reached out to him instead, and checked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gwen took care of i--&#34; she felt her back against one end of the pool and in a flash, she realized he was once again trapping her with his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must enjoy this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Always having her trapped beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it still hurt, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze was intent on the plastered cut on her hand and despite how much she just wanted to lie that it didn&#39;t, she enjoyed how his hand lingered on her skin, although not much of a fan of the the inferno it lit in her veins, that she as still trying to figure out what to do about it, but the peace that it somehow brought with it was something she wanted to hold on to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Just a couple of days---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So many hours in pain.&#34; He cut her off sharply but his anger wasn&#39;t directed at her. &#34;These cuts must be all over you.&#34; Then his gaze met hers, and he leaned down towards her. &#34;Let me take the pain away. All of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi gulped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even seemed to have moved closer now but the more she looked at him, the more she felt that she was right where she needed to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a response, after waiting for a while, he started to let her go but she grabbed his hand immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Take it away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if she felt he was pushing into her personal space before, now he was about to make himself a home in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tongue was on her body, against every cut, her cuts sealings up, the pain dwindling away, as he muttered something about how sweet her blood tasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could feel his fangs scratch lightly against her skin at a point, and that had made her lose her battle against shutting her eyes from the pleasure that seeped into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closed they went and backwards, her head moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was his tongue so good?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ached to touch him, but she gripped the end of the pool instead, biting her lips to stiffle a moan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he held her other hand to take care of that too, though, he found a bottle in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart dropped and every form of pleasure she had felt so far morphed into fear at his question, as he rolled the small bottle inbetween his long fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34;</p>
