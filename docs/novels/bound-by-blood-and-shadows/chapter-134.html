                <p>Invitations were sent out quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The castle was bustling with different activities in preparation for the fast-approaching Joining Ceremony. It reminded Zezi of the time she had just gotten to the Castle and seen how the hall was decorated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen had told her back then that it was for the King&#39;s wedding and she had been petrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was funny that now it was happening and she wasn&#39;t feeling the way she had felt those six months ago. She was scared, yes, but it was for a different reason. Something more complicated than her hatred for him or his kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately Lady Delice had gotten the wind of the coming Joining Ceremony; that was after the night she and Valerick had completed the bond, she had appeared at her doorstep, looking absolutely worried for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what is going to happen to him. Lady Zezi, why are you letting this happen? You are going to die.&#34; She had declared, her feverish hands holding Zezi&#39;s own with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Zezi knew the ceremony was happening for complicated reasons, a part of her was pissed at Lady Delice for not being happy for her, a part of her that chose to be delusional and wanted to act like a werewolf excited to be joined to her fated mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents&#39; bodies would be rolling in the grave right now, that was if they had been buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. They had been torn open and their blood drained, life sucked right out of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Princess on the other hand had looked pleased with the arrangement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi wondered how Valerick would feel to know that his sister wanted him dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Step-sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the things that she had heard in the castle and the research she had burdened herself with, Zezi discovered that Valerick was the son of the former King&#39;s first mate, a mate he had chosen. He had later dethroned her, and made a concubine, when he found his fated mate, with whom he had had the Princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick&#39;s mother had been just like George. The relationship between the siblings wasn&#39;t what she had expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she assumed Valerick would be hurt to find out about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she even doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was doing the same thing to him, but for her kind. She would pick her kind over her fated mate anytime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the sake of those who had died at his father&#39;s hands, and for the sake of those who were presently living through his torture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the maids prepared her for her Joining Ceremony, Zezi hoped that her family would be able to make it. She missed them, a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the time of the ceremony drew nearer and there were still no signs of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe they wouldn&#39;t be able to make it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Moon, this would ruin everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really wanted to see her daughter, Aunt Alice, and... George.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to talk to him. He would tell her everything that was going on within the Packs, only from him would she get the real truth. He was the Beta, he would have information that Aunt Alice didn&#39;t know about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped that Valerick hadn&#39;t done anything to make it impossible for him to attend, considering the history she had with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All done. You are ready, Milady.&#34; Zezi smiled, looking at herself in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the most glamorous white dress she had ever been in. It was a backless dress, with three silver plated decorative chains that pulled the fabric together behind her, long sleeves - that almost touched her fingers- made with the color of her skin, granting the white artistic designs the opportunity to dazzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The neckline was a deep V-cut and just as Valerick had said, the necklace he had given her rested between the space. The gown had no slits, hugged her hips, and became free enough around her knees, sweeping the floor behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair was braided into a bun, and white pearls were pressed into her hair to decorate it. She had in her earlobe, long earrings that looked like crystals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are so beautiful, Milday,&#34; the seamstress complimented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Zezi replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the maids started talking, flooding her with compliments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are about to stun everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His Majesty will not be able to hold himself once he sees you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will have an heir in no time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They giggled and Zezi&#39;s face flushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great, these maids were part of Gwen&#39;s group, but that was to be expected. She has personally selected them herself. Also with how there were many vampires that hated the werewolves just as she hated them, it was good that Gwen had done a thorough selection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi sighed, looking at herself in the mirror again because she just couldn&#39;t get enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Moon, she was stunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More stunning than she had been when Gwen had dressed her up for her first dinner with Valerick. Unlike the dress she had worn that night, this dress had no high collars, putting Valerick&#39;s mark on full display. It was a good thing the maids had helped her cover the hickeys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had also been embarrassing because they just wouldn&#39;t stop giggling, but she endured it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small price to pay to ensure her family wouldn&#39;t see them... because they would surely come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reassured herself, her fingers trailing along her necklace, feeling a buzz beneath her skin as her mind wandered to Valerick, and the temptation to reach to him through the bond called to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mistress!&#34; Gwen sprinted into the room, almost yanking the door from its hinges with how fast she had thrown it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi sprung up, alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gwen? What is--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look stunning, we&#39;ll have an heir soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Gwen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t wait for you to meet my family. They love you, already. You&#39;ll love them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is my family here yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Mistress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did you run in like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, yes! It is time for the ceremony, we must leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maids rushed out and Zezi was led right out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they would get to the hall though, Gwen had engulfed Zezi in a tight embrace, her eyes glassy and her voice filled with genuine gratitude and sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for giving him a chance. Thank you for giving us a chance, Milady. You are such a blessing, we don&#39;t deserve you, yet you are here. We are lucky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she really a blessing? And were they truly lucky?</p>
