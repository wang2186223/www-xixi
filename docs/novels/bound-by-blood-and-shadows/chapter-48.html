                <p>&#39;Grand dinners were one of the important shows of affection.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That line of the book still stuck to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an embarrassing thing that he had gone to the library to pick out a book titled &#39;Ways of the Heart&#39; after a very calculative search.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been torture to read the book, but he put himself under that torture anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had read the whole book and assimilated it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>280 pages that it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grand dinner was one of the unmistakable options the book had suggested, and he had prepared all that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adjusted himself in his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This black suit was hell. It was very uncomfortable, he preferred his robe. He had also sent a dress to her and a small part of him hoped that she would come in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had also been one of the steps to earn one&#39;s heart in the book. Sending the lady a beautiful dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, what if she thought all this was stupid? What if it made him look stupid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like an absolute idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen would have to get the full wrath of his anger if things turned on him. The last time he had ever felt a need to impress anyone was over two centuries ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That someone had been his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just remembering him once again had left a bitter taste in his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved this hand across his hair, stopping where his crown was, which didn&#39;t leave much space for his hand to run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he feeling so edge?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was already impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This extra mile? Was it even necessary?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if it all just made him look weak? That was---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of lily jammed into his nostrils, and with the wind picking up, it filled his lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat up straight, his gaze darting to the opening of the garden and he froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was even more beautiful than the first time he had seen her, more elegant, more graceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that green gown, she was perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing could ever look as perfect as she did under the moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Gwen had talked about the dinner, Zezi had expected to meet him at the dining hall, but obviously, this wasn&#39;t the dining hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the Palace&#39;s garden, adorned with colourful lights and water surrounding the podium that they sat in with different white flowers dancing on the surface of the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he planned this, or was the palace&#39;s garden always this glamorous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should have suspected things weren&#39;t going to be as &#39;usual&#39; as they normally would, though, when he sent her that green glowing and flowing gown with a diamond necklace to match and those low heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in her life had she worn something so expensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The necklace was a little huge and glimmering; her gown fitted her perfectly, which showed that Gwen must have helped him out in picking it, or maybe she was even the one who picked it out and packaged it. It had high collars, she had worn something similar last time, long sleeves and no slits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made her feel comfortable that she wasn&#39;t showing too much skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the idea of the whole dinner unsettled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A romantic gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It reminded her of George.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George wasn&#39;t one for large romantic gestures, it was something they couldn&#39;t afford until a while. Even now, something like this was something they couldn&#39;t afford. So they did little things, little things that she loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She missed her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Missed her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Missed her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George and Mira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty.&#34; She bowed lightly, moving to take a seat where a guard from the other side, moved on and pulled her chair back for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrong!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned, remembering the rule he had read in the book once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the one supposed to do that but it was too late now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a gentleman, the book had said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already sitting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food was set on the table, the aroma nothing to him. Human food wasn&#39;t necessary to his kind, like it was to the werewolves. Although, sometimes, they loved to play pretend and act like it was. He used to do that when he was just a young boy, about 10. There was just so much joy then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot had happened since then. Too much had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The aroma that pleased him the most was hers, if only he could have her by his side every time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole buffet was something she wasn&#39;t used to, this only happened when they were celebrating grand festivals in the Pack&#39;s Capital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The click of the King&#39;s fork against his plate surprised her but she quickly recovered from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up her fork, then served herself before leisurely digging the utensil into her food, engrossed in her thoughts too much to start eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that mystery sender around? Was the person watching right now? Cold he/she? What if this dinner changed the person&#39;s perspective of her? What if he/she believed she was no longer the King&#39;s enemy just because of a mere dinner?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mystery sender couldn&#39;t be stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have you been?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to hear her voice so much. He longed for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, that rule was written somewhere in the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making small talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were so many rules in that book and he hoped that he would be able to put them all into practice for a good result.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They seemed to be doing well so far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly how you&#39;ve made me, your Majesty.&#34; Her hand went around her goblet of the wine on the table, and she lifted it up to her lips; the aroma of the wine filled her nostrils, sweet and sharp, before thinking again and dropping it on the table. &#34;Highly miserable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face remained fixed, cold, and unflinching, but his hopes sank a little immediately at her statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This dinner was already starting to show no promise.</p>
