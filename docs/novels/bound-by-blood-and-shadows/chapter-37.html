                <p>He pulled her out of his embrace, watching her face, cupping it, using his fingers to comb her hair down, while his eyes lightly passed over his mark on her neck, a smile crossing his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy,&#34; Mira popped out in between them, &#34;the BloodSuckers took us somewhere, did something to Daddy-- I&#39;m tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mira was referring to the vampires as BloodSuckers now. The effect of staying around only George was starting to really show. Not that she disagreed with the term used.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her daughter fell into her open arms and she pulled her closer, sniffing her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smelt clean, still a little sick but she was okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi checked her body for any bite marks or any marks at all that signified pain, but she found none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunty fixed him.&#34; Mira put her teddy forward, and Zezi smiled, just plain happy that her family was indeed all right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mira baby, can you please go and sit over there? Daddy wants to talk to Mummy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And we are going home after?&#34; She asked, her eyes begging for a yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you are,&#34; Zezi replied, brushing her fingers through her hair playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mira enthusiastically left, not noticing what that answer had implied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George had though, but before he got the chance to speak about it, Zezi was quick to question him in an urgent whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did they do to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen had told her but she would like to hear it from George directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Blood-sucking King does way more than blood sucking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>George looked back and Zezi&#39;s heart skipped a beat that he was behind them. But that couldn&#39;t be right, he was long gone. Also, she would have noticed, although seeing her family had made her observation drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He almost took my soul. I could feel it dragging out of me. What is he? A demon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s face fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen had said he was capable of soul seizing this morning but it had slipped her mind till now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. He also wanted to turn Mira.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes went wide with fear. &#34;WHA--what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t. One of those mons--- the one you saw. The Bloodsucker who suspiciously wanted to take care of Mira. She came in with some bloodoath and said you did it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gwen.&#34; Zezi smiled instinctively, but that only made George frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something didn&#39;t sound right about the name but that wasn&#39;t his concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are all the same. One nice act doesn&#39;t change them. What was in that bloodoath anyways.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart squeezed with hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; She blinked away the tears that were quickly welling up in her eyes. &#34;I don&#39;t know yet, but I have a feeling it&#39;s everything. George--&#34; her hands cupped his face, studying him like this would be the last time she would ever see him again.&#34;I just came here to say goodbye to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And to Mira.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you saying?&#34; He asked with a sad chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now right? Just---&#34; his voice trailed off. &#34;No?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up slowly, looking down at her. &#34;My love, are you saying no?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at everything that is going on. The answer is obvious. This has to end. Besides, &#34; she stood up too, yet again cupping his face in her hands. &#34;This was never going to work from the beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words were heavy; they burnt her tongue and hurt her heart, but she knew a part of it held an undeniable truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very thing that was tearing them apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very thing they struggled with relentlessly till they decided to just live with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The paths of those two things would never find their way to become one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how hard they tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long will I continue to tolerate his abuse?&#34; Her hands dropped from his cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not me, you know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; her hand cupped his face, her glassy gaze holding his devastated own. &#34;I know. My George would never lay a finger on me but his wolf would rip me apart and sprinkle my blood on the dry ground, just for the fun of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My love,&#34; his hand moved over hers, and he pushed forward to reach her, his hand moving further down hers, but her grip was oddly firm, and she kept him in place. &#34;Please, don&#39;t cry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the truth, you know it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get better.&#34; The words rushed out of his mouth. &#34;I&#39;ll control him be--&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what you said before we had Mira. The same thing you said when we got her. Mira will be seven in a couple of months, you are still saying the same thing, George.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, his wolf was jubilating at the back of his mind right now, celebrating his possible freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This has to stop.&#34; She pressed her forehead against his, the saltiness of her taste filling her mouth. &#34;Goodbye, George. I hope you find your mate so you and your wolf won&#39;t do this again, and if you don&#39;t, I hope you find someone that you and your wolf will love. Someone who will be a wonderful mother to our daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away towards their daughter, who was still playing with her teddy; she was always so engrossed in her make-believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our Mira. Take care of her for me, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t say that, I can find a way to---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The sacrifice is too much. I almost lost my family because I was being unrealistic with myself. The only form of happiness you can give me now is to be happy with our daughter. Be alive and... Just live. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was in that Blood oath, my love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know it all, but for now. I know I must lose your mark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand shot up to hers on his neck, his eyes passing his mark on hers, noticing only now that it was fading, his observation making his frown deepen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what, carry his?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the Moon&#39;s sake, please George...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a blink, his eyes glowed red.</p>
