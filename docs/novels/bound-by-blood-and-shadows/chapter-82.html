                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t make Lady Zezi your Queen. With all due respect and all the formalities that I should have started with. Sorry about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, the voice was one that Zezi knew all too well. The light-heartedness of the aura it flowed with, the humour that was buried within it, and the way the calmness slipped through the shelf that she was hiding behind and floated to her ears like a gentle petal swayed by the breeze. There was no doubt in her mind that that voice belonged to Sir Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once since he had stepped into the Castle and she had seen him, this was the first time she would be wholeheartedly agreeing with something he said. She didn&#39;t know the reason why he had said that but what does it matter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her total agreement to the statement, she dared not speak. Not because she was afraid of saying it, she had after all made her intentions about this whole mate situation known to the King times without number, the only problem, was that, she was hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rushing up the stairs, she had been smart enough to hid her heartbeat and her scent as she was recently learning to do, when she sprinted into the library, she had been grateful that she had done that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her mind had told her, Akeem and his High Pillar were no where in sight. Alright, considering that she didn&#39;t even know how his High Pillar looked like, at least she knew Akeem and she knew that he was the Librarian. Tonight though, he had not been at his seat too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just the usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentle flipping of the book that Zezi persumed the King was reading, sliced through the silence, making her her press her back further against the Book shelf she was hiding behind. She had been lucky they had their backs turned to the door when she had sprinted in. Although an excuse would have readily slipped out of her mouth as to the reason for her presence here, but Zezi was avoiding them for three different reasons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One being that she wasn&#39;t sure if Akeem and his High Pillar had been here, but the King had captured them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second one being that, if they had not been here and the King happened to just be in the library by a huge coincidence, then she wasn&#39;t ready to face him yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tomorrow though, she would be ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The third one raced back to the fear she had, when she had first started talking to Akeem. The whole betrayal scheme could just be a test and the King could just be sitting there to see if she would come to the Library as per the information given to him by his spices, who were disguising as traitors of the throne - Akeem and whoseover that High Pillar was. That was even of the so called Gogh Pillar existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might just be sitting there, waiting to see if she had failed the test he set for here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe this would be the last snap, maybe he would finally lose it, give up all hope in her and kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever it was, there had to be reason he was here tonight and by this time. Zezi wasn&#39;t sure of what it was and she would definitely not allow herself to die upon an uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t something very &#39;Zetaly&#39; to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m waiting.&#34; The King&#39;s voice boomed and she shut her eyes briefly to concentrated on hiding her presence, fighting the distraction that the mate bond was trying to force into her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a battle to fight the urge of jumping out from behind this shelf and lurching herself straight into his arms, burying her nose in the croak of his neck, breathing in that earthy scent that only he possessed while she ran her fingers through his silky long hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah! This was terrible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the fights that used to be strong in her while she had George&#39;s mate had all vanished. All she was hanging to right now were her own restraints and every passing moment, they threatened to betray her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes was all her mind could think about and his lingering touch. Everything he had done on the Full Moon through her mind and the need to have it happen again made her hands curled into fists by her sides, as she recounted in her mind all the reasons why she should keep hating him instead of allowing this feeling to possess her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The uprisings, You Majesty.&#34; The bubbly voice said, followed by the slight and quick scrapping of a chair against the floor, back and forth. &#34;They have become even more and the only reason for this is because they know you have taken in a weaker breed as your mate. Many still have hope about the whole situation but when-- if you crown her as Queen, many of our kind will turn against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi bit her bottom lip as her brows furrowed in deep thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had thought the King didn&#39;t know anything about any uprising or revolution against him. Maybe this wasn&#39;t a trap after all. Maybe he had even captured Akeem and his High Pillar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Many of our kind respect fate.&#34; The King said with a calmness, like this was the most common knowledge and Oliver was even stupid to suggest otherwise. &#34;They honour the mate bond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver giggled sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get me wrong, Your Majesty. I&#39;m only looking out for you. See, how about this? You can serve both sides without having problems.&#34; There was a pause before he quickly added. &#34;Your Majesty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was dead silence and even the consistent rhythmic flipping that was expected right about now, stopped midway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you forgotten the rules that guide us, Oliver?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rules?&#34; Oliver said with a blah tone. &#34;Rules?&#34; He said with a slight chuckle, the chair moving a little against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he crackling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing his throat, he spoke, his voice sounding more serious than humorous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rulea are meant to be bent, molded and shaped, and who&#39;s better to made, mold and shape them, than you, your Majesty.&#34; His voice deepened with emphasis but still that humor made itself even more present within it. &#34;You make the rules, Your Majesty, and you may break them if you please, then make them into whatever you break them into right after or even later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a slight tapping against the table surface, and Zezi froze with each tap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may take more than one patner, no one will question you. No one questions the King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s heartbeat picked up and she forced herself to concentrate more on hiding her presence. It had never been this hard before, she could feel it draining her, her sight turning to blue ever so often before it switched right back to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was getting hard to breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t worried about who the King decided to get married to or take as his Queen, so why was her body going through all the stages of panic, sadness and anger combined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why wasn&#39;t the King talking yet?! He should be saying something already!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning down Oliver&#39;s proposal, perhaps. Not like that was why she wanted but...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart was pounding loudly in her head now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WHY WASN&#39;T HE TALKING YET?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should kill Oliver. Not because of what he said, she wasn&#39;t concerned about that, but a sick feeling in her made her want to have his head on a stick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may take Lady Delice as your Queen, she will rule, she is a vampire and she commands respect. The people love and honour her. It will show that you have the people at heart. You will satisfy the side that wants a good royal blood line to lead them.&#34; Then he sighed with a hint of laughter in his voice, that only made Zezi&#39;s blood boil even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t jealous. She would never be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the monster bonded himself with someone other than her, it would be good radiance. Hopefully he would let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t angry. She wasn&#39;t angry. It was the mate bond&#39;s fault but she still wasn&#39;t angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King wasn&#39;t hers, he could be anyone&#39;s but hers. She was only angry that this plan was still involving her with bonding with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why she was angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because of any other reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Certainly not!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sired her, and you are the strongest vampire we have. It will be a perfect match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The book flipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King was reading again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi blinked, feeling the strong wood digging into her back, her sight turning blue again from the thought that crossed through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he, perhaps, considering it?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flipping continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was starting to turtore her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, he could bare the idea of being bonding someone else for life asides his mate? Wow. Her kind would always be better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you will take the wolf as a concubine. Satisfy the side that honours fate. You will please all, be loved by all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi gritted her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver just topped her death list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would kill him first.</p>
