                <p>Zezi could barely stand the best morning, and when Gwen had busted in, bringing her food and wondering why her Mistress was so weak, she couldn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassment had rushed through her when she threw in a wide guess that she had spent the night with the King, saying she caught a whiff of an aura that was powerful than her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprisingly, Gwen had not pushed the matter or ask for details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not like she had ever done that before but Gwen sometimes acted like an excited teenager and it wasn&#39;t far-fetched that she could do something like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All in all, Zezi really appreciated less talking, her mind moved over how Lady Delice had brought her back here very early in the morning, saying that if she were to pass the night in her room while her room was perfectly fine, it might spike the King&#39;s interest. The least of the things they needed right now was for the King to be interested in whatever form of action they took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was already hot on his trials of the dens, to the point that they had to halt all their meetings for now, till things would die down, hopefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice had gotten the antidote from Lady Laura who had to come up with one as fast as she could, when she finally had no choice but to make it. She hadn&#39;t thought that it would be needed and she hadn&#39;t made one beforehand, although the White Circle had asked that it be done a long time ago. Something she assured them had already been done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All in all, Zezi had seen her life flash before her eyes last night, with her parents on the other side, their arms outstretched as they called her to come into the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had almost died!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever that thing was, it was really powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would need a whole day in bed to recover and that was after drinking all the antidote Laura had made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Princess had not been so happy with the disturbance lat night, she had been in the middle of something with her Ball of Sunshine, stepping out to them with heels, a robe over her and a whip in her other hand. She even had the nerves to ask if she could hold on to the effect of the poison for just a little longer, while they completed waht they were going at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, in a very long time, Zezi had been hurt by her lose of speech. She had a lot of words to say to the Princess and her bearded goat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words that up till now, she still hadn&#39;t been able to say, because she was just that weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I make you more soup?&#34; Gwen asked, no longer beaming with happiness that her Mistress was slowly accepting their King, but instead scared that she was sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terribly sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another smell of that soup and she just throw up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t look so good, Milady.&#34; she moved from one feet to another. &#34;I will inform the King of this at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s head moved to the side so fast, she felt something in her neck sharply readjust after a snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you won&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if Silas had injected something in you during the fight. Your scent is weak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you just trust me on this one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen shook her head instinctively before she nodded when Zezi had frowned at her action, then she sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was her Mistress doing this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she was in a state that she didn&#39;t wish the King seeing her in, because it was due to what Silas had done to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she ashamed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she shouldn&#39;t feel that way. None of what had happened was her fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be something mental?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her husband had a couple of times talked about the state of someone&#39;s mental health having such an effect. The one she wouldn&#39;t forget was the night their son had refuse to get out of  bed after his first rejection, and she had been panicking that their son had been struck down by some strange illness that might have no cure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you let me stay with you then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have already done that.&#34; Zezi sighed, leaning back into bed before she looked right back at Gwen in understanding. &#34;All day?! I can&#39;t let you do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you must let me tell the King. Let me do something. I can&#39;t watch you like this. You look like you are dying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certainly exaggerating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice had assured that the antidote would work but it will do a slow job and take a couple of hours before the poison is finally cleared out of her system. The amount she had taken being too much for her body and strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was glad it had numbed the pain first though. If not, she was sure the truth would have been out by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t even be able to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hoping that Gwen would just give up if she remained quiet, Zezi did just that, but the moment Gwen realized that her Mistress was intentionally stalling, she bowed her head and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. I will tell him right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did silence mean a couple of words here that she had no knowledge about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;G--wen.&#34; She called and Gwen stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, Mistress? Is there any other thing you would like me to tell the King asides the crumbling state if your health?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi rolled her eyes, but the action in itself was too painful that she stopped midway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t be possibly dying, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It just wasn&#39;t true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; She gestured, waving her hand in defeat. &#34;Stay with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen giggled, bringing the dressing chair closer while she pulled out a book from nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My little bats wanted you to have this. It&#39;s a story they wrote together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is a thank you for the stick figures we drew together. The drawing of my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, that! She had completely forgotten about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They liked it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi took the book from her and flipped it open to the first page.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is a drawing of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi wriggled her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can draw better than I can.&#34; At least, this drawing had a body to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen chuckled, &#34;She has a passion for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is this though?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You, Milady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi bursted out in laughter, ignoring the pain in her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No poison can stop her from having fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That drawing looked nothing like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But, alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I look really beautiful. Express my gratitude to her and all of them.&#34; She said admist laughter, I will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t tell them I found the drawing funny, I don&#39;t want to hurt their feelings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must. They did it to make you laugh and it will only hurt them to think that it didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was surprising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi sighed. &#34;Then tell them it lit up my day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen nodded, smiling herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making her children happy must give her joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Zezi missed her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Missed her so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall I read it to you, my Lady?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen cleared her throat and started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A long, long, long, long, long, longggggg, time ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is a lot of longs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen nodded, resting back in her seat. &#34;Exactly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This will be interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen stiffed a giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How would you know, Milady? You haven&#39;t even gotten to the best part yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, what exactly happened at the best part to make it, the best part.</p>
