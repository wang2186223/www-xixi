                <p>She tried to control her heartbeat, control her feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must stay in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing about this is fair.&#34;</p>

                <p>Relief settled in her chest like cold water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, he didn&#39;t know. There was no way he would have known of the poison and still made her his Queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, he would have thrown her into the dungeon instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing for her to worry about... except her daughter and everything surrounding the recent attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If my daughter dies, I will never forgive you. I won&#39;t let your kind take one more special person from me. Even if the guilty one is also death to yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am tired of this.&#34; There was resignation in his quiet voice, and without giving her a second look, he shut the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi was unmoved, at least that was what she had convinced herself that she felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t after an hour after he left, did she realized how stupid a move that had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should have hidden her feelings to get answers from him about the probable existence of the Volakys in the Castle, and of the former king, if he was still alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly, she sent Gwen to help her get Aunt Alice, so that she could take her place by Mira&#39;s bedside, while she went after Valerick to get answers to her questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen had not been her chatty self after the attack and Zezi was absolutely grateful for that at the beginning, until she began to worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did your family get home safe? Were you hurt?&#34; She had asked and Gwen had answered that her family was alright. She was only worried about her Mistress and her pup, and the whole Kingdom of Lavida.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Volakys are nightmares. We thought they were gone and we would never have to face them again. We thought this over.&#34; There had been shadows beneath her eyes, a hint of wildness and agitation consuming her aura. &#34;But there is no need to worry, our King will take care of everything and your little bat will be alright.&#34; Gwen had flashed her a smile, before letting out a horrified gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe they ruined your Joining Night! Those overripe bastards!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, there she was!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Gwen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that conversation, Zezi didn&#39;t worry about Gwen anymore, and they barely had any more conversations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door pushed open quietly, and Aunt Alice stepped in. It had been barely four minutes since she had sent Gwen to get her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That vampire moved quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;George has been through a lot.&#34; Aunt Alice said when she got to the room, &#34;Many treatments, many experiments, whatever he does please consider that he does it because he loves you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother, you don&#39;t know what I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aunt Alice didn&#39;t know the extent of George Wolf&#39;s abuse because Zezi was always lying to her about it, not only that, her quick healing abilities made it easy to hide. She didn&#39;t know about George&#39;s fated mate, something she had just discovered yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were just so many things about their relationship that her mother didn&#39;t know about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like she was now discovering that there were so many things she didn&#39;t know about Mira.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever it is, he has been there for you. That should be worth more than whatever that monster is providing.&#34; There was disgust in her motherly gaze as her eyes zeroed in on the fading hickeys that littered Zezi&#39;s neck, one that she had even forgotten about by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi made no attempt to cover it, instead, she chuckled dryly. &#34;They said our Mira might be part of those monsters we dread so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are lying.&#34; She nodded. &#34;I believe him, and if you could see the state of the Capital, you would believe him too. The Bloodsuckers only want to use us, they don&#39;t care how much it kills us. I know hearts can be complicated especially when the matebond is involved but no matter how easily swayed your heart has been for all those,&#34; she gestured to her neck and this disgust in her eyes this time made Zezi recoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warm, slightly wrinkled palms cupped her face. Words spoken with a gentle voice, redirecting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A monster will always remain a monster. Remember that. That monster is the King of them all, he will always choose his kind but George?&#34; she smiled. &#34;That boy will always choose you. Remember where you came from, remember where you are, and think about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she pressed a kiss to her forehead, brushing her hand over Zezi&#39;s hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>____</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fur, blood, and bodies littered the floor like fallen rose petals, twisted in ridiculous shapes with eyes as white as pearls; devoid of every black they should have in them, and flesh the color of bloodless veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the midst of it all, stood Valerick. Feral as his fangs dug into the neck of another prey whose screams rang through the lifeless hall, cutting off sharply before it could get anywhere. The black cobwebbed lines from Valerick had extended to him, draining away his soul, offering him a painful death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, the prey was tossed aside. Limp, soulless and lifeless, he joined the rest of the petals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A squeak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick&#39;s ears perked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was still one more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hunt that followed was quick and easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With mouth and claws dipped with blood, soulless black eyes, and a haunting aura that defined feral, Valerick watched his last prey as she attempted to scurry away. She whimpered and begged to be spared, but to those words, he paid no heed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Necessary casualties.&#34; His fangs made the words laborious, and in the blink of an eye, his trembling prey was in his grip. &#34;My sincerest apologies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fangs sank into the warm neck, this soul-seizing vampire was having his fill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bite he did, and drained he did, to fill a hunger he didn&#39;t even know existed to such depth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tossed his last prey aside, the rage that flowed through his veins was unmistakable and raw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maddening power he felt those ten years ago when he had killed his father.</p>
