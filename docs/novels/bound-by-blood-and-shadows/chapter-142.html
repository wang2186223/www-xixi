                <p>Pleasure tore down her barriers, and her eyes rolled back, but Valerick pulled his hand away from her before she could welcome it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A protest was on the tip of her tongue, before he spun her around and pushed her into the sculpture. He groaned with pleasure as he sank his veiny length into her wet, pulsating walls. The invasion made a silent gasp escape her lips, her eyelids fell shut as she struggled around his grith, and she clawed into the sculpture so she could stay on her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zezi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That pushed her towards the peak again, till his fangs settled a little too deeply against her skin, his claws dug into her thighs, and he warned, &#34;Not until I permit it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, no.&#34; Her climax became harder to fight now that she had been instructed against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand went in front of her, going around her neck and angling her chin, forcing her to look at him. While the other held her angled to him. He stared at her with devouring eyes, his teeth stained red with her blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Moon, why was he so beautiful?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pleasure made her stiff and she was tumbling into her peak again, but he slowed his pace and she cried, &#34;Valerk---please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is so close to you now?&#34; His voice sounded deadly, low with the force of restraint. &#34;That gun or I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valerick,&#34; her hand was against his now, hanging onto it, so she could breathe. &#34;pl--se let me---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. That gun or---&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears rolled down her cheeks, as she fought against giving in to the pleasure he wouldn&#39;t let her attain. &#34;You! You are fucking inside me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; Black lines moved over his face. &#34;It is I. I&#39;m closer.&#34; He pressed the words to the pores of her neck, his hand letting her neck go, as he tucked her hair behind her ears. His pace picked up too fast, leading her to a maddening struggle with a desperate plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come for me, Zezi.&#34; He sank his fangs into her neck, her warm blood quenching his thirst as she jolted against him, taut with the pleasure that wreaked her, as she fell limp against him, his name on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her blood and her soul, fed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another thrust and he exploded into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feral ecstasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were still in the hall and the smell of sex was thick in the air. Zezi was struggling to pull her dress over her without success, after cleaning herself up with a handkerchief Valerick had given her. Soon enough, she huffed in frustration, giving up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ruined my dress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valerick gave her a dazed look, as he wiped her blood away from his lips with his red handkerchief. His aura was still wild from drinking directly from a life source and not just that, his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could still taste her and he wanted more. Instead of going for what he wanted though, he pulled off his jacket and put it over her shoulders, covering her up. Leaving him in a black shirt and gold vest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your maid will bring you another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gwen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pursed her lips. She wanted to argue that she really liked this dress and she hoped that he would stop ripping her dresses, but she felt too weak and too sour to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although, she had not fainted this time, it still drained her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were a virgin,&#34; Zezi said breathlessly, tangling her fingers in her hair. She was too weak to keep standing, so she sat down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank the Moon the floor was clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you heard that.&#34; He shrugged, then smirked. &#34;I have been doing some research and I have a very good teacher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew he wasn&#39;t sleeping with someone else, but she was curious as to who that teacher was, and even though it felt stupid, jealousy bit at the edges of her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had better not be Irysi, Nicholas she could tolerate, as much as she hated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to ask, but he beat her to ask a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was it good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blushed. &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was crazy. This was ridiculous. What was she doing? What---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He settled in front of her, in all his distracting glorious presence. Her hand dashed forward, combing through his hair. He hummed with content, clenching his fists by his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he were to take her again, she would definitely faint this time. There was only so much draining her body could take, and he had a dangerously large appetite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With time, they would get better together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled away from him, feeling a little dizzy. Her hands pulled his jacket closer, finding his first rain scent that perfumed it, comforting. It felt good to feel him against her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we traumatized the sculptures. I don&#39;t think we should do this here again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again? Of course, again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll blindfold them next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled, &#34;You sound ridiculous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, &#34;I&#39;ll blindfold you then, so you won&#39;t see them. Is that alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence for a moment before they laughed, but hers dwindled first and she watched him, turning her decisions over in her mind, seeing a new opening. When his eyes caught hers, she looked away, staring back at the statue she had just been fucked against.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t right. This wasn&#39;t---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They belonged to my father.&#34; Valerick&#39;s voice snapped her out of her thinking. &#34;I have little care for them, but they are beautiful and very expensive. Good for the Kingdom&#39;s Treasury.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good reasoning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t shown me your mother&#39;s painting yet,&#34; she turned to him. &#34;Except that one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark appeared in his eyes. &#34;I will. All in due time.&#34; Then the spark died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You taste of it tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about his gaze changed, and suddenly she felt like he could see through her soul, and her deepest secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he knew them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your baby medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>___</p>
                
                
                
                <p>((All I&#39;m going to say is that they need to pay for that sculpture&#39;s therapy!))</p>
