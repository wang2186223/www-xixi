                <p>Besides, he was a vampire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must be just like the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you say about dinner? You and me? I think we&#39;ll get along very well, in fact, I can see the future.&#34; His hands formed into circles around his eyes, and he stared ahead distantly, like something was playing right in front of him as he hummed. &#34;Ah!&#34; He dropped his hands by his sides, looking back at her with that goofy smile on his face. &#34;The future says we&#39;ll be the best of friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, Zezi would be more than happy to disappoint that future. No way would she be a friend to a vampire, or even someone like Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just wasn&#39;t it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dinner sure sounds nice, but Zezi will be busy with me, and you&#39;ll be busy with the papers you still haven&#39;t turned in yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Papers, your Majesty? I&#39;ve turned in all my papers.&#34; He paused and his eyes widened with an idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi could almost see a lightbulb switch on over his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got it. How about a table for three?! It will be so much fun! We haven&#39;t had dinner in a long time! You, your mate, and I, what a perfect trio we&#39;ll turn out to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say yes, say yes, say yes!&#34; He started chanting, looking back and forth to Zezi and the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say y---&#34; his words cut short and he drew in a sharp breath, his smile flattering for only a moment before he regained himself and sighed with relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, you are too busy for a dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I. Am. Not. Busy,&#34; he shook his head. &#34;How many times do I have to tell you that I&#39;ve turned in all my papers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only person who wasn&#39;t feeling the dangerous tension build was Oblivious Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did he even become a Governor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t turn in everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did-- ahhhhh,&#34; he nodded, his smile wide, &#34;I am very busy, I did not turn in my papers, I didn&#39;t even turn in one of my papers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi frowned, observing quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had the King just used his soul-seizing powers on his friend?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of friendship was this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, it felt well deserved. Oliver felt pretty burdening with trying to force her into attending dinner with him. She would have said no and stood her ground without agreeing, but anyway, she preferred how things had been handled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The invite was off without her even lifting a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Also, she didn&#39;t know how important Oliver was to the King yet and she wasn&#39;t sure if rejecting his dinner invite would either help her with the mission she had on him or build obstacles along the way of her plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t even know how I have the time to stand-- I&#39;m so sorry, Zezi, but--&#34; he reached out for her hand but withdrew immediately, like he had been burnt, but a giggle bubbled from his throat. &#34;I don&#39;t want to have to miss this dinner but it seems I will. Sooooo, you and his Majesty should have fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So even though she was out of the horror of having to have dinner with this ball of Sunshine, he still somehow found a way to set up a dinner date between her and the King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time around, the King looked at her, adjusting his arms that were folded behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t miss me too much,&#34; Oliver ended with a goofy smile, turning away but Zezi was not lucky enough for them to be rid of his presence just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby Oli!&#34; Someone said from the end of the hall, and they all turned in that direction to see who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although, Zezi had no need for that. She already knew who.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, isn&#39;t that my &#34;Raaa&#34; Queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi frowned, looking at Laura, who carried Oliver up in her arms and spun them around while Oliver had his legs wrapped around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura was in a relationship? With Sunshine?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possibility of that had totally slipped her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you arrive, Oli?&#34; She asked, putting him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some minutes ago.&#34; He replied, standing on his toes to fix her hair, and adjust her jacket. &#34;Been training, unh. My &#34;Raaa&#34; Queen been keeping the fire burning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged, blushing. &#34;It&#39;s nothing. How is the Left Province.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fantastic enough for me to get a break. Woh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long will you be staying for?&#34; Her long fingers played with his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I&#39;d stay here forever if I had a choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was boring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi looked at the only other person here to see if he was just as bored as she was... and yes, he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should ask for her excuse now and just leave, but somehow she stayed, her mind not coming up with words and the feeling of having the King around was something her body was desperate for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So desperate she couldn&#39;t think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look so good, Oli.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s always a pleasure being your little eye candy, Raa Queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took everything for Zezi not to burst out in laughter at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was a Raa Queen anyway?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t help that anytime he said that, he tried to growl, moving his head forward and making his beard sway in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh Moon Goddess, please give her strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; another voice was saying from the Hallway. That gentle voice that Zezi was trying to ensure she didn&#39;t get too close to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lady Delice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like a shadow of herself, lacking that little aura of life that always made her different from the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her instilled indifference, Zezi couldn&#39;t help but be worried about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t feeling so good this morning and---&#34; her voice trailed off when she finally joined them and her gaze laid on Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zezi&#39;s eyes sparked with interest, recognizing the look in Delice&#39;s eyes before it vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did these two have history?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of history was it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they siblings? Best friends? Enemies? Rivals? Lovers? Exes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver, how---&#34; she paused when she saw Laura holding his hand affectionately and she smiled. &#34;It&#39;s nice to see you again, I guess. After all these years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Majesty,&#34; she turned quickly in a bow, paying her respect. She had been so shocked a while back by seeing Oliver, that she had forgotten to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing how put together Delice was, this only made Zezi more curious about who Oliver was to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as Zezi would love to stay a little longer just to watch what drama would unfold, the pain she felt right at her neck almost made her legs buckle underneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything felt so excessive today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling of the mate bond she shared with the King and the pain from George&#39;s fading mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gritted her teeth and forced a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;ll excuse me.&#34; She tried to make a move, but for some reason, she was scared that halfway, she might actually drop to the floor like a sack of potatoes if there wasn&#39;t any way she could get help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And me. Zezi and I have something to get to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about the rest of the meeting, your Majesty?&#34; Oliver called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow night,&#34; he said without hesitation, linking his hand with hers, and to deny the relief she felt was to deny an indisputable truth. It was just impossible. &#34;Leave us undisturbed, we&#39;ll be busy for the rest of the day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver hummed, and Zezi found a desperate need to correct whatever false thoughts that statement must have brought up in their minds, but she let it slide, concentrating instead on her steps; she wouldn&#39;t want to crumble to the ground while Laura was looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they walked away, Zezi could faintly hear Lady Delice taking her leave too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon she could hear Oliver and Laura coming their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with his arms around her, the pain hit her again like thunder, quaking through her, and she gritted her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The King made a move, his hand around her waist, to pull her up against him, but she voiced out in a harsh whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t carry me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, studying her for only a second, the approaching voices becoming louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, he flung the nearest door open, and pulled her into a small room, shutting the door firmly behind them.</p>
