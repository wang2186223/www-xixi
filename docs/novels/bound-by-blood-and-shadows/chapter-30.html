                <p>Her steps were determined and her eyes showed that no matter what they did, she wasn&#39;t ready to back down in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the men, their job was to keep the King&#39;s mate in the room, so they could let this slide. Besides, this was Gwen.</p>

The smell that hit her nose almost stilled her to a stop, a whiff of powerful aura that only belonged to the King.</p>

                <p>Things had gone wrong. Really wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around the room, her brain calculating fast, and then, out of nowhere, she was able to get her hands on a pen and paper. Quickly, she sat by the dressing table and started writing on it.</p>

                <p>It was of utmost urgency and importance that she did this on her Lady&#39;s behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would have to find a way for it to get to the King as soon as possible. Again, she reminded herself that she was only doing this for her Lady and the bit of conscience she had in her wouldn&#39;t let her do otherwise. She knew it wasn&#39;t her place to interfere, but she couldn&#39;t just sit by and watch disaster unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had little bats too and a mate, putting herself in her Lady&#39;s shoes; she knew that if she was the one who had to face this kind of situation, she would go mad and she would want someone to do this for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, therefore, the best she could do would be done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, a full stop was drawn at the end of the last sentence. She was done writing the plea, writing down everything that her Lady could offer that she believed might move the King enough to spare her Lady&#39;s wolf family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah. What would Lady Zezi do about all this when she wakes up and finds out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before getting lost in the train of thought, she restrained herself from thinking any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now was not the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she needed at this moment was to seal the deal with Lady&#39;s blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, she was by her bedside once again, holding Lady Zezi&#39;s dangling hand by her warm wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly her claws shot out, and she punctured the tip of Zezi&#39;s pinky slightly, allowing her blood to drop to the exact spot on the paper she needed it to be. There was no sign of pain from her Mistress, she looked as peaceful as ever. Also, once Gwen pulled her claw out of her punctured pinky, the bleeding hole sealed right up, dry blood that quickly turned black, left, staining the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still holding her wrist, Gwen mumbled some words under her breath. Slowly, the blood on the paper glowed, and something like a wrist chain made out of red light glowed around Zezi&#39;s wrist; Gwen moved her hand slightly, and the light dissolved right into her skin, fading away. At the same time, the blood regained its normal colour too, no longer glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, an unbreakable blood oath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making blood oaths was something every vampire could do, but not many made blood oaths for others. It was amongst the most powerful kinds of oaths. Besides the fact that it was binding for life, it could only be performed out of absolute and true willingness. Gwen had been scared that it wouldn&#39;t work but since it had, it only meant that her Mistress had complete willingness in her heart to do anything to save her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lady would thank her, her lady would be grateful, her lady would and to her with absolute gratitude, not minding the sacrifice she would have to make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Lady was selfless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Lady would be nothing but absolutely grateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if she wasn&#39;t?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, to hell with that thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warm feeling of her Mistress&#39; wrist caressed the inside of her palms. She was only now noticing how alive her Mistress looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made the mistake of taking in a deep breath, and immediately, the consequences hit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smell of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze darted to her Lady&#39;s wrist and her penetrating gaze became fixated on it. Her moving pulse, her visible veins beneath her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could smell her blood lingering in that air, and slowly, she dropped back to her knees, her grip on her Lady&#39;s wrist tightening by the second, her eyes slowly turning crimson, her claws sneaking out, and her fangs poking from the corners of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going primal fast, instincts guiding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Control was no new thing to her but for that moment, it seemed to have slipped right through her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Lady&#39;s blood would be sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her Lady&#39;s blood wouldn&#39;t be like the packaged ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vibration of life would still be very much present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved her wrist closer up to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would taste only a little, then she would stop, only a little wouldn&#39;t be able to kill anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadow her image cast against the wall, aided by the glowing light above, showed as her mouth widened the closer her wrist got.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hunger she could feel in her was primitive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gong from a distance snapped her right out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped her wrist with the speed of light, rushing up to her feet, her eyes wide with surprise at what she was about to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never slipped like that before. She was supposed to feed before coming here and she had skipped it upon hearing what had happened to her Lady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly sprinted away, putting the plea into the scroll container that she had intended to show her children that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no time for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason for the drum banging was repeatedly running through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judgment had been passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, the King had won his case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the seventh bang of the Judgement Drums, the execution would happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gwen could already hear the people cheering. Her hand tightened around the scroll and she sprinted right down the hallway, hoping with all her heart that she wasn&#39;t already too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the first three bangs, there was always a pause. A moment for the &#39;guilty&#39; to make peace with their fate and surrender themselves to their punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the moment Gwen was counting upon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That pause.</p>
