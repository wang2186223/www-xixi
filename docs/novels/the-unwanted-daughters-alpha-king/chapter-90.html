                <p>The wind howled around us as the cold air gave me goose bumps. I hated how dark it was, how cold it was, how quiet it was... I didn’t like it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What are we doing up here?” I asked, wrapping my arms around myself trying to keep the chill from seeping into my bones. “There’s no escape if they come up here looking for me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shifted back into his human form and grabbed clothes from a bag I hadn’t even seen him bring, quickly changing, before throwing some slightly warmer clothes at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Put these on.” He demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My teeth were chattering from the chill, so I didn’t hesitate to put the long pants on and a pair of socks and shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Where’s Rhys?” I asked, trying to get some or any information I could. “Is he still out at the pack hunt or is he one of the dead bodies on the stairs? Did they kill everybody they could or just the guards?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys told me if there was ever an emergency that put you in danger, we were to come up here and wait,” Ethan said calmly, or more like complete devoid of emotion... I wondered if he actually felt calm or if he had learned how to shut it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But why here?” I asked again. “There’s nowhere to hide... We’re just out in the open.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Have you ever been up here before Grace?” Ethan snapped at me “Because I really don’t think many people have since you have to climb that little ladder we took and pulled it up after us.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been calm and then snapped.... He almost seemed too calm about everything. Like maybe he wanted to get caught or something....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don’t know how long we were up there, but eventually Ethan started to pace, near the edge, looking out as if he was waiting for something. I asked several times if he saw Rhys yet, but he had stopped answering my questions a while ago, and the ones he did answer, he picked and chose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That woman ruined everything!” Ethan muttered to himself. He kept going on and on about something under his breath, but I couldn’t hear anything else until he said, “poisoning her was not a part of the plan!” And then again, a bunch of nothing I could hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What woman?” I asked curiously because whoever she was, he was cursing her every thirty seconds. “Are you saying that Kinsley was partially responsible for me being poisoned? And what plan?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan laughed. He literally laughed at me, and I began to not just feel scared, terrified...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, of course I am not talking about Kinsley!” Ethan laughed. “That girl is dumber than a box of rocks.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So Allison poisoned me, but what plan did she ruin? Surely, you did not intend to sit with me on the roof during an attack now did you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Of course it was Allison!” Ethan’s face darkened with the exclamation. “Your sister is too foolish for such things. I only work for Adrain!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my stomach drop. No, no, no. This could not be happening. He worked for Adrian, and I was stuck on a roof with him? I thought he hated Adrian and Kinsley... My own family betraying me again...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why are you doing this?” I ask, my voice shaking as I sunk to the ground, suddenly understanding why he had seemed so calm and devoid of emotion... He was the one who had done it. He didn&#39;t give a damn at all...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You didn’t really think I was your brother, did you?” He sneered. “I’m only someone who looks similar to you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why did you lie?” I asked, my voice breaking with the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So, you would trust me, obviously.” Ethan laughed. “It was all a part of the plan, sweet cheeks. I planned to get caught. Adrian and I had come up with a whole little backstory that you all bought so easily. Though, I must admit, you kept me in that prison a lot longer than I expected. But it doesn’t matter now. We are just minutes away from our destiny.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You used me.” It was barely a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yep.” He popped the p in yep. He had no remorse at all. “And soon I will deliver you back to Adrian and I will rise within the ranks”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, I thought I would die from a broken heart. I had been used all along. I had fallen for the family trap all over again. I had allowed him to take me to a secluded place and if Rhys was to come looking for me, this would be like the last place he looked. But he might not even know about the bloodbath that happened in his own home yet. But I didn’t want him to come home to a dead or missing mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My anger and feelings of betrayal surged. I hated him. I hated that I had let this man claim to be my brother. I hated that this man had tried to take everything good in my life again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Enjoy your last moments of freedom, Grace,” He said snidely. “Your taste of luxury is over.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A feeling of power began to surge with all my feelings. I hated them. I hated Ethan. I was NOT going back to the Blood Moon Pack. I would die before I went back there again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Attack!&#34; A feminine voice in my head screamed, and I didn&#39;t even have a chance to process that it wasn&#39;t mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body then began to change. My arm elongated, and fur grew before finally, my claws came out. For the first time in my life, I felt powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had never truly sought revenge before, but my anger was too strong for anyone to have even attempted to calm me down. I would win any battle I was placed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stared at me in shock at my sudden partial shift., but I didn’t hesitate. If he didn’t want to act like he had a heart, then I could help him with that... I clawed my way into his chest, his face frozen in pure terror. I then tore his heart out with no hesitation, blood dripping down my arm as I squeezed it in anger before shoving him off the roof and chucking the heart after him. Nobody was ever going to use me again. Nothing would stand in my way. Revenge tasted sweet.</p>
