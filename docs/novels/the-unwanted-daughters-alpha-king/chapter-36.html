                <p>I felt panic immediately incite in me, but I also felt angry and frustrated and worried for her. Whatever I said in the next few minutes would set our course for the whole rest of our lives. I had to play it cool despite the emotions raging inside me, but I must not have answered fast enough because she immediately began to write on the board again. She wrote the word or and then drew an arrow on a road and a picture of a girl with her head chopped off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held in the horror that I felt. I knew she had trauma, but after everything she still thought I would just kill her. And maybe the answer was, yes. She could be one of those creatures. Could I just let one of those things into my pack? Even if that thing was Grace? Was Grace using me as a way to infiltrate my pack and weaken me? Grace who was seemingly consuming my every thought?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed the board toward me a little more, bringing my attention back to the her that was right in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed the shirt I had gotten for it and slid it over her head before handing her the shorts and underwear and turning around to give her some privacy, even though it was the last thing I really wanted to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Although the deal is void now,” I said carefully. “I would never harm an innocent woman. And Grace, you are an innocent woman.” I took a breath before continuing. “If you wish to leave, I will personally make sure you have everything you need and everything you want, and I will ensure you have a safe place to go. You are free to go anywhere you please in or out of the packs control...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf howled in displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She should have the option to go if she wishes.” I tell my wolf. “I will not keep her prisoner like her old pack.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf huffs back at me before reminding me that she could be our mate, and we should tell her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She might be,” I conceded. “But now isn’t the time. I don’t think she gets it yet.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned back around to see Grace sitting back on the counter, lost in thought, brushing her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the brush without much resistance and began to gently comb through her knots. But the stretch of silence only grew longer, and I grew more anxious by the moment. There were a million things I wished to say, but none of them felt right in this moment and I couldn’t pressure her to stay no matter how bad I wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace,” I said when I couldn’t take it anymore, and placed the brush back in her hair. “I have some matters to attend to, I’ll be back later, okay?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small frown graced her face, but she just nodded. I didn’t wait for more; I knew she would never ask me to stay, even if I did think she might have wanted me to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way slowly to the dungeons. I took the long way, lost in my thoughts. I was so distracted. I had no idea how to approach anything that was going on. For the first time ever, I was up against an unknown that was actually a threat to my people. How much danger were we really in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded to the guards at the top of the stairs as I walked by them and made my way down to the musty dungeons. Cells lined the hall. We didn’t have a need for so many, but there was always a need for a few. Betrayal always runs high when you&#39;re at the top, and I was at the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few prisoners looked up curiously as I passed. They all looked fairly clean in their basic clothes. but there was an odor down here that said things may not be exactly what they seemed. The further back I walked, the worse it got. These were always the worst of the worst criminals back here. They weren’t treated with as much dignity, and the light was so dim it was a wonder anyone could see anything even with improved werewolf vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally reached the cell I was looking for to find Sawyer sitting in a chair just inside the bars facing our newest prisoner. The monster was now back in his human form, dressed in a pair of shorts and t-shirt. He was sitting on the ground with his knees up to his chest, chained to the wall at all four ligaments. The cuffs were so tight that they looked like they were cutting him slightly, but the chains were fairly long so he could at least adjust how he was able to sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cell had a cot and a toilet, and currently Sawyer and a chair, but other than that it was empty. There was only a singular blanket on the cot too despite the chill of the dungeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You know, this would be a lot easier, if you would just talk.” Sawyer prodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really hadn’t expected him to be down here, but I knew he couldn’t help himself once Leon had told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you a part of the Red Blood Pack?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How do you shift like that? Are you a werewolf or something else?” Sawyer tried, but huffed in frustration when he was once again met with silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I studied the guy in front of us. He had dirty blonde hair and sharp blue eyes. He looked to be no older than Grace, but I remembered when he was pulled out of the car, he had been covered in blood and mud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you hurt?” I tried, now entering the cell too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy didn’t look up, but I could sense he was a little fearful now that there were two of us in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s your name, kid?” I tried again. “The more you cooperate the easier this will go.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn’t so much as move a muscle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alright, this is not productive.” I sighed. “I’m going to check on Grace.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Grace’s name left my lips, the kid’s eyes flickered to me filled with worry...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace... You’re worried about Grace?” I asked, no longer interested in leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She’s my twin.” The guy said finally. “We’re both Lycan.”</p>
