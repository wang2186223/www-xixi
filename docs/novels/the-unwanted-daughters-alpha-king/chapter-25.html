                <p>I immediately released the hold I had on Caleb and straightened up. Leon, seeing what I saw, immediately jumped in to hold back a screeching, lunging, Caleb, and I saw someone out of the corner of my eye move to help him. To my surprise, we had a sizeable crowd watching the spectacle, but my eyes were only on one. I hated that I had lost control. I hated it more that I had lost control in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly straightened out my clothes and ran my hand through my hair. I needed to look as composed as possible for Grace. Grace who was cowering in the door frame, making herself as small as possible. Grace whose sweet big eyes were closed in fear. Grace who I could see shaking from head to toe because of something I did. I did this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Gracie.” I whispered as I crouched down in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her eyes and looked at me with a fear in them I wished I could ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s okay. You’re safe now. No one is going to hurt you.” I promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a questioning look as if to say, you turned on your own brother, you turned on your other brides, when will you turn on me? And that felt like a stab in the back that made me feel sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I won’t tolerate disrespect,” I told her, and she whimpered, looking away from me. “He will get what he deserves. You have nothing to fear.” But even as I said those words I felt like I was lying to her. She had no idea what respect actually meant. Her old pack seemed to have mistreated her, making her misunderstand the word, and my words of comfort, weren’t actually comforting at all. It was her own sister who had treated her poorly, and here I was from an outsider perspective doing the same to my brother. I wanted to slap myself for that one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gently touched her face after a moment and forced her to look at me, trying to get her to see the sincerity in my eyes. “You are safe, Gracie. It was just a scuffle. He did some horrible things he can’t take back. I handled it poorly. I will handle it right now. Trust me?” I pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated a moment before nodding, and I breathed a sigh of relief. I stretched my arms out to help her up and she took them looking gracious. She was clearly still frightened, but she seemed to have it under control, which was a start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we were both standing, I turned back to the sizeable crowd that had gathered and regained my Alpha King composure. I was not the man to be messed with, and brother or not, there would be consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned toward my brother, Leon, and another pack member that I knew as Jason. Caleb was still fighting to get out of their grips, but he still when he saw me paying attention to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Back for more, brother?” He asked with a laugh etched in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at him coldly, and his face fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Due to my brother, Caleb’s, repeated transgressions against your Alpha King and you Beta, as well as several other members of the pack, I have decided that a severe punishment is now necessary.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a murmur among the crowd as more people seemed to be joining to see what was going on. I opened the pack link so everyone could be aware of what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb laughed out loud, clearly not believing I would do anything of any substance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I hearby declare,” I continued loudly, “That Caleb Sonnett will have the choice to be exiled or have a lifelong imprisonment. The choice of his punishment is up to him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd let out a simultaneous gasp and Caleb looked at me in shock, he had never expected I would go that far, but I was the Alpha King, and he had threatened what was mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys, surely you can’t mean that.” Caleb tried. “I am your brother! Your twin!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And I gave you warning after warning after warning, Caleb. You should have heard me. You should have listened. You made your choices. Not me. I tried to help you. You chose not to stop. You had no remorse for the damage you’ve done to your so-called family. I should have done this a long time ago, but I chose to believe you could change. But you won’t. You made that very clear today. So, no more chances.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please Rhys,” He begged, the panic in his voice so real, I almost gave in. “I am your brother, and this is harsh to anyone. I promise I will do better.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’ve had chances,” I repeated. “I have given you ample chances, more than I ever should have. So, make a choice, or I will make it for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snuck a peak at Grace. Her face was pale, and I knew she was uncomfortable with what was happening, but she didn’t show it. She stood tall, her blonde hair pulled back into a tight ponytail, for once not falling into her face. I was so proud of her bravery that I almost forgot that we had a whole crowd around us as I stared at her. Key word, almost. And when I remembered, I forced myself to look away from her and back at my brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys, you can’t be serious. What am I supposed to do?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It is no longer my problem.” I replied. “If you can’t make a choice, I will make it for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You would use your Alpha power on me? Your own brother?” His eyes glowed with fury, and I could tell his wolf was fighting for control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes.” I said calmly, but coldly. “So, what is it going to be? Lifelong imprisonment or banishment?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And we were met with silence as the question hung in the air between us.</p>
