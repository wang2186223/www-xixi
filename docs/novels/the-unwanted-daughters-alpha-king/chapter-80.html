                <p>“It’s up to Grace,” rang in my head for several long moments. I didn’t want the pressure of this decision. I didn’t know what the right answer was. I could release my brother and then he could help us take down Kinsley. I mean, she didn’t know about him, right? He was supposed to be dead, kind of like me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to so badly trust Ethan... I had never had a true family. I didn’t have a mom who would give me hugs. I didn’t have a dad who told me he was proud of me. I didn’t have a sister that I could share secrets with. But I had the chance now to have a brother that could care and could help. We could rewrite our own stories...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I suppose it wouldn’t be a bad thing for Ethan to be released so he can help us take down Kinsley without us having to come to this place...” I said nervously, turning to look at Rhys as the word left my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys raised his brow, but nodded, nonetheless as Ethan stood up, the joy on his face almost irreplaceably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, it’s your lucky day, Ethan” Rhys stated loudly. “You can have your freedom. But this do not mistake our generosity for weakness. Let’s go get you settled.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I won’t let you down, Grace,” Ethan bounced on the balls of his feet with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know you won’t,” I smiled up at him, standing myself, ready to leave this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ll be watching you,” Ethan told Rhys as Rhys held the cell door open for us all. “You better not hurt my sister because if you do, you won’t like what happens.” Ethan threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can have you thrown right back in here at any time,” Rhys growled, and I placed my hand on his chest, instantly calming him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes at how easy it was to both rile Rhys up and settle him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were all chatting easily on our way back to the packhouse. For the first time in my entire life the conversation felt easy. I didn’t feel like I was trying super hard and we weren’t talking about anything actually important, we were just talking, and it was nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze though when I saw her in our path. She had to be stalking us now because why else would she be on the path from the packhouse to the dungeon? I knew I was new here, but I knew enough to know that usually nobody but guards were ever in this area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s wr-” Rhys started but the words died on lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys!” Allison called out when she was close enough. “Darling what are you doing out here?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We had business to attend to.” He answered coldly, wrapping his arm around me tightly. “What are you doing out here?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I was looking for you. What are you doing with her?” She sneered, looking me up and down in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, she’s my mate,” Rhys responded. “I tend to like hanging out with her.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled slightly despite myself. I liked hearing that Rhys liked to hang out with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, I can help you with business things,” Allison offered, but I was sure that she had never done an ounce of work in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m good, thanks,” Rhys tried to guide us around her, but Allison stopped us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys, I’m worried about your safety!” Allison tried desperately, her body colliding slightly with mine, but Rhys moved me out of the way before I could even stumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“My safety?” Rhys laughed, and I felt my brother inch closer to me and I was grateful. “I’m the Alpha King, which you seem to have forgotten.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But what if she shifts and hurts you Rhys! I can’t help but think you aren’t thinking clearly about this! She is a monster!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ENOUGH!” Rhys roared at her, letting his aura slip a bit. “Grace is my mate. I will not tolerate you disrespecting her! Do not challenge me or my decisions anymore or you will be sleeping in dungeons. Am I clear?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and scurried off back toward the packhouse. We followed at a slower rate, and Rhys began giving new orders to everyone. He gave Ethan a room in the packhouse on the 2nd floor. And he told Leon to set up patrols in the city to see if we could uncover any new information or any clues about what they were up to. We didn’t really think we would find anything, but it was better than being sitting ducks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once those things were complete, Rhys and I headed to our room to get into comfier clothes since we hadn’t changed out of our meeting clothes yet. I fought another wave of nausea as I remembered what was waiting for me out in the city... My own sister wanted to use me for nefarious purposes. I couldn’t help but feel sick every time I thought about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Can you keep me in the loop about the pursuit of Adrian and Kinsley?” I finally got the courage to ask as we both began to change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys looked at me in surprise but nodded his head. “Of course, Gracie. I don’t think it’s safe to keep you out of the loop at all. But as I said the other day, we are a team now, there are no more secrets.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay... Then I want to ask something else.” I said nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You can tell me anything, Grace.” He smiled at me, guiding me over to the bed and pulling us both down onto it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“When we do find them, I want to face them...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys didn’t hide his surprise, but he didn’t like horrified like I thought he would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Of course, Grace.” He agreed. “When we find them, you will be the first to know. And promise, you will get to decide their fate.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and curled up in the blankets. The nauseous feeling only seemed to grow, and I wondered if I was a bad person for wanting revenge on my own family? Did the darkness finally take over me? Was this what it felt like to be a monster?</p>
