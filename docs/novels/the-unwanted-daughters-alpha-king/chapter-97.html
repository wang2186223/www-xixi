                <p>As soon as the door behind Leon shut, Rhys picked me up out of my cozy chair and sat me on top of his desk. My eyes met his in surprise, wondering why the abrupt change in seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys? What are you doing?” I asked hesitantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn’t answer though as he pulled my hoodie off, and his mouth met my neck. I immediately shifted to give him better access, but I still didn’t fully understand what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys?” His name came out breathlessly, but my confusion was clear. “You shouldn’t be touching me like this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands began to run down the sides of my body, and I hated how I craved his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why?” He asked in between kisses. “Your skin is still ice cold; I’m just helping you warm up a little.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moaned slightly as he began to kiss lower, and lower, sending tingles throughout my lower belly, making me want more. No. Need more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped out of my stupor nearly as quickly as I had fallen for his trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But we have things to do. You shouldn’t touch me like this,” I repeated as my body shuttered slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And why is that, Gracie?” He asked, pushing me back so I was laying on the desk now as he proceeded to wiggle my pants off, so I was on full display for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Because I am a monster,” I told him, trying not to be affected by the things he was doing to my body, but it was getting harder and harder as his tongue flicked at my clit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tsked at me, and the look on his face didn’t show any piece of the resentment, anger or disgust that I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Gracie, look at me,” He said sternly, stopping whatever he had just been doing to my body, making me mis it already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reluctantly met his eyes with mine, unsure of what the point of all this was. I mean, there were people who I was sure were awaiting his orders, and we were doing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You are no more of a monster than I am. And if I am a monster, then I am glad to be a monster alongside you. You are kind, and caring, and a product of circumstance. You are not what has happened to you. You are so much more than the blood on your hands, or the things others have said to you or about you. You don’t even realize the power you hold over me. How I cannot breathe when you are not around. How you consume my every thought. How you have taken over the reins of my life and I never want them back. Without you, there is no me. And I almost lost you tonight. I keep saying that I’ll protect you, and then I let you down, time and time again. But this self-hatred, monster talk stops here. You are my Queen Luna. You deserve love and care and protection. My pack is my pack, but you are the most important thing in the world to me. And I will stop time any time you need like I am now. You deserve my everything. Let me give you my everything.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn’t wait for me to respond, and honestly, I’m not sure I could have even if I wanted to. He lowered his own pants and lined himself at my entrance, finding a steady beat. I gripped at Rhys’ hair, pulling it slightly as I arched up to meet his mouth whenever he slowed down. He teased my body, twisting my nipples, and changing his rhythm whenever he felt like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys, please,” I begged, no longer able to take his teasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The satisfaction he felt from having me beg filled the bond, but my senses were too overwhelmed to care. He found the sweet spot, ready to send me over the edge. I was almost there, I could feel it building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Look at me.” He demanded, and my eyes found his a little hesitantly. “You are mine, Gracie. Now and forever. The Alpha King’s mate, and refer to yourself as anything less, I will have to punish you. This moment we’re in? It’s so you know that no matter what happens, you are wanted by the Alpha King. And you will always have your place amongst the Alpha King. You, my love, you are the Alpha fucking Queen.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hit hard and then my orgasm hit harder. My body shook as ecstasy crashed through me as he kept pounding me, chasing his own. I knew the moment he reached his as he all but froze on top of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of us moved for a long few moments, both of us breathing heavily from our little moment of bliss. As I stared into his eyes, I knew he believed every single word he had said. And a large part of me did too as he brushed the hair out of my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Look at that,” He breathed, with a smirk. “It seems that my ice queen has finally warmed up a little.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a breathy laugh, unsure of what to say to him, knowing he meant it both in the way that I was no longer cold and in the way that he had broken through my cold thoughts about myself and melted them away. He had a way of doing that with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We should get dressed,” I whispered. “Everyone is probably waiting on us.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let them wait,” He answered, but pulled away, and pulled me up into a sitting position with him. “You are the most important person in the world to me, and we will not jump into anything till you are ready.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m ready.” I breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys raised his brows at me in question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I took enough resources today and it nearly cost us everything. For some it did cost them everything... I’m okay enough. I’m rattled, I’m scared, and I’m exhausted, but I’m alive. And I am your Luna Queen, and in that means I need to lock it all away for little bit, and be what they need, what you need.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride shown in Rhys’ eyes, and I felt myself blush. I was terrified of who I was inside, but Rhys was right. I needed to do good. I could make that choice for myself. I would not let myself become what they had. I would do better; I would be better. After all, there was no choice. This was my path, and I had to take it. But I had no idea where it would lead me, all I knew was that I was going, and for now, that was enough.</p>
