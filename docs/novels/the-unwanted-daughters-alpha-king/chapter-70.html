                <p>Grace’s face immediately paled as she pondered my questions, and I watched her squirm in her chair a bit as she fought whatever battle was occurring in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t know,” She answered finally, her voice shaking. “I didn’t feel anything, but I don’t know how else they would have known I was there.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guilt she had been feeling intensified, and I almost immediately regretted asking my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Even if they did ‘track’ you, it’s not your fault.” I told her seriously, moving to hold her as tears threatened her big blue eyes again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I just -” She couldn’t stop the tears that came, and I immediately moved, pulling her into my lap and running my fingers through her hair in an attempt to soothe her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You just what?” I asked her to continue when she didn’t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I just, I don’t know very much about the Lycan things. I never imagined myself even having a wolf, let alone a monster inside of me, yet that possibility seems more and more likely.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why are you so afraid of turning into your true self?” I asked, not fully understanding her fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t want to be a monster,” She sobbed, clutching at my shirt. “I don’t want to be the reason innocent people get hurt or die!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Gracie, just because you are a Lycan, doesn’t mean people will think you a monster,” I tried, regretting that I asked any of my recent questions since they just seemed to just make her more and more upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No one will love a monster. You’re the Alpha King, you can’t be mated to a Lycan.’ She argued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I regretted asking my questions. I hadn’t meant for her to spiral like this, or question our relationship again.  I reached over, and held her face gently, so she was looking right at me before saying, “Gracie, I don’t care if you are Lycan or werewolf. I don’t care if you are the Alpha and Luna’s daughter or the Mistress’s. The only thing I care about is who you are as a person. And you are strong and kind, and smart. And that is all I care about.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like she wanted to believe me, but then she shut down again. “You say that now, but if we unbound me, I fear your answer will change.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It won’t,” I kissed her forehead attempting to reassure her, “But I guess I’ll just have to prove it to you over and over again that I will love you for forever. I chose you, Grace. In this lifetime and every one after.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She giggled slightly into my chest, and I breathed her in. I was so incredibly grateful that she was safe and unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Come on,” I encouraged lightly, “You’ve had a crazy day. Why don’t you go rest?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated and I realized that she probably thought I was pushing her away again. The walk to our room was made in silence, but once we got there, I laid down next to her and began to just talk about my day till all the scary stuff happened. I wanted her to know the mundane of my life and I wanted to know hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited till she fell asleep and headed off to see Arlo. He was the first one to have run into Kinsley and Adrian. He was the one who had gotten hurt both times. I knew it was probably unlikely, but what if he was in league with them and that’s how they were ambushed? I trusted Arlo... But what if that had been a mistake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed and made my way into the clinic. Sawyer was running around, clearly in the middle of something, but the receptionist was able to take me straight to Arlo, I didn’t even have to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was laying in the hospital bed, still looking pale, but was now alert and oriented compared to the car earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey Arlo, how ya feeling?” I asked, trying to keep my emotions in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“A lot better, thanks,” He answered. “Look, I know how it looks, but I swear to you that I had nothing to do with this. I took Grace to the bookstore because she was so overwhelmed by the crowds are the stuff, and everything around. I knew the bookstore would be less crowded; I go there quite frequently. Grace was in my line of sight the whole time, I was looking for some books to help her with her reading, but I also wanted her to explore and find her own interest. I was looking at a book, when I think it was Kinsley, but I didn’t see a face, stabbed something into my neck...” He took a breath before continuing. “The next thing I remember is that Kinsley and Grace were talking, and I got up as soon as I could feel my body, and then Leon was there. Thank goddess because I’m not sure I could have gotten us out of there. I did a search of the store, and we headed out to leave, but that’s when Alpha Adrian ambushed me, and I fell unconscious again, and I don’t know what happened after that... The next thing I knew I was in the car and then I woke again here in the hospital.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thanks.” I told him earnestly. His story matched Grace’s which made me feel better. “I trust you. I’m just trying to figure out how they found her, especially so quickly. But take the rest of the day off and feel better.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arlo nodded, and I felt a little better after talking to him, but then the uneasiness returned and I found myself walking the familiar steps to the dungeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ethan,” I called out as I reached his cell. He was sitting on his cot with a book in his hand looking well, but I didn’t feel like entering the cell today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hi, no Grace today?” He asked, closing the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No. I have a question for you.” I told him seriously, and his face immediately got serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Could Grace be consciously or unconsciously linking with her old pack?” I asked after a long moment of me trying to figure out how to phrase the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She’s still bound, right?” Ethan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then I would say no,” Ethan answered after a moment of thought. “That would be nearly impossible, even for someone of her power.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Tell me Ethan, what exactly makes her so powerful? Why is she so unique that people are literally seeking her out? What does she offer that they want so freaking bad?”</p>
