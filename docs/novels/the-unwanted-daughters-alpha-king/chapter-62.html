                <p>I woke up feeling exhausted. A glance at my window and I realized that I had slept much longer than I usually did. The sun was completely up, it had to be close to noon. I stretched my body, but to my surprise, the spot next to me was empty. I didn’t know if I was relieved or disappointed that he wasn’t there this time when I woke up. He had been there every time during the last few days, but they had been wild and freeing. Now, I felt myself again, and I couldn’t help but feel slightly embarrassed for what had happened over the last few days. I had never done anything like that before, and my body was feeling it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything hurt. I laid in bed for a while before deciding a shower might make me feel better. I got out of bed slowly as my muscles screamed in protest. Muscles I didn’t even know I had hurt. I couldn’t help but wonder if Rhys was here would he kiss the pain away or if I was supposed to be grateful that I felt like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned the water on, and let it warm up as I undressed myself bit by bit, my limbs weighing me down heavily. I stepped under the water and let it hit me for a few minutes. I felt my body relax with every minute that passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace?” I looked around as I tried to figure out if I was imagining Rhys’ voice or if he was actually calling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace?” He called out again a little more frantically and louder as he opened the bathroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Here.” I responded, realizing he was in fact real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed in relief and immediately began undressing before opening the glass and sliding in behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Was that necessary?” I asked but couldn’t help but lean into his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Absolutely,” He answered, his voice husky. “Have you washed up yet?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No.” I breathed as his fingers traced my sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then it would be my honor,” He whispered in my ear, grabbing the shampoo from the shelf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You don’t have to.” I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Shut up and let me take care of you.” He growled softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned into his touch, letting his fingers work their magic as he massaged my scalp, and my face flushed at the memories from the last couple days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s wrong?” Rhys asked, stopping his massage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Nothing.” I squeaked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You have nothing to be embarrassed about, Gracie,” He breathed in my ear. “You are beautiful, and I had a great time.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled as I leaned my head back under the water to rinse the shampoo, and he began to soap up my body. I couldn’t ignore the tingles his gentle touch sent through my body. There was nothing super sexual about it, but I found it heavenly just the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally finished helping me, he turned the water off and grabbed my towel, wrapping me up in it before wrapping one around his waist and picking me up and placing me on the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How are you feeling, Gracie?” He asked gently as he stared at me intensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m okay.” I told him. “I feel better now, but still a little sore.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded and caressed my face for a moment before pecking my lips and disappearing to the other room, I assumed for clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to follow him or not, but before I could even make a decision, he was back, clothes for both of us in hand. I hopped down off the counter, and we dressed silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you remember your childhood, Grace?” He asked after a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. That was random...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, not really.” I told him honestly. “I remember bits and pieces, but most of it feels like a blur. Even my clearest memories aren’t that clear. I just really didn’t have a memorable childhood, I guess.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hmm. I have to go see Ethan, would you like to join me?” Rhys asked as he took the brush from my hand and began to gently comb through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze. Did I want to see Ethan? Not really. I didn’t have a strong desire to see him. I didn’t know what to think when it came to him. All I felt was confused. But the way Rhys was looking at me in the mirror told me he wanted my answer to be yes, so yes it would have to be. I mean, after all he had catered to my needs for the last few days, I could do this for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, and Rhys reached out his hand and I took it graciously as we began our journey to the dungeons. The dungeons here, at least the ones I had seen were much nicer than the ones in Blood Moon pack. Each cell tended to have the necessities and were clean. They also weren’t quite as cold as the ones I was used to, but I still didn’t want to spend any more time than I had to down there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan was asleep when we got there. For a moment I just stared at him. He did look vaguely familiar, but what were the odds we were really twins? What were the odds that both Rhys and I were both had a twin and yet we were made for each other? They couldn’t possibly be very high...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rise and shine,” Rhys sneered as he rattled the cell bars as he entered, pulling me in behind him as a guard rushed to bring us each a chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did have to admit, Ethan looked healthier now. I was glad Rhys was keeping his promise to me that he wasn’t hurting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“To what do I owe this pleasure?” Ethan asked sleepily, but as soon as his eyes met mine, he sat up, immediately more alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I have more questions.” Rhys grumbled as we sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What do you know about witches?” Rhys questioned; his voice carefully controlled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Witches?” Ethan frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, witches.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know they exist, but not much more than that. I’ve never really interacted with witches. In fact, I’m not sure I’ve ever met one.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also frowned. Witches? What did they have to do with anything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you know if any ever interacted with Grace?” Rhys pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interacted with me? I didn’t know any witches... What was Rhys getting on about and what did it have to do with me???!</p>
