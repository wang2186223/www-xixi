                <p>I woke up feeling rested and at peace. Alpha King Rhys had walked me to my room after our conversation in the office. He had sat in the chair till I fell asleep. I don’t know when he left, but I still felt his presence lingering in my room. I closed my eyes and breathed it all in. I was safe here. No one was going to come grab me from my bed. No one was going to beat me for sleeping. I didn’t know what I’d done to deserve this, and a part of me didn’t think I did, but I’d enjoy it for as long as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I untangled myself from the blankets, and slowly got out of bed. Alpha King Rhys had told me we would be training today, but to sleep as long as I’d like. He would work in the office until I was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed a pair of leggings and a tank top and made my way to the bathroom. There was no point in showering if I was just going to work out, so I just changed my clothes and ran a brush through my hair, pulling it to the base of my neck in a low ponytail. I pulled my shoes on and I was all ready to go when I noticed the breakfast tray just sitting on the dresser. With a moment&#39;s hesitation, I realized that I was in fact quite hungry. I grabbed the bowl of fruit and gobbled it down. I didn’t want to eat a ton before working out, but I also knew my body needed energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I made my way to Alpha King Rhys’ office. I knocked once and heard his now familiar voice call out to come in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hi Grace,” He smiled slightly. “Ready to go?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, feeling uneasy now that I was here with him, making it real. I had never trained before. I had never exercised in the slightest. I would have died if I had tried. I know my sister would have never allowed it. She wanted me as weak as she could keep me. But I wouldn’t be that girl anymore. I was becoming the real me more and more every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up and stretched. His shirt lifted slightly, and I caught a glimpse of his perfect abs. Abs. Just abs. Not perfect. Come on, Grace. You can’t think of him like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached his hand out to me, and I hesitantly took it. I couldn’t help but admit that I wanted to never let go. My hand was so small in his, but it made me feel safe. Like maybe, just maybe, I belonged here, in this moment, with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The training center was intimidating. There were people everywhere. Noticing my sudden apprehension, Alpha King Rhys shouted, “CLEAR THE ROOM.” Everyone scattered. No one even bothered to grab their things, they just took off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Alpha King Rhys in awe, and I could tell he was trying to suppress a smirk. I rolled my eyes at him as he lead me to the gym mat in the middle of the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let’s go over a couple of ways to safely break out of grabs.” He stated, but I didn’t miss the once over he did of my body before grabbing me from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze. His grip was tight, but I knew he wouldn’t harm me. But there was something else. Something more. I wanted his hands, everywhere. I wanted to be locked in his embrace. I wanted his lips on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Trust your instincts,” He said, his voice so sultry that I could barely function. “Get out of the grab.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his arms around me, I couldn’t focus. I could barely breathe. I was stuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Come on, Gracie, get out of the grab.” He prodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn’t. I couldn’t do this. Not with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually he let go of me, and I immediately made my way to the bathroom without a word. I had to get out of here. I couldn’t do this. This was not me. This was definitely not me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh god what have I gotten myself into by agreeing to stay to be his companion, his partner? I couldn’t stop my thoughts. I wanted more than he could give. He didn’t want me like that. I was just an obligation. But my god, did his touch feel right. And that warm feeling in my belly, I needed it to go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace?” I heard him as he knocked on the bathroom door. “Are you okay?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. No. No, I was not okay. Not even a little. How could I possibly explain to the freaking Alpha King that he couldn’t touch me or I was going to lose my mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the door a smidge and peeped in making eye contact with me. He did a once over my body again to make sure physically okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace, hunny, it’s okay. I can help you release your emotional needs if you want.” He said gently, but there was something else there, a longing, maybe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn’t say anything. I was so embarrassed and ashamed of how I was feeling. I shouldn’t feel like this. I was losing my mind. But a part of me, a large part of me, wanted to take him up on his offer even though I felt crazy by it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s your animal instincts causing you to feel this way, and if you keep ignoring it and pushing it away, you’ll continue to feel more and more distressed and maybe even a little angry.” Alpha King Rhys rationalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I felt even worse about my reaction. I didn’t want to be so out of control. I couldn’t do this. I tried to close the door on him, but he stuck his foot out, stopping me. I slowly backed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace, it’s okay. It’s all natural. I know your underwear is soaked, and you have this driving desire for me to touch you. I know how bad you want it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept backing away slowly as he stalked toward me. Why was I running away from something I wanted so badly? Because he is the Alpha King! I reminded myself. But my god, the way he was walking toward me, I wanted him. And I wanted him now!</p>
