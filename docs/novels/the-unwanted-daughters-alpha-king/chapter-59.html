                <p>“I did.” She answered with a smile. “I met some new people, and I was glad that both Alana and Sawyer were there because that made it less scary.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m glad, my love.” I told her, running my hand through her hair. I loved how long it was and how she never stopped me from touching it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys?” Sawyer seemed hesitant as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I got a call from Caleb today.” Sawyer said, and I could tell he was nervous to tell me. “He just wanted to let us know he was safe.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed. I didn’t want to think about my other brother. A part of me felt bad for the way everything had gone down, but the other part of me just wished he would have heeded my warnings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m glad to hear it.” I said carefully. “You know I didn’t want to do it, Sawyer, but I have my reasons for it...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know.” Sawyer answered, but there was a sadness in his voice that made me feel for him. “I just miss him”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Me too.” I responded honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We laid there in silence for a while. I knew that Grace was still upset over some of the things that had happened today, but we didn’t talk about it. There was no need to ruin such a good moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we laid there, a sweet aroma began fill my senses, making my wolf crazy. Grace moved closer, curling her body up into me completely. I looked down at her and noticed her cheeks were flushed, and then I made eye contact with Sawyer whose pupils were slightly dilated as he looked at me with wild eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She’s in the heat,” Sawyer mindlinked me, standing up and bolting into the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s wrong? Where is he going?” Grace looked up in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How are you feeling?” I asked ignoring her question as she squirmed against me slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t know.” She answered hesitantly. “I feel kinda like hot and uncomfy.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Come on,” I got up and lifted her into my arms. “Let’s go to our room. I think your starting your heat.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whimpered in my arms, and I could feel both her nerves and her desire rolling off of her in waves. I prayed to the Moon Goddess that nobody would be in our path as I all but ran to our room. I didn’t need unmated males swarming my girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s okay.” I soothed as I threw open the door to her room. “I’m going to take care of you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But-“ She started but was cut off by the cramps that were starting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Shhh let me help you,” I laid her on the bed and pulled her hair out of her face. “I’m your mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please, Rhys,” She pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stripped my shirt off as she impatiently ripped at her own, yanking it over her head and then she kicked off her shoes. I then helped her with her pants, pulling them down. I admired her beautiful body that laid naked in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You are gorgeous,” I muttered as I leaned in to kiss her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met my kiss with a hunger I wasn’t quite prepared for. She was being bold, and I couldn’t say that I didn’t like it. I pulled away, capturing her neck with my mouth, right where my mark was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ohhh,” she moaned, arching her body up to meet mine. I then slipped one of my hands lower and slipped two fingers into her with ease and began thrusting them. She was already so wet, so ready for me. She was mine, and that would never change. Fate made her for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already on the edge of her first orgasm as I moved to show her breasts some attention. I captured her nipples in my mouth, and her hands raked through my hair as her body shuttered with her first orgasm. But we were just getting started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her only a moment to relax and rest before starting up again. My tongue circled her clit. Her body was so sensitive as I pulled my hand out, pushed her thighs apart and lined my dick up at her entrance. She cried out in wanting when I took too long, again, arching her body to give me better access and in a way to touch more. Her hands then ran up my side, sending shivers through my soul and I began to rock my hips into her, and she started to match my rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh Rhys,” She cried out, her eyes closed as I captured her tits with my mouth again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace,” I groaned as I felt myself growing close to an orgasm. “Cum for me my Grace.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moaned telling me she was also close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Who do you belong to?” I asked her,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You.” She panted, trying to pull her body away, but I held her firmly in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Who is your mate?” I taunted again, slowing my pace a bit causing her to cry out again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s you, Rhys!” She cried, rocking her hips, trying to get me to speed up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked and picked up my pace again causing her to squirm again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And who’s name are you going to scream as you cum?” I asked because last time she hadn’t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“YOU!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I engulfed her boob again, as her thighs tightened against mine. “Oh goddess!” She whined, and I knew I was making her feel good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel her walls start to clench around me, and all it took was two more thrusts and we were both over the edge, and she was screaming my name.</p>
