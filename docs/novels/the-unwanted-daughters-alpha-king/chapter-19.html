                <p>I woke up slowly. It was rare to have such a peaceful sleep, or to even wake up in a way that was not abrupt. I tried to move and realized that I couldn’t. I opened my eyes and realized that Alpha King Rhys’ arms had me locked in against his very naked body. Oh god. What if he touched me like that? What if he was just like every other person I had know in my old pack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re awake.&#34; His chest vibrated against my chest and his voice was husky with sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him, as he gently ran his hand through my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How do you feel?” He asked, turning me toward him more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. I actually felt okay, but I was so confused. Why was he holding me like that and so calm about it? But he reluctantly let go after a moment and got out of the bed, and I immediately missed his warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed the chalkboard and drew a question mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Don’t worry,” He teased in a manner that surprised me. “If I had done anything, you would know.” And then to top it off, he winked at me before continuing in a more serious tone, “You’ve actually been unconscious for several days now. No doubt a reaction from the mark you carry. You were fevering really bad, but when the fever broke, you had the opposite problem. You got really cold, and your breathing got weird, and I thought body heat might help you warm up, and it did.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. I was glad to know that nothing had happened, but I also could tell that despite his calm demeanor about it, his patience was waning. He held back this time, but would he again? What if I was never ready? Would he be the reason I was unconscious for four days next time? Or worse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Since you’ve been unconscious for four days, you probably desperately want a bath.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded a little uncertainly, unsure of what it was he exactly met by that, but I could feel the dried sweat from my fever stickily coating my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I was being lifted from the bed, and carried into the bath, my chalkboard still in my hand, and I gasped in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drew a question mark quickly, though it looked a little funky since we were moving. I didn’t even have the chance to show him before he was sitting me gently on the side of the tub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“If it isn’t blaringly obvious,” He said, as he turned the water on for the tub. “I am running you a bath. “Do you like your water super-hot, hot, or lukewarm?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held up a 3. I had had enough boiling water on my skin to last a lifetime. I grabbed my chalkboard, and tried to figure out how to tell him I could do it alone. I drew myself and then I drew a door with him on the other side. And then I wrote “I’m fine.” I did know how to spell both of those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked slightly but ignored me. He pulled at the hem of my shirt, looking at me for permission. Whatever he saw, apparently gave him the answer he wanted as he pulled my shirt off. I was surprised at how gentle he was, but I hated being exposed. I hated how ugly my body was, how scarred it was. My old wounds were still so painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands were then on my hips, tugging at my waistband, and I moved allowing him to take them off. Despite my whole body being on display for him, he surprised me by keeping his eyes locked with mine the whole time. Once I was fully undressed, and very uncomfortable, he lifted me into the tub. I once again was surprised at his tenderness. I wondered if I would ever truly be used to kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Everything you need should be on the ledge,” He stated backing away from the tub. “I will be downstairs. Come find me when you&#39;re done.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, but his back was already turned from me, so I knew he hadn’t seen it. I used the time I had alone to quickly wash up and process what was happening. The Alpha King was someone who seemed so intimidating to the outside eye, so I was thoroughly confused with what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly got dressed, combed my hair, and I was out the door, so I wouldn’t keep him waiting. I was on the stairs when I very nearly ran straight into The Alpha King’s twin, Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ohh, I’m sorry,” He stated with a little smirk as he threw his arm around me, pulling me uncomfortably close. “Didn’t mean to get in your way little Goose. How are ya doing? I heard you had a rough few days through the grapevine.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned and tried to pull away. Why was he calling me Goose? It wasn’t like I knew him well, and I had no idea how to even react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What are you doing, Caleb?” Doctor Sonnett asked, and I had never been so relieved to see him before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Just chatting with our dear brother’s special bride. But what makes her so special?” He stated, winking at me. “The way he acts you would think she was the one he’s been looking for.” “Knock it off,” Doctor Sonnett snapped at his brother who finally let me go. “Come on, Grace, Rhys is waiting for us in his office.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, and the three of us headed down the stairs together, but the brothers bickered amongst themselves, but I could hardly hear them, it was just muffled noise to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Sonnett knocked on the office door of what I assumed was the Alpha King’s office, which was confirmed when I heard his familiar voice call out, “Come in!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped in his office and saw that his Beta was sitting in the chair across from him, and there were several other chairs around, making me think they might have recently just concluded a meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace, glad you could join us,” The Beta smiled gently at him, I remembered him vaguely from that day the Alpha King had come to my old pack. He had driven us here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, feeling uncomfortable in a room so full of men, especially with the way Caleb was staring at me blatantly in front of his brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So, Grace,” The Alpha King started, “We have decided to go back to your old pack.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with those few words, they incited panic immediately.</p>
