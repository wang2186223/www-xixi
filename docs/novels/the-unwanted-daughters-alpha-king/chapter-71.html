                <p>Ethan stared at me for a long moment. I knew that I wasn’t hiding my frustration with everything well... Or at all. And to me he was the only one who could really give me any information, but he seemed about as lost as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Honestly,” He started, but I could see the worry on his face with my question. I hadn’t told him that Grace had had a run in with Kinsley, but I also knew with these questions, he was starting to piece things together and was worried like I was. “I don’t know specifics. Everything I have gathered has been gathered second or third hand information, and a lot of digging, and through books and folklore. None of it is known to be for sure true.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But what do you know?” I tried pleading for anything that could help me protect my Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Just that she must be extremely powerful for Kinsley and Adrian to go through so much trouble to neutralize her... They would have to be quite scared I think to go through such trouble to even maybe get their hands on her.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But how did they know she was near?” I asked, running my hand through my hair frustratedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She’s safe now, right?” Ethan asked, ignoring my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I debated giving him an answer, but decided that if I wanted his help, I thought it was only fair to give him some information if I expected him to help me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She’s resting right now. She was lucky to get out of there unharmed.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You know I’m trusting you to protect her... And you’re not doing such a good job...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m doing my best with the information I have.” I snapped at him. “And you are in no position to talk about protecting her considering you got caught and are in a prison cell.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan glared at me, but we both knew it was the truth. He had struggled to protect her for far longer than I had even known about her existence, let alone fallen in love with her. I had to give him some credit, he had kept decent tabs on her, and he had done what he could as a child. He had been right before, there was no way he would have been able to get her out of there safely and then protected her from rogues. They seemed to keep too close of an eye on her and were going to much further lengths than I ever expected them to so they could get her back. I think the only reason they had let me take her out of their pack was because I am the Alpha King. They didn’t see a choice and used her as leverage. They never thought I would keep her...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait... They never thought I would keep her. They probably still thought I didn’t want to keep her. That I wouldn’t care if they took her back. They still didn’t see that she was so much more than whatever they were trying to keep hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I understand that Grace shouldn’t be able to reach out with her Lycan since she’s bound... But could they reach out and sense her?” I asked cautiously, unsure if I was ready for the answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan pondered the question for a moment, before saying, “Theoretically, no. However, she is clearly a powerful Lycan. Even bound, they are terrified of her and what she can do... So, it would seem that some of her abilities might be, for lack of a better term, leaking through making it so they could sense her, but since she isn’t necessarily connected to that piece of herself, she couldn’t sense them. My guess though is that they would need to be nearby to sense her though.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So, you think they were just waiting for her in neutral territory just waiting for us to get comfortable to attack?” I asked, my stomach sinking with the thought. I hated that I had left her even though I knew she had fallen asleep a while ago, and there was nothing more I could do for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I think it’s possible,” Ethan shrugged. “But I also think it’s just as possible that you have a spy in your pack.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to fight the urge to fight Ethan at his words and was glad that I hadn’t allowed myself to enter his cell today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I do not have a spy.” I ground out. “My pack is loyal.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan raised his arms in surrender, but his next words told me that he didn’t really believe me. “I think most are, yes. But I think its folly to think that every single person in this pack is. I mean, Grace is new. Grace is Lycan or even wolfless to some. They don’t really know her. You’ve been a heart throb for ages. Even I as a rogue have heard stories of girls fawning over you. I’m sure somebody out there could have a big enough motive to want Grace gone. And whoever it was could have easily tipped off Kinsley or Adrian, telling them that you weren’t going into the city with Grace. They could have followed them out of the pack themselves. Followed at a distance, saw the prime opportunity, and told Adrian and Kinsley where Grace could be found. I don’t suppose it would have been terribly hard on any account.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I contemplated his words. They made a lot of sense. My pack didn’t really know Grace. They had always welcomed every new bride though... Hadn’t they? They had never seemed to care who they were before, but maybe I had been too blind in my disinterest to notice. Maybe there was more going on in my pack than I realized. I was going to need Leon to check surveillance of the border today and give me a list of every person who had come in and out and when.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Next to no one knew that she was going to the city.” I tried to argue even though I was hesitating a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Then the person you’re looking for might be even closer than you think.” Ethan answered easily, giving me a look that made me think maybe he knew something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the only people who knew were Leon, Sawyer and Arlo... But again it had been Arlo’s suggestion... Arlo was the only one who was hurt and who they threatened to take. But Arlo’s story had matched Grace’s so perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I have already confirmed those that knew of the outings loyalty, but thank you for your suggestions,” I said vehemently. I was not going to go around doubting those I trusted most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I meant no harm,” Ethan sighed. “I just want what’s best for my sister... If you let me out, I can help you keep her safe.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry, but no. Not until I know Kinsley and Adrian’s true intentions. You’re safer here, and so is Grace.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan sighed but seemed to accept my answer at least for now. I turned to leave when he called me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What?” I asked in irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t know if it’s relevant, but legends say that there is more than one way to create a Lycan... They say you don&#39;t necessarily have to be born one... And I worry that maybe the legends are true...”</p>
