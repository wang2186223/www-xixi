                <p>Mass Lycan creations? How could they be so evil? Those poor people who were just trying to live their lives, suddenly thrust into the darkness of being a Lycan... They had no idea what they were suddenly in for, but they probably at the very least knew it wasn’t good...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grace.” Rhys brought my attention back to him. He always seemed to know when I was drifting too far. “Adrian and Kinsley have malice intentions. What they are doing has nothing to do with being a Lycan. And everything to do with them being shitty humans.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled slightly at his direct words. He knew exactly where my head had gone, and knew what I needed to hear, even if I didn’t quite believe it yet. I mean, maybe I could, Ethan didn’t seem like a bad guy, and he was Lycan... That meant not everyone could be bad like Rhys kept telling me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“There’s that smile I love,” Rhys smiled down at me. I know there more people in the room, but it really felt like it was just us for a moment. “I promise to protect you, and I will make sure we capture Adrian and Kinsley, putting an end to their reign of terror.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know you’ll try.” I answered and he pecked my lips as a silent promise too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So, love birds,” Sawyer cut in, interrupting our little moment. “Can I examine the Luna to make sure she’s okay or no?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys let out a forced chuckle and smiled and blushed slight at being called Luna for one of the first times. I couldn’t remember if anyone had said it before, but now it was kinda true. I was in fact his mate now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You have the worst timing,” Rhys grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swatted at Rhys playfully. “He has to check me for brain damage.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How do you know that?” Rhys asked in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I heard you guys talking about it,” I admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, the fact that your memory seems to be intact, you can talk and tease my brother, I’m not very worried at this point, but I do want to do an official work-up and make sure there’s nothing we should be worried about.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys kicked everyone out of the room, so Sawyer could run his tests. He showed me shape flash cards, asking me name things. He made me touch my finger to my nose, and stand on one foot. I felt ridiculous each and every time he asked me to do something, but I was glad it was him and not a stranger watching me be ridiculous because I was not sure I could have handled that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, I don’t see anything that truly concerns me.” Sawyer said as he wrote down my test results. “I just want to run some blood work and make sure all the poison is out of your system and not making your numbers do funny things, but otherwise, I see no reason to keep you here, you are good to go once I draw your labs.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at Rhys. It was so easy to smile at him these days. I remembered the days when it was hard to even look at him, I was so scared. Everything was different now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yay,” I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yay,” Rhys repeated back in the same quiet tone. “Is there anything you want us to look out for, Sawyer?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Fever, unusual behavior, anything really in that realm, and we’ll do a check-up in a couple of days. But even though I’m saying you can go home Grace, I really want you to continue to rest, okay?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I promise I’ll rest, but can I get some clothes to wear out of here? I really don’t want to walk out of here in a hospital gown, but I will if I have to.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Your clothes were covered in blood,” Rhys said slowly, “But I had Arlo grab you some that will probably fit.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why were they covered in blood?” I asked as I accepted the new ones and Sawyer left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Your nose, eyes, and mouth were all bleeding.” Rhys answered uneasily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“From a poison? Ew gross.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It was a little gross,” Rhys confirmed, “You’re always beautiful, but that wasn’t your best look.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed as I untucked the part of the dress that got stuck and put my shoes on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he noticed I was ready, Rhys swept me off my feet, taking me by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rhys, what are you doing?” I asked in surprise as he carried me out of the room to where Ethan and Arlo were waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Taking you home.” He answered easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can walk.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Seriously, Rhys, please put me down, I want to walk.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Arlo and Ethan stood awkwardly as fought, but I didn’t care. I did not need to be babied. I was fine now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But I can keep you safe in my arms.” Rhys pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And now you can keep me safe by your side, put me down please.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys sighed, but this time he did what I asked. Ethan immediately moved to my side, and I knew they were both worried we would encounter danger again. I mean, the last time it happened right in front of them, and they didn’t catch it, so now they were borderline paranoid, but I appreciated of their effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only did I have Rhys’ physical comfort from his arm draped over my shoulder, I also had him in my head. I could tell he was sending calming words and vibes even if I couldn’t hear them exactly. But his intention was clear, what happened with his ex-bride, was never going to happen again if he could help it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No one is ever going to hurt you like that again,” Rhys whispered into my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan must have heard it though because he then muttered, “Yea, you’ll feed them to the wolves if they do.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took everything in me not to freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I asked hesitantly, my heart beginning to pound a little bit. He couldn&#39;t possibly mean literally, could he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you didn&#39;t know?&#34; Ethan looked at me dumbly. &#34;He literally fed Allison to the wolves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to vomit. No. He couldn&#39;t be that cruel, could he? I turned toward Rhys, looking for an answer, but he looked unbothered by the questions of what happened to Allison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t feed her to the wolves,&#34; Rhys answered calmly, &#34;But I did let them chase her down and not intervene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They ate her?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More or less,&#34; He shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated how casual he was being... How could he admit to it as if he didn&#39;t allow something horrible happen to that girl? That girl was crazy, but did she really deserve that? Is that how he had killed all of his other brides before me? Was I next?!</p>
