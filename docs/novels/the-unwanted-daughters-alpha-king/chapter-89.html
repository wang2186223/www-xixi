                <p>Everything faded when Rhys sent me over the edge. The was no more pain. No more feelings, just absolute pure bliss. I had had very few moments in my life that had made me feel this way, but Rhys was giving me more and more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How are you feeling, babe?” Rhys asked, his hand running up and down my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t think the word perfect even begins to describe how I feel,” I told him honestly. “I felt kind of weird when I woke up, and then I don’t know. I think I’ve gone through every emotion in the book today, but right now I feel perfect. Like I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m glad you feel that way.” Rhys answered with a kiss. “Because I also feel like I am exactly where I need to be.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at him as he brushed some my escaped strands of hair from my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I told Alana to stock the fridge on our floor with all your favorite snacks.” Rhys said, “She told me that it’s all there, and she stocked your favorite drinks as well. I also had her deliver us a blanket warmer, so if you are looking to be more cozy you can be.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. All that sounded nice, but I didn’t like the one part he wasn’t saying...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you going somewhere?” I asked after a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Unfortunately, yes,” He answered with a sad look. “We planned the pack hunt for tonight to celebrate our mateship. I don’t want it to look like anything is wrong, so I have to go.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But Rhys, you never stay.... Plus, don’t you think it will look weird that I don’t attend?” I asked. “I mean since the ceremony is supposed to be about the two of us?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Maybe a little, but they know you’re bound, so you wouldn’t have necessarily been able to participate in the pack hunt, so I’m not sure what to expect if I’m being honest. You would only have been able to participate in the party aspect of it.” He explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can go.” I told him. I wanted to go. This was supposed to be for us both...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You heard Sawyer,” Rhys argued as he got up. “You are supposed to be resting.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t think Sawyer would have approved of sex then,” I pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, he probably wouldn’t have for a variety of reasons,” Rhys agreed much to my disdain. “But we did it, and now you’re tired, and I have to go.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pecked my lips as I pouted, and I wanted to deepen it, but he pulled away too quickly, leaving me wanting more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I have guards arranged to protect you and if you need anything at all, just call for one of them, but keep the door locked otherwise. I will see you later,” Rhys smiled, and then he shut the door, and he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes. Rhys was right. I was exhausted. Everything inside me was exhausted, and I found myself drifting off into an uneasy sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around midnight though I woke up from the weirdest dream. It was already fading from my memory, but it had been so vivid. So real. So terrifying. I reached for Rhys, but he was still gone. I was getting really sick of waking up in an empty bed every time I fell asleep. I also was beginning to think that Rhys just never slept. He ran on only a few hours if any for as long as I’ve known him. It couldn’t possibly be healthy, but yet I’m the one who gets lectured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind shifted again to being poisoned, my own unease about being alone right now growing. I thought about going to wake Sawyer or Alana, but then I realized they were probably at the pack run celebration. I also thought about going to find a guard and having them tell Rhys to come home, but I didn’t...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned on the light by my bed as I tossed and turned in the bed. For whatever reason, I could not get my heartbeat to calm down. I got up and began to pace the room. Was this a part of what getting your period felt like? Increased anxiety and weird dreams? Because if this was it, I wanted absolutely no part in it every month for nearly the rest of my fucking life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped at the sound. Who in their right mind would be knocking at this hour? Sawyer should have been the only one able to get up here... Or maybe it was Alana, just checking on me since Rhys had told her I was unwell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved hesitantly toward the door as the person began to knock again with a little more urgency. I opened the door door slowly, surprised to Ethan standing there looking disheveled and tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ethan? What are you doing here?’ I questioned in surprise, inviting him into my room despite the late hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You are in danger, Grace. Intruders have taken advantage of Rhys and a most of the guards being away on the hunt. They’ve kill almost all of the guards. They’re here for you; we have to move you to safety.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded as fear flooded my system. I grabbed my nearest hoodie and threw it on before following Ethan into the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Where are we going?” I whispered as we began to creep into the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Somewhere safe,” Ethan answered calmly. “I’m going to shift, it will help mask your scent, giving you an extra layer of protection, and if we run into anyone, I can fight them.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It kinda made sense, but I was so filled with fear, I wasn’t in a place where I could question anything. Were they here for me? And if they were hear for me, were they here to kill me, or take me back to Adrian and Kinsley, or was there a 3rd unknown threat? My thoughts were racing as I followed Ethan without a second thought as we made our way up to the rooftop. I had never been up there before, but after seeing the hallway and stairs littered with dead bodies, I would go anywhere Ethan told me was safe. And lucky for us, we didn’t see any signs of the enemy other than the dead bodies I could not identify as human, wolf or Lycan. Had they died trying to protect me? Or were they the enemies&#39; bodies? Ethan didn&#39;t say a word as we moved past them. His calm was almost erie. He didn&#39;t look scared at all. Just determined, as I was shaking like a leaf, struggling to now grip the ladder leading up to the roof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Grace, we don&#39;t have all day,&#34; He encouraged, but even then his words seemed to lack urgency. He just stood at the bottom of the ladder, almost looking bored, but I knew he must just be trying to play it cool for my sake. I mean, there was no other reason to be so non-chalant, right? It made sense... Everything made sense. It was all crumbling down in the exact way I expected it to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart pounded as I climbed. My body trembled whether from fear or the chill of the air, I wasn&#39;t sure. But I wished with my whole heart that Rhys was here. However, I knew whatever was chasing us, I would have to face alone with my brother. I could do this. I had no choice. I had to do this.</p>
