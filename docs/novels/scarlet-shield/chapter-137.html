                <p>A long time ago, there was a sensational news story about a young woman who had just graduated from college and was kidnapped by human traffickers to a small village, similar to Willowbrook Village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was forced to become a baby-making machine, suffering even more than the three victims we know about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents weren&#39;t around, and the man she was forced to marry was chosen at random.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To break her spirit and prevent her from escaping, they beat her constantly until she got pregnant, and then the beatings stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t give up on her life. She chose to face her situation with strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using her power as a woman, as a mother, she became a respected figure in that village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She led the entire village to prosperity and eventually found her biological parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents thought she would leave, but she chose to stay in the village where she was taken. She said that only by staying and changing their mindset could she help reduce the number of women and children being trafficked in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her actions truly showcased the power of women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as a person didn&#39;t bow to fate, they could overcome it, living the life they wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla had no right to decide others&#39; life and death, yet she handed them the knife to stab themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Robert handcuffed Rilla, she was still worried about Hugh. &#34;You&#39;ll investigate Hugh&#39;s factory, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We promised you, and we&#39;ll get it done. Not just for you, but for all citizens. We must eliminate all threats to public health. That&#39;s our duty as Veridian cops!&#34; Robert&#39;s solemn response reassured Rilla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Rilla&#39;s case wrapped up, Zoey stretched as she walked out of the interrogation room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was sitting outside, fiddling with a piggy bank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her, he shook the piggy bank in the air: &#34;All done. Does it look like new?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was a bit speechless. Was she praising him like a child?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She always liked to act like the leader in front of him, and Alexander was used to it. He didn&#39;t argue with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and asked, &#34;How&#39;s Rilla&#39;s situation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She confessed, but it led to other issues, which might be more troublesome than the case itself.&#34; Zoey gave Alexander a look, and they walked out of the church together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They talked about the case as they walked, yawning in the cold night air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they knew it, they were at Faye&#39;s doorstep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey handed the piggy bank to Alexander. &#34;You go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate crybabies, especially boys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was speechless, but he could understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the piggy bank and walked inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he stepped in, Zoey called him back. &#34;Take this too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She handed him the torn page from the diary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the case solved, the evidence was no longer needed. Cinda could place it on their graves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander took it all inside as Zoey instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was back out in less than a minute. &#34;The case is closed. We can head back to Emerald City.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey frowned deeply and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her stomach growled. She was hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;I think there&#39;s a cup of noodles in Dennis&#39;s car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect, go get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night deepened, a car with out-of-state plates slowly drove out of Willowbrook Village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The case of the three female corpses was solved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ugliness of Willowbrook Village was finally exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert stayed behind for a week to handle Hugh&#39;s factory before returning to Emerald City.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Hugh was punished, the local media quickly reported it, and it became the hottest news for several days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Netizens, as Zoey predicted, condemned Willowbrook Village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They couldn&#39;t believe such a backward place still existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But since the police released the report, it confirmed the case&#39;s authenticity. Various online influencers shared their thoughts, highlighting the horrors of Willowbrook Village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some influencers even planned to rent houses in Willowbrook Village to livestream and show it from a first-person perspective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The explosive public outcry drew the attention and intervention of relevant authorities, promising a different future for the village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey watched the news about Willowbrook Village and thought about her conversation with Rilla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only guessed, but it all came true. Did this consider that she hadn&#39;t lied to Rilla?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert hadn&#39;t even reached home yet, and insisted on enrolling Zoey in a driving school, with Robert footing the bill and asking Tenley to say it was reimbursed by his work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was smart and quickly passed the written test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spent weekends completing the vision test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day Robert returned, Zoey had just gotten home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ran into each other, and Zoey greeted him first, &#34;Officer Davis, you&#39;re back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Zoey, Robert&#39;s tired face brightened. &#34;How&#39;s the police station? Are you settling in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been quiet, just handling some small cases.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good. How&#39;s the driving going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pretty well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, try to get your license soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Officer Davis, I&#39;ll work hard.&#34; Zoey followed Robert into the house and headed straight to the bathroom for a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert had arranged for an old friend to be her instructor, hoping he could accommodate Zoey&#39;s schedule despite his busy work at the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, back from Willowbrook Village, he called to thank his friend. &#34;Kai, thanks for helping Zoey. Let&#39;s grab a meal sometime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert added, &#34;Zoey&#39;s great, right? Really smart. We didn&#39;t need more people, but she has a real talent for being a detective.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai laughed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we talk? Why do you keep laughing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai couldn&#39;t take it anymore and snapped at Robert, his voice booming. &#34;Thanks a lot, Robert! Where did you find this student? She&#39;s incredible! I&#39;ve never seen someone who couldn&#39;t drive three feet in half a day, but she wants to hit the road after one lesson! Ridiculous! Who drives 60 mph on their first lesson? I was scared to the extreme!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not just me, the other students in the car were terrified! They wouldn&#39;t get back in! How does she dare? How? I was so scared. I didn&#39;t dare scold her, afraid she&#39;d take me straight to heaven!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was speechless.</p>
