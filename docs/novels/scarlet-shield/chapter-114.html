                <p>It took Finn a few seconds to realize that strangers had suddenly entered his home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his head, but since he was crouching, he had to look up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three adults were staring at him, their expressions somewhat stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn felt a bit intimidated by their imposing presence. After all, he was just a kid. He swallowed hard, stumbled to his feet, and tried to find his mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after taking a couple of steps, he remembered that his mom wasn&#39;t home. She had told him where she was going just a moment ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander noticed Finn&#39;s fear and gave him a reassuring smile. &#34;Hey, you&#39;re Finn, right? Is your mom around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she&#39;s not...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any idea when she&#39;ll be back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander kept his smile gentle, trying not to scare him. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, kiddo. We&#39;re not here to hurt you. We were here last time too. Remember us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Alexander&#39;s comforting words, Finn slowly nodded. &#34;Yeah, you guys are like cops. Our teacher told us that cops are good people. They catch bad guys and never bully good people. We respect them a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander chuckled at Finn&#39;s innocence. &#34;That&#39;s right, you&#39;re a smart kid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, since your teacher told you we&#39;re good people, can I ask you some questions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn realized his teacher was right. Seeing Alexander&#39;s smile, he felt less scared. &#34;Sure, if I know the answers, I&#39;ll tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have two sisters?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn nodded, but his tone and expression showed no sadness. &#34;Yeah, I have two sisters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander observed his demeanor, guessing that the family had hidden the truth about the sisters&#39; deaths from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked again, &#34;Are your sisters home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Finn shook his head. &#34;My mom said they went far away to work. They&#39;re going to make money to buy me a house and find me a wife. They&#39;ll make lots of money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the conversation was on track, Jordan joined in. &#34;How do your sisters treat you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re really nice to me. They take me out to play and tell me stories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do your sisters like to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn thought for a moment. &#34;They like to write in their diaries, save money, cook, and go out to listen to stories...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey noticed something and interrupted. &#34;Where do they go to listen to stories?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the group entered the house, Finn was most afraid of Zoey, maybe because her voice was a bit loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear quickly spread across Finn&#39;s face. &#34;I-I don&#39;t know. My sisters don&#39;t take me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey pressed on. &#34;Why don&#39;t they take you? Do they not like you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, my sisters like me...&#34; But after answering, Finn suddenly realized that his sisters hadn&#39;t talked to him or called home in a long time. He started to feel as though. &#34;Maybe my sisters don&#39;t like me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t cry, it&#39;s not like that. You&#39;re their only brother. They like you the most.&#34; Alexander comforted him. &#34;Think carefully. What reason did your sisters give for not taking you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn nodded. &#34;Right, my sisters said only girls could go listen to stories. So I wanted to be a girl too...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan understood. &#34;The sisters probably just wanted to go out by themselves and didn&#39;t want to take Finn. Girls have their own secrets to share.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t respond to Jordan. He continued, &#34;Do you know if your sisters wrote in their diaries every day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, they wrote in their diaries every day. Both of them did. I wanted to read them, but they wouldn&#39;t let me. They said it was their privacy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know what their diaries look like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn nodded eagerly. &#34;I know! I have a lot of them. Come with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group followed Finn into the house, straight to his and his mom&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one bed and a desk. Most of the books on the desk were first to fourth-grade textbooks and some comic books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn crouched in front of the desk and skillfully pulled out the last notebook from a stack of identical ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed it to them. &#34;This is the notebook I&#39;ve been saving since first grade. My sisters&#39; notebooks are all here too. They told me notebooks are important. I can draw and write in them...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander opened one at random. It was a new, blank notebook with no writing in it. &#34;Did your sisters use this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn thought for a moment, then opened the desk drawer and took out a pink notebook with a Snow White sticker on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With only the group in the house, he made a &#39;shh&#39; gesture. &#34;Sir, I hope you won&#39;t tell my sisters about this. I want to surprise them. I saved up my own money to buy this. Many girls at school use this notebook, but it&#39;s too expensive. My sisters wouldn&#39;t buy it for themselves, so I saved my mom&#39;s spare change to buy it for them. I haven&#39;t had lunch for a week. Please don&#39;t tell them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the pure and kind-hearted Finn, the group&#39;s mood grew heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A child&#39;s world was always simple. His mom didn&#39;t want to tell him the truth, probably for this reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he knew his two sisters were dead, how devastated would he be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was better to let time gradually fade this secret until he could handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, we&#39;ll keep your secret. Remember, we&#39;re cops.&#34; Alexander ruffled his hair, feeling a pang of sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he looked at Finn, the more he liked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the way, do you know where your sisters&#39; diaries are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, they&#39;re on my sisters&#39; desk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you help us find them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; Finn, being a helpful child, agreed immediately and walked to his sisters&#39; room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the drawer but didn&#39;t see the diaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finn searched the drawer thoroughly, puzzled. &#34;They were here. Where did they go...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group watched Finn&#39;s every move, knowing he didn&#39;t seem to be pretending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed the diaries had indeed been taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant their previous theory was correct. The diaries must contain some secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If the diaries had something harmful, they might have been destroyed by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By whom? The killer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The killer might not know about the diaries. I think it could be the sisters themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander disagreed with Zoey&#39;s guess. &#34;I don&#39;t think so. I also like to write in a diary. Diaries hold too many memories that the brain can&#39;t always recall. Writing in a diary becomes a habit. Not writing for a day feels uncomfortable. Many people even want their diaries buried with them when they die.&#34;</p>
