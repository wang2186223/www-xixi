                <p>He chuckled weakly, &#34;Haha, my student&#39;s got some serious skills, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai, still catching his breath, replied, &#34;Yeah! She&#39;s only been at it for a bit and she&#39;s already this good. Too bad she doesn&#39;t fly fighter jets!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert chimed in, &#34;Fighter jets? No way! Our detective squad needs talent like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear how much Zoey had shocked Kai.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a bit awkward, Robert remembered Zoey&#39;s various antics at the police station and felt somewhat apologetic. &#34;Kai, once she gets her driver&#39;s license, I&#39;ll treat you to three meals. How about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kai angrily hung up without giving him a single reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Robert hung up, Tenley noticed his goofy smile. &#34;What happened? Why are you so happy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert said, &#34;Zoey and Kelvin are like two extremes. I still remember when Kelvin went to get his driver&#39;s license, Kai was just as angry, saying the kid was too cautious, taking forever to press the gas pedal and spending tens of seconds checking the road conditions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talking about Kelvin, they both suddenly remembered they had a son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley added, &#34;By the way, Kelvin said he&#39;s free these days and might come back next week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Let me know when he&#39;s coming back. I&#39;ll take a few days off to spend time with him, see if he&#39;s been keeping fit while living away.&#34; Robert&#39;s face couldn&#39;t hide his pride when he mentioned Kelvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley smiled, &#34;You don&#39;t scare him away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scare him? I&#39;m just concerned about him. You know, as a doctor, he spends most of his time sitting. If I don&#39;t teach him well, he might catch something from the hospital. How can he treat others if he doesn&#39;t stay healthy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert had been so exhausted from handling Hugh&#39;s case that he fell asleep as soon as he lay down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They completely forgot that Kelvin&#39;s room had been rented out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no place for Kelvin in the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A week later, Kelvin returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the earliest train, thinking that when he got home, Tenley would have a big meal waiting for him, just like old times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He imagined enjoying a happy time with his parents, then taking a lazy nap, and later chatting and watching TV with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a beautiful thought, but when he opened the door, there wasn&#39;t a person in sight, let alone a big meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, Mom, I&#39;m home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no one answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin thought they might be out grocery shopping, so he changed into his slippers and headed straight to his room to find his pajamas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t like wearing formal clothes at home; pajamas were the most comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he opened the bedroom door, neatly placed at the entrance was a pink pajama set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his head, he saw a girl lying on his bed who was reading a book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I must have entered the wrong room.&#34; Kelvin lowered his head and quickly backed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing the unfamiliar Zoey, he completely forgot this was his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until he stepped out that he realized that was his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was there a woman living in his room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, seeing Kelvin&#39;s flustered departure, thought he was foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert and Tenley hadn&#39;t mentioned Kelvin&#39;s return. Maybe he wanted to surprise his parents?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey got up from the bed and called out his name, &#34;Kelvin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin instinctively responded, his handsome face full of confusion, &#34;You... know me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Zoey Brown, your dad&#39;s subordinate. I&#39;m staying here for a while.&#34; With Zoey&#39;s explanation, Kelvin understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still confirmed, &#34;You&#39;re staying in my room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, five hundred bucks a month, including three meals and rides to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin was speechless. In the pricey Emerald City, his parents had rented out his room for such a low price. Did they think so little of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kelvin could say anything, Zoey took on a host-like demeanor, &#34;I&#39;ve already paid several months&#39; rent, so I have the right to use this room. Understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; No wonder he was Robert&#39;s son, so easy to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t need to explain further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey yawned and stretched, planning to close the door and continue her nap. She needed to recharge during her rare time off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was about to close the door, Kelvin called out, &#34;Do you know where my parents went?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They went to run a marathon. They should be back in the afternoon.&#34; Zoey replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, thanks.&#34; Kelvin placed his suitcase next to the sofa. Even though it was his home, with Zoey there, his actions felt restricted and a bit awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His peripheral vision kept catching glimpses of Zoey because the space was so small, it was hard not to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strangely, seeing Zoey made him inexplicably nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey noticed his fatigue and, trying to appear more approachable, asked, &#34;Have you had breakfast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go eat. There&#39;s food in the kitchen. Just heat it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin felt speechless. It seemed like this had become her home, and he was the guest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks.&#34; Kelvin felt a bit conflicted but accepted the reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had the right to use his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked, &#34;Ms. Brown, do you know where my pajamas are? I&#39;d like to take a shower. I got all sweaty from the trip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Check your wardrobe. I haven&#39;t touched it. I don&#39;t have many clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Kelvin stood up and headed to the room to check the wardrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he reached the door, he remembered what Zoey had said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He no longer had the right to the room. If he just walked in, would Zoey think he had no manners?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though it was his room, he had to meekly look at Zoey, &#34;Could you help me get them? Sorry for the trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem.&#34; She went in and rummaged through the wardrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pajamas were right on top, in plain sight. She found them and handed them to him, &#34;Is this it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, that&#39;s it.&#34; Kelvin thanked her and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Zoey called out again, &#34;I think you might need this too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin saw it was his underwear in her hand, feeling extremely embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really didn&#39;t see him as a man at all.</p>
