                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t understand such thoughts and mindset at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it hadn&#39;t come from the short-haired woman, he wouldn&#39;t have believed that a biological mother would do such a thing to her own daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see. So if Janet and the village chief&#39;s son like each other, Janet can leave home, which would be a good thing for her.&#34; Alexander said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A good thing? Hahaha.&#34; The woman in the black sweater was laughing at Alexander. &#34;Have you seen the village chief&#39;s son? Which girl in the village likes him? Who could like him? He&#39;s not even as tall as I am, and his looks, don&#39;t even mention it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to want to complain more, but the short-haired woman beside her nudged her. She also shook her head at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the two exchanged glances, they stopped talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander keenly sensed that they seemed to be hiding something, indicating that they couldn&#39;t say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey also heard some of it and walked closer, asking seriously, &#34;So, you&#39;re saying Janet doesn&#39;t like the village chief&#39;s son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The short-haired woman and the woman in the black sweater immediately looked at her, their eyes filled with growing terror. &#34;Shh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if Zoey&#39;s words had touched some taboo of theirs, seeming very strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey frowned, not knowing what they were up to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The short-haired woman continued, &#34;How should I put it, these things are behaviors and results between two people, and both are voluntary. Although the village chief&#39;s son is not good-looking, he is rich. Who in the countryside doesn&#39;t want their daughter to marry a rich man? Janet is just too foolish.. If she hadn&#39;t made such a fuss on the night Renee arranged her engagement, Renee wouldn&#39;t have disliked her so much. She cried as if she were dying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t she dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman in the black sweater added, &#34;I think the most pitiful ones are the two daughters of the Lynn Family. They raised them for so long, and suddenly they were gone. If it weren&#39;t for her son still being left, Cinda might have lost the will to live long ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hasn&#39;t her family lost children before? Didn&#39;t she live well? Maybe she&#39;s used to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was slightly stunned and quickly asked, &#34;The Lynn Family lost children before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was a long time ago,&#34; said the woman in the black sweater. &#34;After Cinda had these two daughters, she had another one, still a girl. She wanted to keep her, but her husband was adamantly against it. They put the child in the river, leaving her fate to destiny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey clenched her fists, &#34;Isn&#39;t that murder!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not murder,&#34; said the woman in the black sweater. &#34;When they abandoned the child, I was watching by the river. The child was still breathing, floating down the river. Maybe someone along the river picked her up. Besides, even if they didn&#39;t abandon her, their family was too poor to raise so many children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s molars were almost grinding to pieces, &#34;If they can&#39;t afford to raise them, why have them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it because they didn&#39;t have a boy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, in our village, every family has a boy. If you don&#39;t have a son when you&#39;re old, you&#39;ll be laughed at. And if you don&#39;t have a son, you don&#39;t have an heir. Without an heir, it&#39;s disrespectful to the ancestors, and you&#39;ll be punished!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the women even started explaining to Zoey, &#34;Although our village is backward, we&#39;re not stupid. A woman must have a son, or you&#39;ll be criticized for a lifetime. See that?&#34; She pointed to a house in the village with smoke coming out of the chimney, &#34;That family, the wife couldn&#39;t have a son, so she let her husband find another wife. The first time, she had a boy, and now the whole family is doing well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, I found that having a son requires talent. Some people can&#39;t have a boy after seven or eight tries, while others have a boy on the first try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The women started ignoring Zoey and Alexander, launching into another topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talking about how to have a son, they became more enthusiastic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey listened for a while, her mood shifting from anger to indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the time on her phone. They had been talking about this topic for over twenty minutes. She bluntly interjected, &#34;Have any of you ever been to school?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The women looked at each other, not knowing if her question had anything to do with the case, and nodded in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey also nodded, &#34;Oh, no wonder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quieter woman instantly sensed something off in Zoey&#39;s tone and asked, &#34;What do you mean? Speak clearly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder you...&#34; Zoey hadn&#39;t finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander quickly interjected with a smile, &#34;I heard someone in the village pursued Faye. Do you know who it was?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed they were hearing this for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They quickly shifted their attention from Zoey to Alexander, &#34;What&#39;s the situation? Who pursued Faye? Who told you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Cinda tell you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she say someone was pursuing Faye? What did the guy look like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that they genuinely didn&#39;t know, Alexander didn&#39;t want to stay with them any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was also afraid he couldn&#39;t hold back, so he maintained his composure, politely said goodbye, and turned to leave with Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked quite a distance before Alexander realized he was still holding Zoey&#39;s delicate wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling something was off, he cautiously observed Zoey&#39;s face, and he saw her eyes full of murderous intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander quickly let go, &#34;Don&#39;t be mad, I just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish explaining, Zoey replied, &#34;I don&#39;t get mad at fools.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;Don&#39;t call names.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t call you names.&#34; she said angrily, &#34;I&#39;ll show you what name-calling looks like someday!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was silent, thinking there was no need for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They returned to the church, and it was completely dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willowbrook Village had no streetlights, only the lights from nearby houses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander turned on the flashlight on his phone to lead the way for Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willowbrook Village was on a hillside, and at night it was not only cold but also filled with more insect sounds than in the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s already the 21st century, and our country still has such backward places.&#34; Alexander thought about the people they had questioned in the supermarket and what they had said, feeling inexplicably depressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;Why is it called Willowbrook Village? It&#39;s a waste of the name. It should be called Primitive Tribe!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Alexander wholeheartedly agreed with Zoey, &#34;You&#39;re right. I used to misunderstand you, but it seems I was the one with limited knowledge.&#34;</p>
