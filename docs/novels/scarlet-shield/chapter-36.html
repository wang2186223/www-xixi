                <p>Alexander noticed Brian&#39;s agreement with his words, and the smile on his face deepened slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;It seems like your relationship has been quite strong lately, even to the point of life and death. He can make you willingly help him dispose of a body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian was stunned. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian looked bewildered. &#34;He killed someone? No, what does his killing someone have to do with me? With his reclusive personality, it&#39;s a character flaw that he could commit murder, but not me! I&#39;m a normal person; don&#39;t accuse me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After responding to Alexander, he muttered under his breath, &#34;Oh my God, I&#39;ve been with a murderer for so long, so terrifying. Damn, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander ignored his poor acting and continued to ask, &#34;How can it have nothing to do with you? Don&#39;t you spend every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday together? How could you not have noticed anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian realized that Alexander&#39;s questions were pressing him step by step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pretended to think for a moment, then he said, &#34;I really didn&#39;t notice anything... Every time, he would clean the house spotless over the weekend. He told me he had OCD and couldn&#39;t stand any dirt. He also had a bit of a compulsive disorder. If there was anything strange...&#34; He thought for a moment and then answered Alexander, &#34;It would be his guest bedroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, &#34;Whenever we stayed up late playing games, he wouldn&#39;t allow me to sleep in the guest bedroom, insisting that I sleep on the couch instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guest bedroom.&#34; Alexander remembered what Zoey had said and looked sharply at Brian, continuing to ask, &#34;Didn&#39;t you ever look in the guest bedroom out of curiosity, or did you hear any sounds coming from it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian replied, &#34;Officer, since you&#39;ve investigated this far, you should know that those old houses have poor soundproofing, right? There were no sounds from the guest bedroom, but I often heard the neighbors next door making noise in bed, which was really annoying. It disturbed me so much I wanted to yell at them. They don&#39;t care about anyone else&#39;s feelings at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander could tell that his last two sentences were genuine, as his expression was too real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recorded everything Brian said and continued to ask, &#34;Tell me, what do you and Lawrence do when you spend several days together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian said, &#34;What else can we do? We usually indulge in games, eat when hunger strikes, and sleep when fatigue sets in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander asked a few irrelevant questions to make Brian relax a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He responded and immediately brought the topic back to the fake license plate car, &#34;You said you&#39;ve been using this car, so explain why the victim&#39;s blood was found in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blood?&#34; Brian shook his head frantically. &#34;I don&#39;t know about that. I always drive the car alone, and there&#39;s no one else in it. Aren&#39;t there surveillance cameras along the way? Can&#39;t you check them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his eyes kept darting between the two officers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian noticed that Alexander&#39;s gaze was fixed on him and continued, &#34;Maybe Lawrence deliberately put it in the car to frame me. With his reclusive personality, it&#39;s not hard to understand why he would do something like that, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Brian cursed, &#34;Damn it, no wonder he kept asking me to go to his house, so he wanted me to take the fall for him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sneered, &#34;Alright, don&#39;t be so quick to say that. Our police won&#39;t wrongfully accuse anyone, but we also won&#39;t let any guilty person go. You say you don&#39;t know anything, but you should know this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out a photo and handed it to Brian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian looked at the black plastic bag in the photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander asked, &#34;Does this black plastic bag look familiar? Explain why your fingerprints were found on it, and not just one. Do you need me to remind you what was inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was the victim&#39;s dismembered body parts.&#34; Alexander saw Brian shudder uncontrollably and continued, &#34;There was also the victim&#39;s head. Do you need me to describe it in detail?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impossible!&#34; Brian almost blurted out. &#34;Are you trying to trick me, so you lead me in this direction on purpose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you suddenly so agitated?&#34; Alexander looked at him in confusion. &#34;You said you spent so much time with Lawrence, so helping him take out the trash is a normal thing, right? Why use the word &#39;impossible&#39; to answer me? It&#39;s strange; could it be that you were also involved in the murder and dismemberment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not!&#34; Brian visibly tensed up. He seemed to be thinking, but only he knew what he was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds of hesitation, Brian seemed to have calmed down, and he answered,&#34;I think I remember helping him take out a trash bag once. Maybe that&#39;s when my fingerprints got on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander heard Brian admit it and deliberately glanced at the files on the table. &#34;I was mistaken; sorry, the trash bag didn&#39;t have your fingerprints.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you messing with me?&#34; Brian suddenly stood up, his eyes bloodshot, staring at Alexander as if he was about to kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander looked at the anxious Brian and smiled even more deeply, but quickly returned to his previous expression. &#34;Mr. Scott, don&#39;t be in such a hurry. Why are you so anxious? After all, you didn&#39;t kill anyone, right? I just said that our police won&#39;t let any bad person go, nor will we wrongfully accuse any good person. And I didn&#39;t say the corpse was in the trash bag. You were just helping Lawrence take out his household trash, so why are you so anxious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian shouted, &#34;No, you just said it!&#34; He remembered that Alexander had clearly mentioned the murder and dismemberment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He anxiously looked at Dennis next to Alexander, as if seeking confirmation. &#34;Sir, you can&#39;t play tricks on an innocent person. He clearly said it just now, how can he deny it now? Isn&#39;t this wrongfully accusing me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cooperate properly; don&#39;t shout!&#34; Dennis pounded the table forcefully. &#34;Whether you&#39;re wrongfully accused or not, you have the right to request the interrogation footage. What are you afraid of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian thought that seeking confirmation from Dennis just now was really stupid!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis and Alexander were both police officers; of course, Dennis would side with his colleague.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this, Brian suppressed his anger and said, &#34;Whether you mentioned it or not, I&#39;m just an ordinary citizen. If you really had evidence, you wouldn&#39;t be wasting your time here and making up lies. I&#39;m telling you, I didn&#39;t kill anyone! As for the trash bag, if you visit someone&#39;s house and they ask you to take out the trash, isn&#39;t that normal? Want to arrest me? Come on, if you can show the real evidence.&#34;&#34;</p>
