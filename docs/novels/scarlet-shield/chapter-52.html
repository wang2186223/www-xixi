                <p>Derek&#39;s snot was yellow and thick, and he kept sniffling while talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was about to throw up and wanted to leave quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek was also infuriated by Zoey&#39;s words. Unable to outargue her, Zoey raised her chubby hand!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey watched all this with a cold smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, children were just like their parents. It was like how inferior genes were always more easily passed down than superior ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her parents hit her, she didn&#39;t fight back. First, because of the gratitude for raising her, and second, because she still needed money and had to return to that home. She had to endure even if she didn&#39;t want to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as for Derek in front of her, Zoey definitely wouldn&#39;t show him any kindness!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey swiftly turned to dodge his slap, then quickly used the wall for leverage, stepped on it, and kicked Derek hard in the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a howl of pain, Derek stumbled and fell to the ground due to his clumsiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in so much pain that tears almost came out, but he still stubbornly said, &#34;Pat, I&#39;m going to kill you today, you lunatic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sharing the same last name with you is really embarrassing.&#34; Zoey had actually intended to leave, but upon hearing Derek&#39;s continued bluster, she decided to stay a while longer. She crouched down and stared intently at Derek&#39;s current disheveled state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her foot stepped directly on his chubby hand but didn&#39;t press down. &#34;Derek, if you have the guts, kill me now. Otherwise, as long as I&#39;m alive, you won&#39;t have a good time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek cursed, &#34;Fuck, you lunatic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t care about Derek cursing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Derek a disdainful look, then stood up. Suddenly, she thought of something, squatted down again, and took a phone out of Derek&#39;s pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he attempted to snatch it, Zoey&#39;s foot, which had landed in his grasp, suddenly exerted force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It hurts.&#34; Derek endured the pain and still shouted, &#34;Don&#39;t touch my stuff! My grandma just gave that to me! Give it back! If my grandma finds out, she won&#39;t let you off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Won&#39;t let me off?&#34; Zoey wondered how his parents and Fiona could possibly not let her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she changed her name, didn&#39;t she just get slapped twice? Taking the phone would just mean a few more slaps. She didn&#39;t care at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pat! Are you out of your mind!&#34; Seeing that he couldn&#39;t get the phone back, Derek started cursing, &#34;Fuck, you&#39;ll die a horrible death! You thief, you bitch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey really wanted to record this scene and play it back for Lena and Gordon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their precious son Derek had become this stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you forget that I changed my name? I&#39;m Zoey now, so you&#39;d better remember that with your stupid brain. Repeat it a few times. If you, as my brother, don&#39;t know my name, it would rediculous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes darkened, and she looked terrifying. &#34;I said it before, as long as I&#39;m alive, you won&#39;t have a good time!&#34; After saying that, Zoey got up and threw the phone out the window!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From this height, the phone was definitely done for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek kept staring at Zoey&#39;s hand. When she saw that it was indeed empty when she pulled it back, he was even more furious. &#34;Pat! I&#39;m going to kill you! You bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t even shown off the phone for a few days, and Zoey had destroyed it. Besides, it was the latest model. He had plans to play games with his classmates! Zoey had ruined everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek got up in a mess and charged at Zoey, determined to fight her to the death! But at that moment, a voice made him instantly sober up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek turned around and saw that it was the school principal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the principal approached, more students gathered to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek realized that his loud voice had attracted them. He was stunned, not knowing what to do in this sudden situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The principal walked over, recognized them as siblings, and first gave Derek a stern look, then looked at Zoey with a gentle expression. &#34;Pat, what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey seized the opportunity, her face looking very innocent and aggrieved. &#34;Principal, I found out that my brother Derek brought a phone to school. I know our school doesn&#39;t allow phones, so I wanted him to give it to the teachers for safekeeping until after school. But Derek didn&#39;t want to and insisted on playing, so I tried to take it from him, and the phone accidentally fell out the window. Derek got even angrier and wanted to hit me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Zoey twist the whole situation, Derek unwillingly retorted, &#34;You&#39;re lying! That&#39;s not what happened!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was petite with her aggrieved expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The principal knew Zoey was petite and sensed she was aggrieved. He naturally understood the situation and glared at Derek, saying sharply, &#34;You say Pat is lying, so tell me, is the phone downstairs yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek nodded. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The principal found the flaw and twisted Derek&#39;s ear hard. &#34;I&#39;ve said it more than once in every Monday assembly! Don&#39;t bring phones to school; students should be focused on learning. What, don&#39;t you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Principal, I wasn&#39;t playing; she deliberately took my phone and threw it downstairs. She did it on purpose! Principal, you have to help me.&#34; Derek was almost in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the principal didn&#39;t listen to his explanation. He poked Derek&#39;s forehead angrily. &#34;Everyone in the school can see how Pat behaves! Pat is always the top student in every exam! And you? Can you even get into college?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Derek was silent. He couldn&#39;t clear his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you, if someone had a sister as excellent as Pat, they&#39;d feel pretty proud. But you? You bring a phone to school, and when Pat tries to correct your attitude, you accuse her of throwing your phone? Derek! It&#39;s okay if your grades aren&#39;t good; not every kid is born excellent. But your character must be upright! Today, you&#39;ve really disappointed me. Go, call your parents and have them come over!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that, the principal turned to Zoey with a completely different attitude and said gently, &#34;Pat, there&#39;s still an hour before class. Go take a nap and rest your brain.&#34;</p>
