                <p>Olivia&#39;s face turned anxious when she heard this, and she shifted uncomfortably in her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear that any drowsiness she had was now gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert and Zoey exchanged a glance, understanding each other without words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They quietly observed her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it were someone with strong mental fortitude, someone who grew up in a big city, it might be hard to get them to reveal the truth with just a few words. They wouldn&#39;t believe Robert&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Olivia was different. She had never seen much of the world, barely even watched TV, and spent most of her time on household chores.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just an inexperienced country girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s eyes were filled with deep sorrow as she slowly began to speak, &#34;I... I&#39;ll tell you everything...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After thinking for a moment, she asked with a sob in her voice, &#34;Sir, will I be executed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert didn&#39;t understand why she would ask such a question. Haven had committed suicide. Why would she be executed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he remained calm on the surface, &#34;It depends on whether what you tell us is true and if it helps with our investigation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia nodded, understanding somewhat. She looked down for a second, then asked, &#34;I don&#39;t know where to start...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert felt a bit of pity for this naive country girl and gently prompted, &#34;Start with the phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Olivia seemed to be organizing her thoughts. She began timidly, &#34;I found this phone when I married Hugh. I had asked Hugh to buy me a phone before, but Ava and Hugh scolded me. They were afraid I would use the phone to flirt with people. No matter how much I explained that I wouldn&#39;t, they didn&#39;t believe me and said awful things. I just saw that many people in the village had one, but I had nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even Evan had one. Ava told me that when I got older and had a child for the family, they would buy me one. She said it so firmly that I didn&#39;t dare bring it up again. Every time I did, they would scold me terribly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted a phone, but they insult me like that. One day, I found this phone by accident and played with it when they weren&#39;t around. I didn&#39;t even know how to turn it on and spent a long time figuring it out. Later, I watched how Hugh used it and learned how to charge it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert listened intently for a while, realizing she was rambling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t take it anymore and knocked on the table to interrupt her, &#34;Get to the point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia nodded, &#34;I found a video on the phone while messing around with it. You must have seen it already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s face showed fear as she thought about Haven&#39;s video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At first, I was puzzled why I hadn&#39;t gotten pregnant after all these years. After watching the video, I realized it wasn&#39;t my fault. I tried to convince Hugh to go to the hospital with me for a check-up, but he refused and scolded me. He had already been through several wives who couldn&#39;t have children, yet he still blamed others. Initially, I thought Haven&#39;s words were unbelievable, but one day, I overheard Hugh&#39;s parents talking...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From the day I married in, they planned to treat me like they did Haven. Haven&#39;s suicide made them hesitate. Ava said Haven wanted to die, and no one could stop her, but they had to think about the next generation. Hugh&#39;s father said that when he returned from his trip, he would rape me.&#34; Olivia&#39;s hands clenched tightly as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled deeply, &#34;I was really scared of becoming the next Haven. While Hugh&#39;s father was away, I tried my best to please Hugh and Ava, hoping they wouldn&#39;t treat me like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One time, I overheard Ava talking to Hugh&#39;s father on the phone, asking about me. I realized they are still heartless and still planned to treat me like Haven.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s eyes filled with hatred, &#34;Maybe Hugh&#39;s first wife went through the same thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey raised an eyebrow, clearly tired of hearing her ramble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bluntly asked, &#34;What does this have to do with the murder?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t kill anyone.&#34; Olivia stood up, agitated, &#34;I really didn&#39;t kill anyone! I just wanted to frame Hugh as a rapist to get him sent to prison. If he was in prison, Hugh&#39;s father wouldn&#39;t treat me like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert quickly caught the inconsistency in her story and asked, &#34;How did you frame him? What preparations did you make? Tell us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia looked at the calm police officers in front of her, and her emotions gradually settled, &#34;I didn&#39;t kill anyone... I really didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you find the bodies already dead that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! They were already dead!&#34; Olivia looked up, tears in her eyes, &#34;I was so scared, but I didn&#39;t kill them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, seeing her so agitated, thought she didn&#39;t seem like she was lying, and continued, &#34;Tell us about finding the bodies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Olivia said, &#34;Evan often sneaks out to play, and Ava doesn&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t know at first either. But one day, when I was cleaning his room, I caught him sneaking out. When he saw me, he made a &#39;shh&#39; gesture, asking me not to alert Ava, or she wouldn&#39;t let him go catch aliens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I kept trying to stop Evan, but he insisted on going. I was afraid something would happen, so I tried to keep an eye on him. But as soon as I turned my back, he ran off. When he came back that night, he told me he found aliens! I asked him what aliens were, and he took me to the church. I thought it was just some ordinary thing, but I saw three people hanging from the church rafters. I was scared to the extreme!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I sat on the ground for a long time before I could react. I thought Evan had hung them up as a prank. I was afraid something would happen, so I told Evan to take them down immediately. I called their names, but there was no response. That&#39;s when I realized that they were dead, all of them were dead bodies in front of me.&#34;</p>
