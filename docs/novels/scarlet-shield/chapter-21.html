                <p>Alexander grinned, &#34;You&#39;ve been a huge help with our case. The police will definitely reward you. Thanks for being such a cooperative citizen. Can you double-check the info you gave us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Alexander&#39;s friendly face, the guy&#39;s anger cooled off a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Zoey&#39;s words had ticked him off, she had a point: if he lost it now, he&#39;d be in trouble for assaulting an officer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was exactly what Zoey wanted, to get him locked up by his own doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way! He grudgingly sat back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shot Zoey a look, and she knew he was trying to back her up. She gave him a quick glance and left the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey headed down to the first floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There weren&#39;t as many customers now, so the few employees stocking shelves weren&#39;t as busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey spotted a girl in a work uniform and walked over, flashing her badge. &#34;Hey, can I ask you a few questions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl had her hair tied up and looked pretty efficient. &#34;Sure, what do you need to know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey nodded. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking this wasn&#39;t the best place to chat, Zoey asked the girl to go somewhere else with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The employee led her to the changing room on the first floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s talk here,&#34; the employee said. &#34;No one usually comes here until it&#39;s time to clock out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey glanced around the changing room and nodded. &#34;Okay, let&#39;s start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long have you been working here? What&#39;s your take on Lawrence? Noticed anything odd about him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl thought for a moment. &#34;He&#39;s super tidy and never says anything that makes us uncomfortable. Plus, he can cook, which is pretty rare for single guys. I think he&#39;s awesome!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though her info was different from the guy&#39;s, it was clear she liked clean, cooking-loving men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey dug deeper. &#34;Are you close with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really. Besides the Monday meetings, we just have normal boss-employee chats. I like that he doesn&#39;t make inappropriate jokes. It makes us all feel comfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey nodded. &#34;Got it.&#34; This was definitely different from what the guy had said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder they said women didn&#39;t understand men; only men got men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked, &#34;Lawrence seems great to you. How do you feel about the way he assigns tasks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s fine. He&#39;s the boss, and he always gives us detailed notes. He&#39;s serious about his work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey could tell that if she asked more, the girl would start gushing about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She switched gears. &#34;Did you know he likes to wear women&#39;s clothes in private?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wear women&#39;s clothes?&#34; The girl looked shocked. &#34;A colleague mentioned it once, but I thought it was a joke. Someone as great as him couldn&#39;t do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly added, &#34;Even if he does, so what? You can&#39;t arrest him just because he has a different hobby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey figured there was no point in dragging the conversation on. She thanked the woman with a smile and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman, worried that Lawrence might be in trouble, hesitated and asked, &#34;Is Lawrence in some kind of trouble? If it&#39;s not too much to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey replied firmly, &#34;It&#39;s not something I can discuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey met up with Alexander at the door, and they headed back to the car together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yawned, planning to catch a nap in the passenger seat, but an annoying voice interrupted her. &#34;You&#39;ve been at the police department for so long, and you haven&#39;t changed a bit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey shot back, &#34;And how exactly do my changes concern you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wasn&#39;t thrilled with Zoey&#39;s attitude today. They were cops, and the person they were dealing with could be a key witness. No matter how irritating, Zoey couldn&#39;t just do whatever she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;You just joined the criminal investigation department. Don&#39;t you want to make a good impression on Officer Davis? Aren&#39;t you worried about getting reported?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey shrugged. &#34;Let them report me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t seem to care about anything; don&#39;t you want to stay in the criminal investigation department?&#34; Alexander was at a loss with Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was too reckless. It would catch up with her eventually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, on the other hand, had already turned away, not wanting to deal with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander looked at her lazy profile. Every time he tried to help her, she always acted indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought suddenly crossed his mind. &#34;Do you not want to be a cop anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was fed up with Alexander&#39;s nagging. &#34;Are you meddling too much? Whether I want to be a cop or not is none of your business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remembered how Zoey had snapped at that guy earlier, took a deep breath, and silently pulled the car over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey felt the car stop and slowly opened her eyes, looking in Alexander&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We went through so much at the police academy. Are you serious?&#34; Alexander stared ahead, clearly pissed. &#34;You always wanted to compete the best with me. But what&#39;s the point now? Do you even know what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was beyond frustrated, and anger surged through her. She stared at him for a while, and as Alexander got more worked up and looked back at her, she sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Compete? You think too highly of me. You come from a privileged background; our starting lines aren&#39;t even close. What am I competing with you for? The word &#39;compete&#39; doesn&#39;t even apply to us. Competing is for people on the same level, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey let out a cold laugh and continued, &#34;Maybe in your world, you can&#39;t understand that the high tuition fees of the police academy can crush a family because you&#39;ve never experienced the hardships of the lower class. When you think I&#39;m &#39;competing&#39; with you, I&#39;m actually &#39;competing&#39; with my fate! All my efforts are to earn scholarships every year so I can afford to go to school and sit in that classroom.&#34;</p>
