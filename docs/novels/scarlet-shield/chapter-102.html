                <p>Hugh lifted his head with a sneer, looking at the group without a clue about the seriousness of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arrogance was clear, showing off his sense of superiority at every chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you all show up at my place first thing in the morning. What&#39;s this got to do with us? Even regular jobs start at eight, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cops stood at the factory gate like statues, staring him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weird pressure settled over Hugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he kept up his sarcastic tone, &#34;You guys must have it rough. How much do you make a month? If it&#39;s not enough, come work for me. I could use a few security guards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was about to step forward, but Alexander quickly held her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stepped up with a slight smile, &#34;We can&#39;t compare our paychecks to a big boss like you. We&#39;re questioning everyone in Willowbrook Village, and since this is the village chief&#39;s house, we had to start here. You get it, right? Plus, we know you have a business to run, so we came early to avoid messing up your day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh, hearing this, sarcastically praised Alexander for his thoughtfulness. &#34;Not bad, you got potential. If you ever can&#39;t hack it in the police force, come work for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander smiled, though it seemed fake to others, but Hugh and his mother seemed to like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh&#39;s mother also smiled and said, &#34;Since the cop said so, you should go early and not delay your work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh, seeing his mother speak, responded, &#34;Alright, Mom, I got it. I&#39;ll go now.&#34; He stuffed a large bite of his sandwich into his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Evan was eating, enjoying his meal, shoveling food into his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh&#39;s mother was helping him, and when Evan finished, he yawned and stood up, &#34;Mom, I want to go back to my room and sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Hugh&#39;s mother agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the police weren&#39;t planning to let Evan go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People like him were more likely to slip up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stepped forward with a smile, &#34;Ma&#39;am, he needs to come too, to help us with our work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He needs to go? Why?&#34; Hugh&#39;s mother was highly alert, her actions and expressions showing strong disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear Evan had some intellectual disabilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Hugh&#39;s mother was from the countryside, she knew that they could get much from a simpleton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be safe, she whispered something in Evan&#39;s ear, and he nodded enthusiastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does my brother need to go? Can&#39;t you see he has the intelligence of an eight or nine-year-old? What do you expect to hear from him? If he misleads your investigation, we won&#39;t be responsible,&#34; Hugh said, turning to his mother, &#34;Right, Mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh&#39;s mother could only agree, &#34;Yes, that fever almost took Evan&#39;s life...&#34; She sighed like a worried mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh said, &#34;Mom, you stay with him. I&#39;ll go with them and be back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Hugh&#39;s mother nodded and led Evan to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let him come along. It&#39;s a shame to keep him cooped up inside every day. Don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t do anything to him,&#34; Zoey said, leading the way out of Hugh&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh and Evan followed behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have to bring Evan? What can he understand?&#34; Hugh was getting annoyed, but seeing the police&#39;s determination, he shouted to his mom, &#34;Fine, bring him along! Let&#39;s get this over with, I have work to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Hugh&#39;s mother quickly grabbed a jacket for Evan and let him follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander led the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh and the others followed behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willowbrook Village wasn&#39;t big, and the church was centrally located, so they arrived quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was in a small room next to the church&#39;s main hall, interrogating Chad. He told Alexander to wait in another room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh peeked into the small room, trying to see who was being interrogated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But everything was blocked, and he couldn&#39;t see anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You educated folks sure know how to talk. Am I not the first one? How long do I have to wait?&#34; Hugh asked impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We won&#39;t keep you from work,&#34; Jordan replied, even more impatient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh finally shut his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was curious about the interrogation. She tried to eavesdrop, but the door opened just as she approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert came out, his face burning with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Dennis, who was holding a stranger, and instructed, &#34;Take him out of Willowbrook Village and lock him up at the town police station!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked past Robert and saw Chad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only heard about him from colleagues, thinking he was as disgusting as Hugh. But Chad was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t fat, but extremely thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dark circles were intense, and his face looked like he was on drugs, lifeless and dull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it!&#34; Dennis had been itching to rough up Chad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He deliberately tightened his grip, making Chad yelp in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the pain, or the silver handcuffs counting his sins, but Chad suddenly felt real fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad, who had been calm, suddenly panicked, &#34;No... I can&#39;t be taken in... I have three kids at home. If they lose me, they&#39;ll lose their only family. I... can&#39;t be in trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles, used to seeing people like this, scoffed, &#34;Disgusting. Now you think of your kids? Why didn&#39;t you think of them when you were doing bad things? And what about the kids you hurt? Your kids will be better off without you. They won&#39;t have to take care of you anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad hung his head in shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert, seeing this, felt Chad didn&#39;t deserve to be called a father, and shouted, &#34;Stop wasting time, take him away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; Dennis tightened his grip again and led Chad away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert then noticed Zoey and the others had returned, and asked, &#34;Are they here?&#34;</p>
