                <p>Alexander pulled up the food delivery app on his phone and handed it to Zoey, telling her to order whatever she wanted.</p>

                <p>His long, attractive fingers tapped a few times on the screen, then he looked up and casually asked, &#34;How about some hot cocoa?&#34;</p>

                <p>Zoey, confused, said, &#34;I&#39;ve just never tried hot cocoa; what&#39;s the big deal? I like plain water. Hot cocoa&#39;s pricey and not exactly healthy. Why spend money to feel crappy?&#34;</p>

                <p>Zoey just didn&#39;t see the point in spending a lot of money just to quench her thirst.</p>

                <p>He picked out some of her favorite dishes from their recent meals together and added two cups of hot cocoa for Zoey to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought it was expensive, so she didn&#39;t buy it. Since he bought it, she shouldn&#39;t mind, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried Zoey might not drink it, he also ordered two bottles of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The delivery guy had a tough time finding their location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander talked to him over the phone, giving directions, and they finally met up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander got back to the car with a big bag of food, the car was soon filled with the delicious aroma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All set, let&#39;s eat,&#34; Alexander said, opening the food containers and handing Zoey her utensils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t hold back and started eating right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ate quickly, without any grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t understand how she could eat so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him not eating, Zoey looked up and asked, &#34;Why are you staring at me? Aren&#39;t you eating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Alexander said, picking up his utensils and starting to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Zoey had almost finished eating, Alexander carefully took out the hot cocoa he had bought for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed it to Zoey, &#34;I got this for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey felt a strange emotion she couldn&#39;t quite identify.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took the hot cocoa from him and took a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s pretty good; thanks for the meal,&#34; she said. Then she thought, &#39;No wonder it&#39;s so expensive.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing. We&#39;re colleagues; we should look out for each other,&#34; Alexander said. He found that he enjoyed her compliments more than he expected. He must be crazy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, both of them were full and slumped back in their seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey felt a bit sleepy and wanted to close her eyes for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to rest up and deal with things in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, in the driver&#39;s seat, couldn&#39;t sit still. He flipped through the case files repeatedly, looking for clues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he got sleepy and took out his phone to find a nearby hotel for both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was surprised to find that the drive from here to downtown, and then from downtown to Pleasantville Apartments, took a full hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An idea suddenly popped into his head. He muttered, &#34;If Lawrence drives out every weekend, how does he get back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had almost worn out the surveillance tapes looking for Lawrence, but there was no footage of him returning to the apartment complex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, though her eyes were closed, was also thinking about what Alexander had said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, she answered, &#34;That&#39;s because he never came back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander asked, &#34;You mean, besides Lawrence, there&#39;s someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was now uncertain; these were merely her conjectures. She slowly opened her eyes and said, &#34;Do you recall passing a neighborhood closest to the suburbs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander instantly got it. &#34;Looks like we have more work tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All night, they took turns keeping watch of the car, afraid that the evidence they had found would disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At dawn, Robert finally arrived!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert came to their car window and knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and Zoey, having stayed up all night, looked tired as they rolled down the window to greet Robert, &#34;Officer Davis, you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert said, &#34;Yes, the tech team has started working. You two must be exhausted; go get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and Zoey had more important things to do than rest. Zoey said, &#34;We&#39;ll check the nearby apartment complex first, then we&#39;ll go back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert agreed, &#34;Alright, call if you need help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I think Zoey and I can handle it,&#34; Alexander said, as it was just checking some surveillance footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After talking to Alexander, Robert went back to the warehouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and Zoey drove the car closer to the city. Since it was morning, there were many food vendors on the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bought some food to fill their stomachs and headed to the apartment complex they had passed by earlier to check the surveillance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as they arrived, the security guard stopped them. &#34;Sorry, you&#39;re not residents here; please register.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander parked the car and walked to the security office. Then he showed his badge and easily got the surveillance footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey wanted information on all the residents, but the security guard said, &#34;Officer, we&#39;ve done all we can. Resident information is private, and without a warrant, we can&#39;t give it to you. We&#39;re just employees; we can&#39;t risk it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey thought this apartment complex was pretty good; it was at least better than Pleasantville Apartments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they found any clues in the future, they might get what they needed from the security office, making the investigation easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, thanks for your cooperation.&#34; Alexander understood. They didn&#39;t have solid evidence; otherwise, they wouldn&#39;t be here looking for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After more than an hour, Alexander and Zoey returned to the precinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles saw them and excitedly approached, &#34;We found it! This suspicious car&#39;s movements match Lawrence&#39;s almost exactly! It goes back on Friday nights and comes out on Sunday nights.&#34;</p>
