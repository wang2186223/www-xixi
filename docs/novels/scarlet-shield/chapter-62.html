                <p>Zoey asked again, &#34;What about your family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re out of town, quite far away,&#34; Ruby replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your friend isn&#39;t answering the phone, so you&#39;re just staying outside?&#34; Zoey glanced at the nearby hotels and pointed, &#34;You should find a place to stay with your child. You can&#39;t just wait for your friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey could guess why her friend wasn&#39;t answering the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby was a woman who was often subjected to domestic violence, and she could always talk about her inner turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first time, her friend might be sympathetic, feeling sorry for her and taking her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second time, maybe the same, but by the third or fourth time, she would think Ruby was particularly annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby slowly lowered her head, &#34;I have no money. All the money at home has been squandered by him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at Ruby and frowned, &#34;You don&#39;t even have money for a hotel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I have less than a hundred dollars left. I thought it would be enough for the next few days, but who knew... I can&#39;t even afford a cab now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where does your friend live? Even if you take a tour around the city, it shouldn&#39;t cost more than fifty dollars.&#34; Zoey was now a bit speechless with herself, wondering why she got out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I get a hotel, I won&#39;t have money for food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked her unnecessarily, glancing at her, &#34;Oh, then you figure it out yourself. I&#39;m leaving now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t that she was heartless, but she also had no money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And her salary barely covered her own living expenses. If she gave it to Ruby, she would go hungry. So she decided to stay out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to leave, but Ruby called out to her, &#34;Officer Brown, wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey turned back, giving her a cold look, &#34;What&#39;s the matter? I have no money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s not about money. Can you help me talk to my husband? My child has school tomorrow, and I haven&#39;t heard from my friend. I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey guessed her intention, and she hated this kind of thing the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied extremely coldly, &#34;Sorry, I&#39;m off duty now. If you need help, call 911. It&#39;s free to call 911&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby didn&#39;t expect that this young-looking girl, who was also a police officer, would have no sympathy at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey responded to her so coldly. But Ruby had no one else to turn to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only cry and beg Zoey to help her. She was about to grab Zoey&#39;s clothes, but Zoey quickly dodged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Officer Brown, I called the cop earlier today. We&#39;ve met.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I said I&#39;m off duty. If you need anything, call 911.&#34; Zoey watched her cry even more, and everyone passing by glanced at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Officer Brown, can&#39;t you just be kind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faced with Ruby&#39;s repeated pleas, Zoey&#39;s attitude became even more unkind, &#34;You reported domestic violence, and we have handled it. You reconciled in front of us, and we gave you a warning. You said you didn&#39;t need it, right? Now, after leaving the police station, you got beaten again, and you don&#39;t want a divorce. You want me to plead with your husband? Plead for what? For him to hit you lighter next time? Isn&#39;t this your own doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby felt even worse being lectured by a young girl like Zoey. &#34;Officer Brown, you can say this because you&#39;re young, inexperienced, and not married, so I don&#39;t blame you. When you get married and have kids, you&#39;ll understand. Divorce isn&#39;t that easy. My daughter is still young. Having a father is better than not having one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey wouldn&#39;t be convinced by Ruby&#39;s foolishness, &#34;So, you think your so-called motherly love is great? You&#39;d rather let her have a father like that than admit she&#39;s living in an unhealthy family? In such a family, what&#39;s the difference between having a father and not having one?&#34; Zoey really wanted to laugh at Ruby, who was extremely foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby thought of all she had endured for her child over the years, and Zoey&#39;s words made her cry even more, &#34;No, when you have kids, you&#39;ll understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t want to hear about her misfortune. She had already been bothered by Emma today and didn&#39;t want to be bothered a second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Emma had paid for it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s eyes unconsciously looked at the girl Ruby was holding. The girl seemed numb to Ruby&#39;s crying. There was no trace of the innocence and liveliness of a seven or eight-year-old on her face instead with indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her indifferent eyes were very out of place on a seven or eight-year-old girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, she was blinking and looking at the unfamiliar Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t want to deal with Ruby&#39;s foolishness and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Officer Brown!&#34; Ruby called out to Zoey again, &#34;For the sake of us both being women, please help me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey hated people who were foolish and wanted others to be foolish with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her patience had reached its limit, &#34;Can&#39;t you still go to your friend&#39;s place?&#34; With that, she left without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t care about Ruby crying and shouting her name repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was afraid of being stuck with her, so she quickened her pace and returned to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was smoking. When he saw her return, he stubbed out the cigarette with his foot and asked, &#34;Who was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey got into the passenger seat first, and Robert followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She briefly recounted the situation to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it, Officer Davis,&#34; Zoey said as if reporting for duty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing it, Robert didn&#39;t find it surprising, &#34;Domestic violence is common. Not just in your precinct, but even in our criminal investigation department, we get a few domestic violence cases every year. But you know, the ones that reach us are usually where the man accidentally kills the woman, or the woman can&#39;t take it anymore and kills the man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged helplessly, &#34;The funniest thing about these cases is that when we ask the suspects why they didn&#39;t just get a divorce instead of killing, they all say they wouldn&#39;t divorce. Isn&#39;t that ridiculous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Zoey felt she could relate to Robert. Because it was indeed ridiculous!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She commented, &#34;Those who don&#39;t get divorced are asking for it. If they are willing to bear it, there&#39;s no need to report it. Who has time to listen to their suffering?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. There&#39;s a book that says marriage is a woman&#39;s second choice,&#34; Robert suddenly got serious and advised Zoey, &#34;So, you better be careful when choosing a boyfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had never included having a boyfriend in her life plan, let alone getting married and having kids.</p>
