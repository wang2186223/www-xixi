                <p>Zoey&#39;s mind was racing with thoughts of solving the case. She flipped through the diary over and over until she landed on one particular page.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, check this out,&#34; she said, showing the others. &#34;See the last entry? It must&#39;ve been written right before Sadie died. She asked Faye to take her out, probably to meet the killer, but Sadie didn&#39;t know that. And look here,&#34; She flipped to an earlier page, &#34;they were supposed to listen to Rilla&#39;s story, but then a page is missing, and the date skips a day. What&#39;s on that missing page? It&#39;s important. They kept mentioning going to hear stories. What kind of stories? And why hadn&#39;t Faye heard any stories before she was attacked? The diary doesn&#39;t mention it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and Jordan, who had been lost in their grief, snapped out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander frowned slightly. &#34;Rilla was the one who reported the crime and the first to give a statement, but she never mentioned telling stories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey closed the diary. &#34;Exactly. Everyone in the village knows each other because there are only a few dozen families. Rilla is also connected to Janet and the Lynns&#39; daughters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s not waste any more time. Let&#39;s go find Rilla,&#34; Jordan suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They quickly gathered their things and headed to Rilla&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours had passed since they had read the diary, and the sky was gradually darkening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan felt increasingly uneasy as they walked. &#34;The three victims didn&#39;t seem to have any connection to Rilla. It&#39;s not like Rilla would lure them out at night to tell them stories and then kill them. She&#39;s not strong enough to hang them up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t make sense for Rilla to be the killer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why had she hidden the fact that she told stories when they first met her? Did she think the stories were irrelevant to the case?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan&#39;s mind was a jumble of thoughts, trying to piece together the clues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander suddenly said, &#34;Rilla is the only girl in the village who went to college.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So? Does that mean she&#39;s a great storyteller?&#34; Jordan&#39;s straightforwardness made Alexander chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander smiled mysteriously. &#34;Maybe enchanting stories have a kind of magic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan was confused. &#34;What?&#34;Soon, they arrived at Rilla&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla was sitting in the yard, engrossed in a book. From their angle, they could see that Rilla had an air about her that set her apart from the other villagers. Now they understood why. She had a college education.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More knowledge and experiences had shaped Rilla&#39;s worldview, making her different from the rest of Willowbrook Village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they could speak, Rilla noticed them. She placed a bookmark in her book and stood up slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey immediately recognized the book in Rilla&#39;s hand: &#34;Little Women&#34; by Veridian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, What can I do for you?&#34; Rilla greeted, trying to keep it casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t seem surprised or nervous about their visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rilla,&#34; Alexander said politely. &#34;We just have a few more questions about some details we might have missed last time. Is now a good time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla glanced inside the house, as if checking on someone, then nodded. &#34;Sure, go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey took out the Lynns&#39; daughters&#39; diary and waved it. &#34;You show up a lot in the Lynns&#39; daughters&#39; diary. They often mentioned you telling them stories. Could you tell us what kind of stories you told them? I&#39;m curious to know what made Sadie praise you so much in her diary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla&#39;s expression remained neutral, but there was no smile. &#34;They were just simple stories for kids who hadn&#39;t seen much of the world. Those stories would be jokes to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey pressed on, &#34;I like jokes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Rilla felt helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla glanced at &#34;Little Women&#34; beside her chair. &#34;Nothing special, just stories from this book. You&#39;ve probably heard them before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear she was being evasive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and the others weren&#39;t fooled by her little tricks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged glances, and Alexander stepped forward. &#34;Rilla, where were you between 11 PM and 3 AM on the night of the 20th?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At home, sleeping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any witnesses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve always had my own room. My parents might count as witnesses. Our door was broken and made a lot of noise if opened. If I went out at night, my parents would know. You can ask them if they heard anything that night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan went to check the broken door. It indeed made a loud noise when opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was that loud during the day, it would be even louder at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla was telling the truth. She had an alibi. If she had gone out, her parents and even the neighbors would have heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey received Jordan&#39;s confirmation and turned back to Rilla. &#34;I have a question that might seem trivial to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did they come to hear your stories together or one by one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla replied, &#34;Farmwork keeps people busy. Sometimes they came together, sometimes just the Lynns&#39; daughters if Janet was busy. They&#39;d pester me for stories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many times did they come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About a dozen times.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan asked, &#34;You must have become friends by then, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Girls could become friends quickly, often with just a few words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet and the Lynns&#39; daughters visited often, so they must have shared a lot with Rilla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla&#39;s answer was vague. &#34;Sort of.&#34;</p>
