                <p>As Robert drove, he casually asked, &#34;Zoey, how&#39;s your work at the Riverside Police Department?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey assumed Robert was just trying to make conversation. Fearing the journey would be too monotonous, he deliberately engaged in conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;It&#39;s okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert asked, &#34;Getting along with your colleagues?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;It&#39;s okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert fell silent. When she wasn&#39;t working on a case, Zoey reverted to her cold demeanor. How was he supposed to bring it up with her being so cold?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, they were approaching the Riverside Police Department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey knew this route well; it was always terribly congested during workdays.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Robert insisted on driving her, she might be late and it would waste his time. So she softly said, &#34;Officer Davis, you can drop me off here. It&#39;s always jammed ahead at this time; I can walk the rest of the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert glanced at the traffic ahead; they were at an intersection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had the day off, so he didn&#39;t mind waiting, but Zoey being late wouldn&#39;t be good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert said, &#34;Alright, call me when you get off work; I&#39;ll come pick you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey expressed her gratitude. &#34;Okay, thank you, Officer Davis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t returned to the police station for some time, but upon revisiting the Riverside Police Department, she was unexpectedly overwhelmed with a sense of familiarity and nostalgia. Maybe it was because the high-intensity work in the criminal investigation department contrasted perfectly with the calm here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at her desk, she did a quick disinfecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Riverside Police Department was always quite relaxed, with almost nothing to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After tidying up, she opened her laptop, thinking of updating her novel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she started typing, a face popped up beside her laptop. Emma had come over to her desk and took a look, asking, &#34;You&#39;re back? Did you catch the killer? So quickly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey glanced at her. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Emma was having dinner in the cafeteria last night, she intermittently overheard others mentioning that Zoey had discovered new clues in the stalking case, successfully solved a series of serial murders, and restored peace to the entire city. It was a major case in criminal investigations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was consumed with jealousy, as she had always considered Zoey the most idle member of the Riverside Police Department, assigned only to trivial cases. She didn&#39;t expect that this case would turn out to be a series of serial murders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had stolen all the limelight. If Zoey got a permanent position, it would be a done deal. Zoey might even get a permanent position faster than her. Why? How did such a good thing happen to her! Emma was almost driven crazy by this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma felt an overwhelming urge to strangle Zoey, and her smile was a bit forced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had long seen through her little schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Emma liked to keep up the act. &#34;Can you tell me about the process? The suspect was so cunning; how did you catch him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey only wanted to update her novel and didn&#39;t want to bother with her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seeing the eager look in Emma&#39;s eyes, she decided to tease her, &#34;I just followed the clues and found him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t get the answer she wanted and was infurious. Zoey was doing this on purpose, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was quite tempted to confront Zoey, but the thought of the neighboring table&#39;s astonishment when discussing the matter intrigued her even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a fellow intern, she hadn&#39;t even seen a dead body yet; while Zoey had already solved a case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Emma feel balanced? Knowing Zoey was like this, she continued to ask, &#34;Can you tell me in detail? Everyone&#39;s talking about it like it&#39;s a miracle. I heard it was dismemberment? How did you find the body parts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey hated trouble. Emma was now a &#39;trouble.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her side gig as an online novelist earned her at least two thousand dollars a month. If Emma kept talking, she might not make that money if she had work in the afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had work in the afternoon, she wouldn&#39;t be able to update. Then she wouldn&#39;t have money today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at the empty word count on her laptop, then at Emma&#39;s eager face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;Sure, I can tell you everything you want to know. As detailed as you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? That&#39;s great. Thanks, Zoey.&#34; Emma pulled up a chair, ready to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s expression turned cold. &#34;But you have to pay me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s smile froze, blinking, not understanding what she meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was confused and asked,  &#34;I have to pay to hear a story? Or is it confidential? Are you afraid I&#39;ll leak it? Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey remained unmoved and stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You misunderstood me,&#34; she explained. &#34;The story you want to hear cost me several sleepless nights and a lot of effort with my colleagues. You think you can just listen for free? Am I that idle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma thought she was joking at first, but Zoey didn&#39;t seem to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re colleagues and schoolmates, right? You don&#39;t have to be like this...&#34; she started to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey cut her off, &#34;Stop with the nonsense; pay up if you want to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was silent. She hated Zoey but she really wanted to hear the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked Zoey, &#34;How much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey replied, &#34;Two hundred and fifty dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was furious but helpless as she remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she hesitated between getting angry and not, Zoey had already taken out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the payment app and held it out to her. The amount was exactly two hundred and fifty dollars.</p>
