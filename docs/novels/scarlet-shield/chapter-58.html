                <p>Zoey suddenly interjected, &#34;Did she say that the child is still young and can&#39;t be without a father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma asked, &#34;How do you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to Emma&#39;s agitation, Zoey seemed very calm. &#34;It&#39;s very common. This is just foolish thinking. In 2022, the domestic violence rate in Veridian was as high as 35.7%, which means that out of every ten couples, three have domestic violence issues. Ninety percent of those who don&#39;t get divorced stay together because the children are still young.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma had no idea where she got this data from. &#34;Really? I don&#39;t see many cases around me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at her like she was an idiot. &#34;Because you live in the city! If you grew up in a more rural area, you would know. These things are common. The first time a woman gets beaten, she might think about divorce, but the moment she sees her child or her husband sincerely apologizes afterward, she softens and forgives him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, &#34;Almost every time, they convince themselves in this cyclical way. After repeating it so many times, they become numb and start to accept it, thinking this is the marriage God gave them, and they have to accept it. In reality, they just lack courage. And even if someone is being abused, do you think they would tell you? Those who don&#39;t want a divorce always hide it. Who would share their misfortune with you? Those who truly understand and want a divorce, you&#39;ll find out they&#39;ve been abused for years, almost beaten to death, and can&#39;t take it anymore before they finally get divorced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Emma felt like she and Zoey lived in different worlds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma asked, &#34;Why can&#39;t they just leave decisively the first time they are unlawfully harmed? Why wait until they are almost beaten to death?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t want to bother with Emma, this fool, but remembering the hundred dollars she received, she patiently gave her a lesson. &#34;Isn&#39;t it because they&#39;re stupid? They believe a man will change for them. Abusive men take advantage of their weakness and inability to leave, so they escalate. You haven&#39;t seen those women who are almost beaten to death, still begging their husbands not to leave them. Do you know why their husbands beat them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was full of confusion. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey replied, &#34;Because their husbands fell in love with someone else and forced them to divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was silent, because she couldn&#39;t understand it completely. She said, &#34;I used to think our country&#39;s laws were really biased towards women, but now it seems that sometimes it&#39;s not that the law can&#39;t protect them, it&#39;s that they are willing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing we can do,&#34; Zoey said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, most of them were willing. They thought how hard their life was, and they endured it all for the sake of their children. Some of them even thought that the person trying to persuade them was the one with the problem, rather than considering that they might have been at fault themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma took a deep breath. &#34;Isn&#39;t there any way to save them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save them? The country&#39;s laws have always been trying to save them!&#34; Zoey pursed her lips. &#34;When we encounter such situations, we just respect their choice and hope they stay together forever, so those bad guys don&#39;t harm other women.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was very disdainful of Zoey&#39;s indifferent attitude. &#34;We are cops! How can you say such cold words?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma really couldn&#39;t understand why Zoey could be so calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so agitated that her voice was much louder than before, causing many people in the office to look in their direction instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zoey, I thought Mr. Williams was a man, so he would side with men, but we are both women. We need to make these ignorant women realize the importance of the situation, don&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish her words, a slap landed on Emma&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was stunned for a while before she reacted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t show any sign of apology. &#34;Calm down, can&#39;t you see you&#39;re disturbing others&#39; work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to get angry, but seeing the eyes of the people around her, she realized she was indeed disturbing others&#39; work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hand she wanted to raise was put down again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slap from Zoey wasn&#39;t very painful, so she probably didn&#39;t mean anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that she finally quieted down, Zoey said softly, &#34;I haven&#39;t finished speaking, why are you in such a hurry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next is the paid knowledge content.&#34; Zoey smiled at her. &#34;Whether you listen or not is completely voluntary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was a bit impulsive. Maybe the previous $250 made her feel it was worth it. She said without hesitation, &#34;Just say it, how much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you&#39;re a repeat customer, I&#39;ll give you a 50% discount, $100.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma didn&#39;t hesitate and transferred $100.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, seeing her balance increase by another $100, began to explain to Emma with satisfaction. &#34;Actually, it&#39;s very simple. When you take on such cases, you need to have your own judgment. First, listen to what their relationship is really about and why the woman is being beaten. If the man has a temper problem but no other bad habits, and the woman has forgiven him several times, and she tells you that he&#39;s very good to her when he&#39;s not having an episode, you don&#39;t need to listen to her follow-up. Stand on the woman&#39;s side and advise her to divorce. Usually, after leaving the police station, the two will reconcile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If the woman is beaten because of infidelity, I think this is very simple to handle, and you don&#39;t need me to teach you. If a couple has always had a good relationship and suddenly fights, and the man pushes the woman, and she wants a divorce, just stay away. Eighty percent of the time, the woman won&#39;t divorce; she&#39;s just spoiled and can&#39;t stand grievances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, there&#39;s another kind, like the case you encountered today. If you sincerely advise them, and they really get divorced, the man might think you ruined his family and might even retaliate against you. He will never think he&#39;s wrong. Ms. Moore&#39;s husband today is a typical example.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just follow the procedure, both parties need to make a statement. After that, issue a domestic violence warning. If there are injuries, issue a medical examination form. If the injuries are serious, he can be detained and imprisoned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But usually, it&#39;s useless. If they have children, they will consider that a criminal record for the man will be bad for the child&#39;s future. But we have to be responsible, and some procedures must be followed even if we don&#39;t want to. When she wants to leave, just tell her that if she can endure it this time, don&#39;t call the cop next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma thought she heard wrong. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
