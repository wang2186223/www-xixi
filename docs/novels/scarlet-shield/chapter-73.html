                <p>Lucille started packing again, but after less than three seconds, she thought of another question. &#34;By the way, Officer Brown, what if he doesn&#39;t agree to the divorce? After all, I don&#39;t think anyone but me could choose him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can file for divorce. You have the injury report as evidence of his domestic violence, and there&#39;s also the police statement. That&#39;s enough.&#34; Zoey added, &#34;If he keeps pestering you and refuses to divorce, just call me directly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay!&#34; Lucille quickly finished packing, mostly cat supplies which were easier to pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her struggling, Zoey helped her carry some of the items.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They chatted as they went downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey added, &#34;After you and Paul ended up at the police station last time, did you tell your parents about Paul abusing you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Mentioning this, Lucille&#39;s eyes dimmed again. &#34;Sigh, my hometown is in the North, and I married far away. I regretted it so much, wondering why I married far away. It&#39;s all fate, I just consider myself unlucky. Besides, my parents didn&#39;t even know we got married. After getting the marriage certificate, I told them, and they were furious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I even argued with them, insisting I would be happy. Look at me, how long have I been married? And now this happens. How can I face my parents? They knew I married Paul, bought tickets, and flew over to scold me, but it was too late. We were already married. I still remember on the wedding day, my mom cried so much and kept hitting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Although my mom was angry with me, she still cared about me. She told me to come home if I was wronged. They will always be my strongest support. I should really listen to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Lucille said this, tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey could tell that Lucille had realized she should listen to her parents. &#34;It&#39;s never too late to realize that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, but I still feel a bit wronged. You know, I&#39;m the only child in my family, and my parents doted on me. But after getting married, Paul beat me and I became his free maid. Thinking about it makes me want to cry. Damn it, I really deserve this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey comforted her, &#34;Haven&#39;t you already figured it out? Realizing it is cutting your losses in time. You still have a long life ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you&#39;re right. As long as I want to start over, now is the best time.&#34; Lucille wiped her tears, looking like a strong girl. &#34;Alright, Officer Brown, I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hailed a taxi and put the cat supplies in the trunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything was ready, she waved to Zoey through the car window, &#34;Everything&#39;s packed, and I&#39;ve paid, Officer Brown.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the driver was about to leave, Zoey rolled down the window and asked, &#34;By the way, Lucille, you haven&#39;t told me your cat&#39;s name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s called Big Baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded and said goodbye to Lucille.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey watched the cat fall into thought as the car slowly started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she got home, it was almost midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought Robert and Tenley would already be asleep, so she asked the driver to drive quietly to avoid disturbing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, as soon as the car stopped, she saw Robert and Tenley standing at the entrance, seemingly waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey opened the car door and got out. Tenley looked around and asked, &#34;Zoey, where&#39;s the cat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here.&#34; Zoey handed over the pet carrier next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley took it and lifted the white cloth on top, looking at the pet cat inside with great affection. Her loving gaze didn&#39;t seem fake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So cute. Robert, look, a pet cat. Its eyes are like gems.&#34; The more Tenley looked, the more she liked it. Robert glanced at it and silently went to the trunk to get the other cat supplies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After bringing everything upstairs, Tenley placed the cat on the balcony. &#34;We used to keep our cat here. It&#39;s been years, so there shouldn&#39;t be any scent left. It shouldn&#39;t feel threatened and can have a good night&#39;s sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, knowing nothing about pets, changed the subject. &#34;Mrs. Davis, is it okay for it to sleep in the carrier for a night? Won&#39;t it suffocate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, this thing is breathable. This carrier is nice and easy to open. Look, just press here.&#34; Tenley pressed a button, and the carrier opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kitten lazily stretched its paws and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked around the environment without any signs of unfamiliarity, strutting around the room as if it owned the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley laughed, amused by the kitten. &#34;This little thing is too cute. Zoey, what&#39;s its name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s called Big Baby.&#34; Zoey reluctantly said the name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Lucille&#39;s personality, she could come up with such a name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a nice name, haha, Big Baby.&#34; Tenley teased it like a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kitten responded to Tenley&#39;s calls with meows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Zoey, who disliked cats, found this kitten quite adorable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is so cute, smart, and lovable.&#34; Tenley couldn&#39;t get enough of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to the kitten, Zoey felt a bit neglected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey yawned and was about to go to her bedroom to sleep when she saw the kitten suddenly jump off Tenley&#39;s lap, looking uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley missed catching it and grabbed at the air. &#34;Oh no, Big Baby, what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kitten, not understanding human speech, jumped to the floor and kept meowing, searching for something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, suddenly alert, turned and asked with concern, &#34;Mrs. Davis, are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. It probably needs to use the restroom.&#34; Tenley, clearly experienced with pets, instantly understood the kitten&#39;s intention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to set up a litter box for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smelling the litter, the kitten jumped in and started using it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing, it even covered its waste with its little paws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley liked it even more, holding it in her arms and stroking it. &#34;Big Baby, you are so great and know how to use the restroom. Your owner must be amazing to train you so well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kitten lay quietly in her arms, looking very content.</p>
