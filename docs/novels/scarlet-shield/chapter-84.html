                <p>&#34;If you had gone, you wouldn&#39;t be as carefree as you are now. Plus, dealing with a body disposal case, not only is it difficult, but the pay is also low. It&#39;s basically doing dirty and tiring work for the least amount of money.&#34; Emma added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey replied. &#34;That&#39;s still better than dealing with these stupid things. I&#39;d rather stay up late and use my brain than explain things to these clueless people every day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right about that.&#34; Emma had also grown tired of handling civil disputes lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every day it was trivial matters, taking up two-thirds of her work time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some older people were even more stubborn; they couldn&#39;t be reasoned with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard from my classmates back in school that you were quite annoying. After working with you for so long, I found out you really are annoying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey smiled slightly. &#34;It&#39;s fine now, I&#39;m just about to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was silent; that wasn&#39;t what she meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly stood up and called out to Zoey. &#34;Can you let me finish speaking? I think you&#39;re a bit different from how they described you. That adjective is obviously exaggerated. Although you can be annoying sometimes, I don&#39;t dislike you that much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, whether you like me or not, what does it have to do with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t we friends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean, Zoey!&#34; Emma was very angry. &#34;Aren&#39;t we friends? If we weren&#39;t friends, why would you talk to me so much? Why would you teach me how to handle civil disputes? If we weren&#39;t friends, why would you accompany me to Ruby&#39;s when I was at a loss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faced with Emma&#39;s accusations, Zoey was a bit surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was nice to Emma because Emma gave her money. And handling Ruby&#39;s matter was just work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at Emma&#39;s expression and knew Emma was reluctant to see her go. She just had a strong personality when speaking. From the Ruby incident, it was clear she was a kind-hearted girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Emma, well, she didn&#39;t dislike her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just kidding, we are friends.&#34; Zoey was afraid Emma would really cry and she wouldn&#39;t know how to handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Emma held back her tears. &#34;Hmph! That&#39;s more like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was amused by Emma&#39;s proud yet reluctant expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma brought up Ruby again. &#34;By the way, Ruby...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need to talk about Ruby. She brought it on herself. I don&#39;t want to waste my precious life listening to her nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma responded. &#34;Then let&#39;s not talk about her. But Ruby&#39;s parents seem to love their granddaughter very much. They took the child away. I hope she will be happy in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good.&#34; Just as Zoey finished speaking, she received a message from Robert saying they were already outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma reluctantly saw her to the door. &#34;When you&#39;re not busy, you can call me, and we can go shopping or have coffee together. Don&#39;t act cold. If I text you and you don&#39;t reply, I&#39;ll come to the detective bureau! You won&#39;t be able to work properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t say anything, silently moving her things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma tugged at her sleeve, pouting. &#34;I hate goodbyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not like we won&#39;t see each other again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s true, but if we&#39;re both busy, especially you, when will we have time to get together?&#34; Emma sighed deeply, then suddenly leaned close to Zoey and said. &#34;I heard there are a lot of handsome guys in the detective team. Help me pick a few. I like the ones who look really strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OK.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t have many things, and it didn&#39;t take long to move them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert&#39;s trunk was just the right size.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey hugged Emma goodbye and got into Robert&#39;s car, officially becoming a member of the first detective team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been here before as an intern, so she wasn&#39;t too nervous about starting the job since she was already familiar with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Robert, she smoothly arrived at their detective team&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she opened the door, she saw Alexander and the others holding a banner, each holding a corner, looking somewhat comical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It read: [Welcome the Excellent Ms. Brown to the First Detective Team.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that, Zoey was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she sure she was joining the first detective team?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles immediately handed her a bouquet of flowers. She didn&#39;t know the name of the flowers, but they smelled particularly fragrant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome, Zoey, to the first detective team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; The flowers hadn&#39;t even warmed up in her arms before Charles took them back. &#34;There&#39;s a vase over there. I&#39;ll put them in for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey noticed that the desks had been rearranged, and her spot was by the window, looking very bright, spacious, and clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately liked her new office environment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert pointed to her spot and patted her shoulder. &#34;Work hard, and aim to get promoted with Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander smiled gently at Zoey and responded to Robert. &#34;Luckily, there are two promotion spots. Otherwise, with Zoey&#39;s excellence, I wouldn&#39;t stand a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey glanced at him. &#34;As long as you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was silent; he had brought this on himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could never win an argument with Zoey, but he just wanted to tease her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey placed her things on her desk and quickly organized them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t give Alexander a single glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first few days of work were almost uneventful, not busy at all, just sorting through old case files with Alexander and explaining them to the newcomers. So they left work on time every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille, after sorting out the house, also took her cat away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley, back home, often sighed when looking at the places the cat used to stay. Robert told Zoey. &#34;See, she wants to get a pet again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pets could be a source of emotional support; it was very healing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey guessed that maybe because Kelvin had been away from them for too long, Tenley used pets to ease her longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When we have a break, let&#39;s get her a pet to cheer her up.&#34; Just as she finished speaking, Robert received an order to go on a business trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Willowbrook Village? Where is it? Is it in our area? I&#39;ve never heard of it.&#34; Dennis muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles immediately opened the web and searched for Willowbrook Village. Information about it quickly popped up. &#34;It&#39;s in Suncrest City. How remote!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Suncrest City?&#34; Dennis knew the place; it was far from their area. &#34;Why is the higher-up sending Officer Davis there? What does it have to do with him? Is it some kind of team-building event?&#34;</p>
