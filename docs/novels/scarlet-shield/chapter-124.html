                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t tell Rilla. I&#39;m scared she&#39;ll hate me. I&#39;m so sad. Ever since Hugh let his dad hurt me, they&#39;ve been keeping a close eye on me, not letting me go anywhere. No matter where I go, Ava&#39;s always right behind me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only thing that makes me happy is talking to Rilla, but even then, Ava&#39;s there. I don&#39;t get why they&#39;re following me. Are they scared I&#39;ll spill the beans about the awful stuff they&#39;ve done to me? I will, I swear, if it comes to that. They don&#39;t need to do this. I have nowhere to go if I leave them. I have no money, nothing. Hugh&#39;s never given me anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ava even told me she&#39;s had a bunch of abortions and once abandoned a newborn girl. She said if I have a girl, I should abandon her too. When I heard that, I wondered if my parents ditched me because I was a girl. Is that why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always thought of myself as a happy, positive person. Being an orphan didn&#39;t matter, even if my parents didn&#39;t want me. At least they didn&#39;t abort me; they brought me into this world. But now, after everything I&#39;ve been through, all I feel is hate. If they didn&#39;t love me, why didn&#39;t they just kill me sooner? Why make me go through all this? I&#39;d rather be dead. Maybe they should have never let me live. I hate my parents now, I really do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder if I did something terrible in a past life to deserve being born a woman in this one. Would things be different if I were a man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The other night, Hugh forced me to sleep with his dad again. Just seeing his dad&#39;s face makes me sick. Before, he would just have sex with me, but now it&#39;s worse. He kisses me, touches me, even licks my pussy. He makes disgusting comments about my body. I can&#39;t take it anymore. I tried to fight back, but I was too weak. He licked me all over while raping me. I wanted to throw up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I got back to my room after being with Hugh&#39;s dad, Hugh wasn&#39;t home yet. I lay down and threw up. I thought it was because I was so disgusted, but I was wrong. I&#39;ve been throwing up a lot lately. I don&#39;t need a test to know I&#39;m probably pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a feeling it&#39;s a girl. Ava won&#39;t let her be born, and I won&#39;t either. I can&#39;t protect her; I can&#39;t even protect myself. Even if I did protect her, would she end up like me when she grows up? I don&#39;t want my daughter to suffer in this world. Death is the best choice for her while she can&#39;t feel pain or sadness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rilla once told me that everyone&#39;s fate is different, but death is fair. Everyone dies, rich or poor, young or old. If I&#39;m going to die eventually, why not now? Why suffer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to die right now, but I can&#39;t bear to leave Rilla. She&#39;s my best friend. We promised to see the ocean together someday. We made so many beautiful plans, but will they ever happen to me? I don&#39;t believe they will. They never will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rilla, I&#39;m going ahead. I didn&#39;t want to record this video, but I realized if I just died, there would be no trace of me left in this world. I know you might never see this, and no one might ever find it. But Rilla, you&#39;re the best friend I&#39;ve ever had. I can&#39;t hold on anymore. I hope you can forgive me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been having these dreams lately, and someone keeps telling me to go with them. I can&#39;t see their face, but I feel like it&#39;s a good place, better than where I am now. I&#39;ve decided to go with them, to leave forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The video ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Haven&#39;s sobs faded, but everyone who watched the video fell into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This &#39;suicide note&#39; made everyone feel her pain firsthand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without this video, everyone might have thought Haven just left, not that she committed suicide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to the other women in Willowbrook Village, Zoey couldn&#39;t even judge Haven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed clear-headed, yet she did something so tragic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At such a young age, she chose to end everything with suicide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey stared at the video, unable to snap out of it, thinking when the bias against women would end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Haven committed suicide, the detectives wished, even for a moment, that Hugh and his family had been the ones to kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real culprits couldn&#39;t be brought to justice!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, this video is useless, right?&#34; Zoey returned to the case, her cold voice contrasting sharply with the others&#39; complex expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if she had just watched an ordinary video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan&#39;s heavy heart hadn&#39;t lightened. Seeing Zoey speak first, she sighed deeply, &#34;At least we know what happened to Haven, even though...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at least they knew if she was alive or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert thought he&#39;d seen enough to not get angry over these things, but he was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing Haven&#39;s story, even as a cop, he wanted to kill everyone who had hurt Haven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he couldn&#39;t do that. He sighed heavily and looked at his team. &#34;Alright, we don&#39;t know if the syringe will help, but we can start by taking Olivia&#39;s statement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go!&#34; Zoey volunteered immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert didn&#39;t refuse. &#34;Alright, let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they entered, Olivia was asleep at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert cleared his throat, but Olivia didn&#39;t wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had to nudge her awake. &#34;Olivia? Wake up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia wasn&#39;t deeply asleep. She yawned and slowly lifted her head, looking at them with drooping eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert looked at Olivia, thought for a moment, and decided to try a different approach. &#34;Olivia, we know everything. We&#39;re willing to give you a chance to come clean. It&#39;s up to you if you want to take it. You can also choose to say nothing. It&#39;s your choice.&#34;</p>
