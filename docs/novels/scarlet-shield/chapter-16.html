                <p>Dennis, with his small eyes, couldn&#39;t help but roll them at Charles. &#34;Man, the only thing you&#39;ve got going for you is your eyesight,&#34; he sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles just shrugged, thinking Dennis was just being a hater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey suddenly had a lightbulb moment. She grabbed her notebook and showed everyone the bus and subway routes Ella usually took, all from memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she was onto something big, but it turned out to be a dead end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, she turned to Charles. &#34;Hey, can you help me find Ella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure thing,&#34; Charles replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up a photo of Ella and scanned the surveillance footage. In no time, he spotted a familiar figure leaning against the door. &#34;Check it out, is this her? The height and outfit look about right, but she seems a bit shorter from this angle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey zoomed in and squinted at the screen, scrutinizing the figure Charles pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the image was blurry, she recognized Ella right away. After all, they&#39;d interacted a few times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey gave Charles a thumbs-up. &#34;Nice job, man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles blushed a little. &#34;It&#39;s my only talent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without it, he wouldn&#39;t have lasted long in the criminal investigation department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella had told Zoey she was harassed just before getting off the bus. Zoey pulled up the bus schedule and rewound the footage by half an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched the footage frame by frame, starting from when Ella was about to get off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the last five minutes, the bus made a stop, and a bunch of new passengers got on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey zeroed in on the guys closest to Ella. One was a chubby middle-aged dude who looked kinda sketchy. The other was a sharp-dressed guy with a briefcase, clearly an office worker. Both were glued to their phones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the bus jolted for some reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at Ella&#39;s face again and saw pure panic. To be sure, she rewound the footage and watched it in slow motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, taller people around her blocked Ella&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her body language, it was clear she was trying to move away from her spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This reaction was a dead giveaway. She must&#39;ve been harassed when the bus shook!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s attention went back to the two men next to Ella, but they were still just playing with their phones, not giving anything away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were too many people, and all she could see were heads. Everything below their shoulders was hidden, so she couldn&#39;t tell if their other hands were up to something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footage caught the chubby guy&#39;s face but missed the office worker&#39;s. Still, Zoey was sure the office worker wasn&#39;t Lawrence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their hairstyles and outfits were different, and even though those could be changed, their body types were too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey furrowed her brow, doubting her earlier guesses. Maybe the harassment was just a fluke?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and decided to call Ella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella, knowing the creep who&#39;d been stalking her was caught the day she was hospitalized, was in a much better mood. She was enjoying her time off and sounded pretty cheerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she saw Zoey&#39;s call, she put down what she was doing and answered, &#34;Hey, Officer Brown, what&#39;s up? Need my help with something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Zoey replied. &#34;Are you free right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella washed her hands and said, &#34;Yep, I&#39;m on vacation today, just chilling at home. I was about to cook.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great, can I steal about ten minutes of your time?&#34; Zoey asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, no problem!&#34; Ella dried her hands and plopped down on the sofa, ready for Zoey&#39;s questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s voice came through the phone. &#34;You mentioned before that you were sexually harassed. I need some more details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella said, &#34;Sure, ask away. I&#39;ll tell you everything I remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey thought about the surveillance footage and asked, &#34;I&#39;m looking at the bus footage. I saw a few guys standing near you, two of them really close. Do you remember them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella thought for a moment. &#34;Kinda. One was a middle-aged guy, and the other was around my age, maybe a bit older. I even suspected the chubby middle-aged guy. He looked like a bad guy from a TV show. Not to judge by looks, but he really seemed sketchy. I thought he was the one who touched me. I even glared at him when I got off, but he just kept staring at his phone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey rewound the footage and watched it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember what the younger guy looked like? Can you describe him?&#34; Zoey asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um,&#34; Ella thought hard. &#34;He looked pretty average, you know, two eyes, a nose, two ears.&#34; She was really trying to recall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she couldn&#39;t come up with anything better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s head was about to explode from Ella&#39;s vague description.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and said, &#34;Wow, good description!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella chuckled, &#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said seriously, &#34;I wasn&#39;t complimenting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey continued, &#34;When he harassed you, do you remember which hand he used?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella hesitated, feeling a bit embarrassed. After a moment, she said, &#34;His hand was near my thigh at first. I thought it was just because of the crowd, so I didn&#39;t say anything. But then he grabbed half of my butt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still felt the shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked, &#34;Left hand or right hand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella sighed, &#34;I really don&#39;t know, Officer Brown. I&#39;ve never dealt with something like this before. I don&#39;t like physical contact with others... I&#39;m pretty insecure and think I&#39;m not good-looking. When this happened, I didn&#39;t even dare to ask for help.&#34;</p>
