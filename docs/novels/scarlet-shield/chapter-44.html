                <p>Charles followed up, &#34;I found Brian&#39;s phone in your supermarket locker, and our tech team also canceled the scheduled emails he was going to send to your family. You shouldn&#39;t have any concerns now. Besides...&#34; He paused and continued, &#34;As a man, what does it matter if you&#39;re exposed? And why would you take the fall for Brian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was something they never understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lawrence wasn&#39;t listening to anything now. Fear flashed in his eyes as he avoided their gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Turn it off; turn it off!&#34; He became increasingly agitated, muttering incessantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To keep Lawrence calm and quiet, Zoey gave Charles a look. Charles understood immediately and quickly turned off the photos on the laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have turned it off,&#34; Charles said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence, breathing heavily with his head down, took a while to lift his eyes and refocus on the two interrogating him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey seized the moment and quickly asked, &#34;So, do you still want to take the fall for Brian? Even though we stopped him from using the evidence he had, are you still planning to take all the blame yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence&#39;s eyes lowered, and he remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles watched him for a few seconds and then continued, &#34;Lawrence, our patience is limited. Don&#39;t keep testing the limits of the police!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence glanced at Charles and then lowered his head again, remaining silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey knew Lawrence wouldn&#39;t talk for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She organized the files on the table and then slammed them down. She snapped, &#34;Lawrence, I gave you a chance, but you didn&#39;t take it. Fine, since you&#39;re not talking, I&#39;ll send these things to your family right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she took out her phone and was about to hit send.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles asked, &#34;This... isn&#39;t quite by the book, is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence was also at a loss. Wasn&#39;t Zoey a police officer? She even had a police badge, but how could Zoey speak with such a reckless ton</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence was a bit panicked. &#34;If you do this, it&#39;s an invasion of my privacy! I&#39;ll sue you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said with an indifferent tone, &#34;Sue me? Fine, you&#39;re not afraid of anything, not even death, so why fear these photos being leaked? Let me tell you, Lawrence, it&#39;s because you&#39;re not cooperating with our investigation. I&#39;m just following protocol by informing your family of your crimes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey continued calmly, &#34;Otherwise, if your family asks me why you committed the crime, what should I say? You tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, what Lawrence was involved in was indeed related to the case. According to the law, family members had the right to know the details of the crime and could attend court hearings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence was so furious that he clenched his fists tightly and pounded the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were filled with murderous intent. Lawrence snarled, &#34;As a police officer, you actually say the same things as Brian! You&#39;re despicable! You disgrace the police! I demand a different interrogator! Right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Lawrence treat Zoey this way, Charles also slammed the table in anger and said, &#34;Lawrence, this is your first warning. Do not insult the police!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish his sentence, Zoey was exasperated by Lawrence&#39;s behaviour and intervened, &#34;Lawrence, do you think you&#39;re the victim here? You think you can choose who interrogates you? Compared to dealing with a ruthless serial killer like you, my actions have been far too courteous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you&#39;re right, I&#39;m despicable. So what?&#34; Zoey wasn&#39;t angry; she looked at him seriously, her eyes full of threat.She said, &#34;Dealing with someone like you requires a different approach than that of a gentleman! So, are you going to talk or not? Just answer this one question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was speechless. It was his first time seeing Zoey&#39;s aggressive interrogation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it was somewhat unorthodox, he found Zoey increasingly impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles initially wanted to persuade Zoey, considering that the entire interrogation was being recorded. It wouldn&#39;t be worth it to let a death row inmate like Lawrence cause any trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to pull Zoey&#39;s sleeve to stop her from speaking further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, a familiar voice interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence&#39;s molars were almost grinding to pieces. He took several deep breaths, trying to appear calm. Then he said, &#34;You go ahead; tell me what you know and what you want to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was puzzled. Really? Did this work? Lawrence was giving in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey glanced at Lawrence with disdain and sat back down. &#34;We know everything we need to know, except for the evidence in your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so confident, as if she was sure Lawrence had evidence of Brian&#39;s murders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s confidence made Lawrence look at her with newfound respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, who seemed like a recent college graduate, spoke so arrogantly. In their few encounters, he had come to admire Zoey. At least, he was afraid of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence said, &#34;Go ahead, as long as what you know matches what I have, I&#39;ll explain everything in detail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence&#39;s attitude was no longer as agitated, and his eyes were much clearer than before. It seemed he had come to terms with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to previous interrogations, Charles saw Lawrence finally showing signs of confessing this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, seeing that Lawrence was convinced, got to the point, &#34;I know you&#39;re quite pitiful; you merely have a fetish for women&#39;s clothing. But Brian, that beast, has something on you. I also know you two aren&#39;t close. It&#39;s only because Brian has evidence against you and you don&#39;t want others to find out that you&#39;re following his orders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;You two worked in the same supermarket, seeing each other every day, hiding such a big secret from your colleagues. That&#39;s why you shared an office with Brian, right? You have a cross-dressing fetish; while Brian is a sexual deviant. Quite the pair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The first time you went out dressed as a woman, you encountered a thug. Instinctively, you dodged his hand with a large movement. When his hand landed on you again, you turned around angrily and realized it was Brian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soon, your nightmare began.&#34; Zoey seemed to recall the scene of their first encounter and laughed before continuing, &#34;Actually, Brian was also startled when he saw it was you. You begged him to delete the photos he took. But you didn&#39;t expect that while you just had a cross-dressing fetish, Brian was a real pervert. Seeing you in women&#39;s clothes, he developed feelings for you. If you didn&#39;t comply, he would tell your family about your fetish. You had no choice but to obey.&#34;</p>
