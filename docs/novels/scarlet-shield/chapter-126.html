                <p>&#34;I really don&#39;t want anything to do with this because I didn&#39;t kill anyone. Seriously, I didn&#39;t. I had no beef with them, so why would I kill them? But I was especially scared someone might&#39;ve seen me with Evan that night. I was worried people would suspect me, so I asked Evan not to tell anyone we were together. He agreed, and we went home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw something that really freaked me out. I couldn&#39;t sleep all night. Later that night, Hugh came back, stinking of booze. He didn&#39;t care about my state and just forced himself on me, saying he had a bad time with some woman outside and needed to feel good with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was already scared, and Haven&#39;s video kept playing in my mind. Seeing Hugh on top of me, I was so fed up with him. Suddenly, an idea popped into my head. I coaxed him into wearing a condom, saying that drinking and getting pregnant would be bad for the baby. He might have some issues in that area because he loves hearing about having kids. He put it on right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I went to Evan&#39;s room and got a syringe. After cleaning it, I extracted the contents from the condom and, while Hugh was asleep, injected the liquid into the bodies. I just wanted Hugh to get caught. That&#39;s why I did it. I didn&#39;t mean to. I just hate this family so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To avoid getting involved, I threw the ropes they used to hang themselves into the river. Evan and I casually placed the chair we used to lower the bodies in front of someone&#39;s house. Most of the chairs in our village looked the same, so no one could tell whose it was. I wanted to throw away the syringe too, but I was afraid Evan would cry and fuss if he couldn&#39;t find his toy, so I kept it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whenever Evan cried, Ava would scold me, so I hid it. I only took it out when Evan asked for it. I just wanted to teach Hugh a lesson. I didn&#39;t think of anything else. Really, you have to believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert and Zoey&#39;s brows were furrowed the whole time. They were both at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey thought this situation was too absurd. &#34;I&#39;m really curious. How did you suddenly think of injecting Hugh&#39;s semen into the three female corpses? Where did you get that idea?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia replied, &#34;I... it just came to me. Wasn&#39;t it a good idea? You arrested Hugh because the semen in the bodies was his.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey and Robert were speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert knew this lead was a dead end. Olivia wasn&#39;t the killer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath. &#34;Alright, at least we know how the semen got into the bodies. You were the first to discover the crime scene, right? No, it should be Evan.&#34; He remembered Evan wasn&#39;t normal and corrected himself. &#34;Never mind, same difference.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Zoey felt a bit frustrated and wanted to curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s actions had led the police investigation further away from the real killer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Olivia, do you know how much your actions have misled and affected our investigation?&#34; Zoey said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia still looked innocently at Zoey. She clearly didn&#39;t care about that and instead asked, &#34;So... will I be executed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was about to explode. &#34;You&#39;ll go to prison!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia, realizing she wouldn&#39;t be executed but would go to prison, immediately brightened up, even smiling with relief. &#34;Does that mean I can leave here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert, seeing how eager she was to leave, felt a bit helpless. &#34;You&#39;re happy about going to prison?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s better than being here. Sir, can I ask, do I have to do housework in prison?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you just need to take care of your own things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I have to do farm work? Like getting up before dawn every day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No farm work, but it&#39;s much easier than that. You&#39;ll also have to attend educational sessions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Educational sessions?&#34; Olivia, who hadn&#39;t been to school, didn&#39;t understand what that meant and was surprised. &#34;I can study in prison?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert didn&#39;t know how to describe Olivia anymore. &#34;Yes, sort of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure this is prison? It sounds like a happy life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He explained further, &#34;Prison will restrict your freedom. Besides eating, attending classes, working, and sleeping, the living conditions aren&#39;t as good as at home. But the most important thing is that having a criminal record will follow you for life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Olivia listened, the happier she got, smiling genuinely. &#34;Sir, I really think this isn&#39;t a prison. For me, it&#39;s a better life. At home, even without handcuffs, I&#39;m not free. Every morning, I&#39;m afraid of waking up late and missing breakfast. No matter how well I cook, Ava scolds me. And after breakfast, I have to work in the fields. At night, when I finally get to rest, Ava nags me about having a son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know a woman can only have one husband and can&#39;t share him. But I don&#39;t care anymore because caring won&#39;t change anything. I don&#39;t regret marrying Hugh because if it wasn&#39;t him, it would be someone else. All women born here have the same fate. At least Hugh didn&#39;t let me starve. I ate better than most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert looked at her, puzzled. &#34;If you don&#39;t regret marrying him, why frame him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because they&#39;re all crazy! No matter how much I give, they won&#39;t be moved. In their world, it&#39;s all about having children to carry on the family name. Just thinking about it drives me mad. I want to kill him!&#34; Olivia&#39;s voice grew louder, contrasting with her usual demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After venting, she calmed down. &#34;But I&#39;m not as heartless as them. Sometimes I regret my cowardice. If I were braver, I would have killed the whole family!&#34;</p>
