                <p>Alexander saw Brian&#39;s intense reaction and decided to remain silent, because asking further would be meaningless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian must have figured out that the police had no evidence, so he wouldn&#39;t say anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, thank you for your cooperation,&#34; Alexander politely said goodbye to Brian and left the interrogation room with Dennis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian&#39;s main strategy was to deny everything unless there was concrete evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the Lawrence that Zoey was interrogating was even more shameless than Brian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what she asked, he admitted to everything, which annoyed Zoey greatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;We found your fingerprints on the body disposal bag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence looked at her without changing his expression. &#34;I did it. I killed them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence&#39;s hands were cuffed, so he couldn&#39;t move much, but he could still touch his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started counting with his fingers one by one. &#34;Lily, Aria, Stella, I killed them all. I was also stalking Ella, and if it weren&#39;t for your appearance, she would have ended up just like the others!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence emphasized the last sentence, giving Zoey a deep look. &#34;I just didn&#39;t expect Ella to be so lucky, meeting someone like you who would follow a victim for days and nights just to catch me.&#34; His words revealed his admiration for Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sneered. &#34;You guys are pretty impressive, managing to find the other victims. But there is no use because they&#39;re still dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s fists clenched tightly at her waist. She really wanted to beat this bastard up!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he admitted quickly, Zoey was still upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the lives of three people, and in the end, he only had to forfeit his own life in return. Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles, noticing Zoey&#39;s state, carefully reminded her, &#34;Let&#39;s continue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey responded and asked according to procedure, &#34;Since you killed them all, describe the process in detail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s there to describe?&#34; Lawrence didn&#39;t take them seriously at all. &#34;If you have evidence, just sentence me to death, why bother with all this? It&#39;s just a matter of following them for a few days, learning their routine. If they&#39;re not suitable, find another one. If they are, go to their house, play for a few days, and then kill them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were chillingly casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey couldn&#39;t stand his indifferent attitude but had to continue the interrogation, &#34;Be more specific! How did you do it, how did you torture the victims, what did you use to kill them, did you strangle them or use tools, and how did you dispose of the bodies? Understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence yawned. &#34;So troublesome; you guys just ask, and I&#39;ll just answer yes or no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it, Zoey felt the urge to beat him up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was because she hadn&#39;t been a detective for long, and this was the first time she encountered such a shameless and difficult bastard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence seemed uncomfortable on the cold bench, shifting his body and looking at Zoey with a provocative and indifferent gaze. &#34;Are you going to ask or not? I have amnesia, so I might forget everything soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held back and said, &#34;Do you have a grudge against these people?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence simply said, &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked, &#34;Then why did you choose them as victims?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence said, &#34;They&#39;re good-looking and easy to control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey held her breath, suppressing her anger. &#34;Continue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence said, &#34;Officer, I am of small stature. If they had boyfriends, no matter how good-looking they were, I couldn&#39;t do anything. If those girls were stronger than me, I might not be able to beat them. So, I chose victims who were thinner, easier to control, and I like tall beauties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked, &#34;How long would you follow a victim before making a move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence said, &#34;I wouldn&#39;t waste too much time following them, at most half a month. When the opportunity arose, I&#39;d drug them, call a cab, and pretend we were a couple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you afraid of being discovered? Why not use your own car?&#34; Zoey continued to ask, &#34;Isn&#39;t that car with the fake license plate yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence looked at Zoey with disdain, as if mocking her. &#34;Come on, officer, who commits a crime using their own car? That car is mine, but I put a fake plate on it. Usually, Brian drives it; I rarely do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was looking for a chance to ask about Brian, but Lawrence brought it up himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked, &#34;So Brian is your accomplice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence denied, &#34;No, he doesn&#39;t know anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was very curious, &#34;Why are you covering for him then? What&#39;s in it for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their relationship couldn&#39;t be that good, because this was a murder charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Lawrence would be sentenced to death whether he admitted Brian was his accomplice or not, they were police officers, and they couldn&#39;t let a murderer go unpunished!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and Brian are very close, right? He hasn&#39;t missed a weekend at your place for nine months straight, and he doesn&#39;t know? Who would believe that?&#34; Charles didn&#39;t believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lawrence remained calm. &#34;Is it so strange that he doesn&#39;t know? When he came over, those victims had already had their vocal cords cut and their kneecaps shattered. Whether they could have a full meal depended on my mood. What could they do? Ask for help? They couldn&#39;t even move, so how could they ask for help?One look from me and they would tremble in fear, so they could do nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now I&#39;m even more curious.&#34; Zoey continued to ask, &#34;With victims in your house, a normal criminal would be afraid of being discovered. Given your reclusive personality, how did you manage to let Brian come over every weekend? Weren&#39;t you afraid of being found out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence said, &#34;He&#39;s my only friend. His parents don&#39;t like him playing video games at home, so he comes to my place to play; what&#39;s wrong with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey laughed coldly, finding his reason amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was also speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey pressed, &#34;So, after playing games, Brian helped you dispose of the bodies, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence snarled, &#34;I told you, it has nothing to do with him! Don&#39;t you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The evidence is right here and covering for him is useless.&#34; Zoey flipped through the records. &#34;Do I need to explain the detailed evidence to you? We know your movements very well. You work Monday to Friday, and you don&#39;t leave your house on weekends. On Fridays, only Brian drives that car with the fake plate past Sun Street, so only he had the opportunity to dispose of the bodies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence was no longer as calm as before, hesitating for a second. &#34;I have superpowers; do you believe that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey and Charles fell silent. Lawrence was being shameless again.</p>
