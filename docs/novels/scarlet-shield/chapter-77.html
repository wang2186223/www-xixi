                <p>She used to be so foolish and stubborn. No matter how hard Paul hit her, he wanted an apology from her, but she just wouldn&#39;t say it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time, it was Paul himself who was afraid he might hit her too hard and kill her so that he would stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this, Lucille kicked him several more times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul was no longer as arrogant as before. Besides his wailing, he didn&#39;t utter another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I never thought you&#39;d have a day like this!&#39; Lucille cursed silently in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered Zoey&#39;s advice, not to hit Paul in just one place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking advantage of Paul&#39;s inability to get up, she kicked him in other areas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each kick was filled with intense hatred, making Paul&#39;s wails even louder. &#34;It hurts so much, Lucille, please let me go, don&#39;t hit me anymore. I won&#39;t hit you again, okay? I&#39;m begging you, it hurts too much, I feel like my dick is going numb, can you help me, I need to go to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she hit his dick, she did use a bit of force. Since she couldn&#39;t hit that area anymore, she switched to his butt. Then Lucille kicked his butt twice more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Paul completely powerless to fight back, she felt great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out that hitting this despicable man Paul felt so good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotionally exhausted from hitting him, Lucille walked over to the water dispenser, got a cup of water, and considered continuing to discuss the divorce with Paul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, before she could drink the water, the doorbell rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul heard the sound and, regardless of whether anyone outside could hear him, shouted with all his might, &#34;Help! Police, save me! She&#39;s going to kill me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille was silent, realizing Paul was truly shameless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced around the coffee table but didn&#39;t find Paul&#39;s phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed that while she was hitting him, he had secretly called the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul was really a coward, calling the police so quickly!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille kicked him twice more before going to open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the door stood two police officers, a man and a woman. The man was John, who had handled their case a while ago, and the woman was someone she didn&#39;t recognize, not Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Williams, it&#39;s you.&#34; Lucille blinked her innocent eyes, pretending to be surprised. &#34;I didn&#39;t call the cop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma glanced at Lucille, then compared the address in her hand with the current address.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke in confusion, &#34;Mr. Williams, is it here? The address shows this place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John naturally recognized Lucille. He thought it was Lucille who called the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the information on the phone showed it was from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of professional consideration, John asked, &#34;Ms. Morgan, your phone number.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille fluently recited her phone number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma looked at the phone number on the report again. &#34;It&#39;s not the same number. Did they give us the wrong information? How could they mess up such important information? I can&#39;t believe it...&#34; Emma&#39;s complaint was interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A male voice came from inside the room, &#34;Help! I&#39;m here! If you don&#39;t save me, I&#39;m going to die. It&#39;s me, the person you need to save is me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The space was not that big, so it was easy for John and Emma not to hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille couldn&#39;t hide it anymore and cooperatively invited them in, &#34;Oh, I just remembered, my husband Paul is here too. Maybe he called.&#34; She said this as calmly and naturally as if she were talking about the weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma, full of confusion, followed her into the room. John was even more puzzled!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had dealt with them before; they were just a young couple who wouldn&#39;t give in to each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John didn&#39;t think much of it, assuming the stubborn couple had fought again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He followed Emma into the room, and when they stopped, they exchanged glances and were silent for several seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They saw Paul, wrapped in a sack, with his legs feebly flailing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me, let me go!&#34; Paul&#39;s voice came out, and he wriggled a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was startled by him and instinctively took a step back. &#34;What the heck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John&#39;s gaze returned to Lucille. &#34;Ms. Morgan, what happened?&#34; The last time he resolved their dispute, it hadn&#39;t come to this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How, in just a few days, did the roles of abuser and victim seem to switch?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After asking, he squatted down to untie the sack from Paul, revealing Paul&#39;s face, who was cursing and gritting his teeth, looking like he wanted to kill Lucille. &#34;Fuck, you bitch! You&#39;ve really grown some guts! Now you dare to use tricks on me! If I hadn&#39;t called the cop, would you have beaten me to death? Huh? Don&#39;t think you&#39;re the only one who can call the cop. This time I won&#39;t reconcile with you, I&#39;ll make sure you go to jail! Just wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille, having been briefed by Zoey in advance, found Paul&#39;s words laughable and not threatening at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul cautiously got up from the ground, his movements stiff and slow, his dick still in pain, making him afraid to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pained expression covered his face, and he hissed, just in time to see John, who had mediated last time. &#34;Yes, it&#39;s you! Last time you locked her up. This time you should lock her up, right? You have to stand up for me, don&#39;t say there&#39;s no evidence or anything! Hurry up and lock her up! Lock her up for a few more days! I absolutely won&#39;t reconcile!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille looked at Paul as if he were a monkey in a circus, wondering how she ever fell for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she crazy before, running so far to marry him, that it was ridiculous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John first noticed Paul&#39;s bloodshot eyes and some other injuries, but none were bleeding and didn&#39;t look too serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me what happened,&#34; He said, signaling Emma to start taking notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma immediately took out a recorder, pressed the record button, and signaled Paul to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing someone standing up for him, Paul immediately changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a completely different person from the one who had been begging Lucille like a clown earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was her! She took advantage of my not paying attention and sprayed something like pepper spray in my eyes. Then, while I couldn&#39;t see, she put a sack over me and started beating and kicking me. The most unforgivable thing is, she kicked my dick hard! My family is counting on me to have kids, if something happens to me, can she take responsibility for that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck!&#34; Emma couldn&#39;t help but compare Lucille to Ruby in her mind upon hearing Lucille&#39;s actions.</p>
