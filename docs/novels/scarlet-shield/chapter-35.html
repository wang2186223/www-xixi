                <p>It was indeed Brian&#39;s car that was found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian glanced at the car in the photo and sneered, &#34;I&#39;ve been following Lawrence for several years now. The salary isn&#39;t that high, but I make about $70,000 to $80,000 a year. Can&#39;t you find out what my living standards are?This junk car doesn&#39;t even catch my eye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis slammed the table angrily. &#34;Answer the questions honestly! Fix your attitude! How many times have I told you? If you don&#39;t cooperate, we&#39;ll charge you with obstructing a police investigation! Do you really think we can&#39;t deal with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time Dennis spoke, Brian&#39;s arrogance would subside for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Brian&#39;s cowardly behavior, Alexander couldn&#39;t help but laugh, saying, &#34;Mr. Scott, I didn&#39;t expect your aggressive personality to be an act?&#34; If he were truly aggressive, he wouldn&#39;t only be aggressive towards seemingly gentle people and women, but be honest in front of Dennis?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;Your acting is a bit poor. Of course, we didn&#39;t bring you here to criticize your acting. We surely have some evidence, otherwise, we wouldn&#39;t be asking you to come forward and confess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian refused to admit it, but the light in his eyes was dimming. He asked, &#34;What do you mean? Are you going to torture me for a confession?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Mr. Scott, how could we possibly torture you? You said you didn&#39;t recognize this car, but we are confused. You said you&#39;ve never seen it, but we found your fingerprints in the car.&#34; Alexander perfectly demonstrated what it meant to smile with hidden intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Brian&#39;s face fall upon hearing this, Alexander remained resolute, still smiling, &#34;So, how do you plan to cooperate with us? Will you persist in your shoddy pretense, or will you earnestly address our questions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold sweat was already forming on Brian&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To cover his nervousness, Brian coughed lightly into his fist and pretended not to care. &#34;Isn&#39;t it normal not to recognize this car? I can&#39;t be expected to remember every single one I&#39;ve ridden in, can I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then pretended to study the photo for a long time before suddenly realizing, &#34;I remember now, this license plate looks like my boss Lawrence&#39;s car. I drove it once to make a delivery. His license plate is easy to remember, so I have some impression of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander watched his awkward acting, knowing he wouldn&#39;t admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had to play along, &#34;May I ask, what kind of delivery requires you to drive his car? It wouldn&#39;t be a body, would it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian&#39;s cold sweat had already reached his chin, and soon his shirt was damp with sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian said, &#34;Don&#39;t accuse me falsely! A delivery is just a delivery; the supermarket even has records!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander asked, &#34;Okay, then tell us, what kind of delivery requires you to go to Lawrence&#39;s place every Friday night and leave his house every weekend night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander asked again, &#34;Every Monday, you drive your own car to work at the supermarket. This car has never been returned to its owner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian nodded. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;You indeed have a good relationship with the owner.He bought a car and doesn&#39;t drive it, letting you drive it all the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what?&#34; Brian was getting anxious, trying to divert the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained calm. &#34;I suspect that you were lying earlier. I have reason to suspect the car&#39;s owner is your relative.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Brian pointed at Alexander, but the next second, Dennis&#39;s gaze scared him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander continued to press, &#34;You haven&#39;t explained my question yet. Are you planning to think of a reason to fool us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing how persistent Alexander was, Brian thought for a moment and quickly put on a fearless attitude, saying, &#34;Fine, since you&#39;re asking why I drive his car at that specific time, I&#39;ll tell you. It&#39;s because my boss insisted I try out his car. He&#39;s the boss, no matter how broken the car is, I have to drive it! I can&#39;t drive it during work, so I can only drive it during my days off. Is it a crime for friends to drive each other&#39;s cars, sir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander asked, &#34;So you admit it? You were the one driving this car for those three days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian said, &#34;Yes, it was me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander looked through the notes in his hand and frowned slightly. &#34;I&#39;m really curious. What do you two men do together for two days every week? And this has been going on for nine months. Do you have some issues with your sexual orientation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian didn&#39;t even think before responding, &#34;It&#39;s all because I&#39;m too kind. Lawrence always told me he had no friends growing up. I feel pity for him, so I thought I&#39;d keep him company on weekends. I hoped to change his introverted personality. After all, he&#39;s the supermarket owner. If his business grows, he can&#39;t always avoid talking to people, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I didn&#39;t expect this.&#34; Brian looked very helpless and angry. &#34;I don&#39;t know what Lawrence did and now I have to be brought to the police station. Damn it, I&#39;m never being a good person again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and Dennis watched Brian&#39;s self-directed performance and exchanged a smile. Clearly, no one believed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Lawrence heard what you said, he would be moved by your kindness.&#34; Alexander chuckled, &#34;But back to the point, did you know this car has fake plates?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fake plates? I didn&#39;t know that. I&#39;ve driven it on the streets so many times, and no traffic cops caught me. What&#39;s going on? Did Lawrence really do something? How is it a fake plate car?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander watched him act quietly and gently summarized, &#34;From what you said, you took Lawrence&#39;s fake plate car at his strong request. To warm his heart and make him a normal person, you would go to his house every Friday after work to bond with him. Moreover, this car is being used by you, but you have no idea what Lawrence typically does. Is that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian said, &#34;Damn, your understanding is spot on; that&#39;s exactly it!&#34;</p>
