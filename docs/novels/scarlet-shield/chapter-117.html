                <p>[I finally remembered when Faye stopped smiling. It was one night when she went to the restroom and came back saying she needed to get a pad for Mr. Lopez&#39;s daughter. It was just a simple errand, but she didn&#39;t come back for a long time... I waited so long that I fell asleep. When I woke up, I saw Faye crying. She handed me her diary and said she didn&#39;t want to write in it anymore because there was nothing happy to record.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[But why did Faye stop writing in her diary? I&#39;m really curious. Even when I write in my diary, Faye doesn&#39;t look at it. What happened? I kept asking her, but she never answered me. She just told me to write whatever I wanted and that the diary was mine now. I agreed and thought about writing everything down, even asking Faye if there was anything she wanted me to record for her. She always said there wasn&#39;t.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Today, I&#39;m really happy because Faye finally opened up to me. She told me that someone liked her and wanted to marry her. I kept asking who it was, but Faye wouldn&#39;t say. I asked if she wanted to marry him, and she said no, she was scared. I was happy because Faye finally let me know what was on her mind. I thought if I could find that man, I could stop him from making Faye unhappy. Faye didn&#39;t want to say it, but I wanted to protect her and speak up for her.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Recently, Faye has been acting strange. I can always tell when she leaves after I fall asleep. She must think I don&#39;t know, but I wake up when she leaves, sometimes because of the sound of the toilet flushing when she comes back. Last night, she tried to leave again, and I held onto her, not wanting her to go. I felt like she wasn&#39;t doing something good when she went out, but I couldn&#39;t explain why.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Faye cried, holding onto me and crying nonstop. I didn&#39;t know why she was crying, but seeing her cry made me want to cry too. We must have been too loud because Mom came in and asked why we were crying in the middle of the night. Faye, still crying, said someone wanted to marry her. Mom laughed and said it was a good thing, that Faye would have to get married someday. Faye cried even harder after hearing that. I spoke up for Faye, saying it made her unhappy, but Mom said I would understand when I was older. I didn&#39;t want to understand; I just wanted Faye to be happy and stay with me. Mom tried to comfort Faye for a long time.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[It was so long that Finn woke up, rubbing his eyes and asking why we were crying while Mom was the only one laughing. I said I didn&#39;t know. Mom kept talking to Faye, asking who wanted to marry her, but Faye wouldn&#39;t say. Mom thought Faye was just shy and said it was okay, that she was her mom and would help her figure it out. Faye, pushed to the edge, cried out, &#39;Does it mean I have to marry Chad?&#39; I didn&#39;t know who Chad was, but Mom said it didn&#39;t matter who she married, that if no one else wanted to marry Faye, she would have to marry Chad when the time came. Faye cried even harder and asked why she had to get married. Mom said women were born to get married and have children.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I don&#39;t get why women have to get married. I remember in school, the teacher never mentioned this. Is it something you learn later? If so, I won&#39;t have the chance to learn it. Mom said girls don&#39;t need to learn much. Actually, I kind of miss school.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Faye cried all night, and in the morning, her eyes were all puffy. I felt so bad for her. I wanted to comfort her but didn&#39;t know what to say. She said she was feeling down and asked me to stay with her. I said I would. She said she wanted to take me to hear a story. I didn&#39;t know what story, or where in the village we could hear one. I kept asking Faye, and she said I would find out soon. What kind of story would it be? I&#39;m so excited.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(The next page was torn out.)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Rilla&#39;s story was so interesting. I wanted to keep asking her to tell me more, but I was afraid she would get annoyed with me, so I didn&#39;t show how much I liked it. Faye pulled me away, but I want to go back tomorrow to hear more.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The diary turned another page.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[It&#39;s so strange. Last night, I went to the restroom, and Faye kept calling me, crying, and waking up Mom and Finn. When I came back, Faye didn&#39;t say anything, just kept asking where I went. I said I went to the restroom, but Faye said I should call her next time. I don&#39;t understand. I can go to the restroom by myself. Why does Faye need to come with me?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[Today, Faye took me to Rilla&#39;s house again. Her stories are even better than the ones on TV. It feels so good. I kind of want to go to the places she talks about, but do they really exist?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[I think they must, because Rilla is a college student. What she says must be true.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[At night, Faye went out again. I wanted to go with her, but she refused, saying it was the last time. Tomorrow, she would take me out to play. I said my diary was almost full, and Faye said she would buy me a prettier one in a few days. I&#39;m so excited.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the last page of the diary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan clenched his teeth in anger. &#34;That Chad is a scumbag! How could he bully two kids like that? It&#39;s clear they were being threatened. Look at this part, it&#39;s obvious. Sadie went to the restroom, and Faye was frantic. Chad must have been trying to hurt Sadie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She tried to get help from her mom, but her mom&#39;s response broke her heart. It was so different from what she expected,&#34; Alexander said, his expression dark. &#34;With her mom&#39;s attitude, if Chad threatened to have sex with her, she would probably marry her off to him without a second thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she&#39;s just an eighteen-year-old kid!&#34; Jordan&#39;s fists tightened. &#34;To suffer such pain before dying, it makes me so angry. I just want to scream!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike their emotional reactions, Zoey was much colder, almost devoid of empathy. &#34;Chad&#39;s already been arrested, hasn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
