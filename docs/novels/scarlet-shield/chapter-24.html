                <p>Back at her dorm, Zoey crashed the moment she hit the bed.</p>

                <p>The women&#39;s dorm was just a hop, skip, and a jump from the criminal investigation department. Plus, they could snag a free breakfast with an employee ID.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey quickly got ready and headed to the police station. She planned to hit the cafeteria but realized she didn&#39;t have an employee ID.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past few days, Robert had been her ticket in, but today she was early and didn&#39;t see anyone she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What now? Her stomach growled. She was starving!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked up at the clear blue sky, and then at the neatly trimmed bushes leading to the cafeteria. Her mood lifted a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought about grabbing some snacks outside, but just as she was about to leave, she spotted a familiar figure-Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, holding a coffee, dressed casually and looked neat and clean. He walked leisurely, eyes glued to his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander glanced up and instantly saw Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re early today,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I got up early,&#34; Zoey replied, surprisingly gentle compared to her usual self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gentleness caught Alexander off guard-usually, she&#39;d either give him a disdainful look or ignore him. What was up today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Alexander was still puzzled by Zoey&#39;s sudden change, she asked, &#34;Had breakfast yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, her eyes were on him without any hint of aggression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander paused but quickly caught on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering Zoey&#39;s sudden friendliness, she probably wanted to eat but couldn&#39;t get into the cafeteria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though both were interns, Alexander was officially affiliated with the police station and had all the necessary credentials, unlike Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I haven&#39;t,&#34; Alexander lied, but he didn&#39;t expose Zoey. He smiled and nodded towards the cafeteria, &#34;Together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Zoey said, looking satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sparkled with a gentle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. Who would&#39;ve thought Zoey would ask for help?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though her way of asking was unique, Alexander figured this was Zoey&#39;s biggest concession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked side by side into the cafeteria. After Alexander swiped his card, they found an empty seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey ordered a ton of food, leaving Alexander stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He instantly regretted sitting with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey ate with gusto, finishing half the food in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander mentally gave her a thumbs up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;By the way, when I was going through the case files this morning, I found...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander raised his hand to stop her, &#34;Let&#39;s talk about the case later; finish your meal first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey rolled her eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, they finished their meal and headed back to the station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had a great night&#39;s sleep and realized that getting enough rest really did wonders for her mind. She felt super alert now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her mind clear, she went over the case files again and found some stuff she missed before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander,&#34; Zoey said, &#34;I looked over the tables we made last night and noticed that Lawrence almost never left his house on weekends for three months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had seen it too, but he had his own take on it. &#34;Lawrence usually avoids people, so it&#39;s not surprising he doesn&#39;t go out to socialize,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked, &#34;Not cleaning his house or taking out the trash for four days straight is normal too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was just impossible. He had to eat at least twice a day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not going out meant he had to cook at home, and the kitchen trash would pile up in a few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forgetting to take out the trash on Monday morning was one thing, but what about Tuesday?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking this way, there had to be something off during this period!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander started recalling the surveillance records he reviewed last night. Lawrence&#39;s trash disposal times were mostly on Wednesdays and Fridays. Thinking it over, he really hadn&#39;t taken out the trash on weekends or Mondays.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if he took out the trash on the previous Thursday, the next chance wouldn&#39;t be until the following Tuesday, leaving a four-day gap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence, who was meticulous about preparing his own meals and loved cleanliness, would find it unbearable if his home was filled with the stench of three days&#39; worth of kitchen trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made sense that there was less trash on workdays. But according to Lawrence&#39;s trash bags, why was there less trash on weekends?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander started to piece it together, &#34;There are no surveillance cameras near the garbage collection station. We only saw him taking out the trash through other cameras, so this is a blind spot. Sometimes, missing some details is normal. But I believe a person&#39;s living habits don&#39;t change easily. The trash generated while staying at home on weekends should be much more than on workdays.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey seriously continued his thought, &#34;Unless... he took out the trash on one of the weekend days, which contradicts his habit of staying home. So, he must have gone out on weekends! He must go out in a way that we couldn&#39;t detect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The underground parking lot!&#34; Alexander&#39;s tone had a hint of excitement, &#34;The only place he could leave without leaving evidence on surveillance is there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve already looked into Lawrence&#39;s background. Even though he&#39;s a supermarket owner, the supermarket isn&#39;t big, and the profits aren&#39;t much. It&#39;s not enough for him to afford a car,&#34; Zoey thought for a moment and continued, &#34;But we can&#39;t rule out the possibility that Lawrence has other ways to make money.&#34; She emphasized, &#34;Stealing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence was very likely stealing someone else&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey and Alexander almost thought of the same thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this, Zoey and Alexander had already entered the police station. Zoey said, &#34;Looks like we have more work today! We need to check all the vehicles that entered and exited on weekends since Lawrence moved in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll let Dennis and Charles know later.&#34;</p>
