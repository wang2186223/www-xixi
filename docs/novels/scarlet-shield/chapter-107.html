                <p>Zoey said helplessly, &#34;Fine, whatever you guys want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a sarcastic laugh. &#34;You&#39;ve done your duty, had two sons. So have Hugh and Evan done their part and had kids for the family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava retorted, &#34;What&#39;s the rush? Men can have kids even when they&#39;re seventy or eighty. But women hit menopause in this age.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, they haven&#39;t yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey deliberately provoked her. &#34;Your son has had three wives and not a single child. Could it be that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava cut her off. &#34;Hugh&#39;s just unlucky! Married three pretty but useless women. The more I think about it, the more it annoys me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey felt like Ava was hiding something and asked, &#34;Olivia can&#39;t have kids either?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give her two more years. If she can&#39;t, Hugh&#39;ll divorce her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert sensed something was off. &#34;Is it possible that the problem is with Hugh...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey interrupted Robert. &#34;Because Hugh&#39;s unlucky, married several women, and still no kids, so you want Evan to hurry up and get married and have kids, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoever has kids, they&#39;re still part of our family. It doesn&#39;t matter who.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey pressed her lips together. &#34;May I ask, do you still keep in touch with Hugh&#39;s two ex-wives?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava&#39;s face was full of irritation. &#34;They&#39;re divorced, why would we keep in touch? They couldn&#39;t have kids, wasted Hugh&#39;s youth for years!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No marriage certificate? What about Olivia?&#34; Robert asked, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These people were not only superstitious but also ignorant of the law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think?&#34; Ava thought she was in the right. &#34;If she had given us a son, we would have gotten the certificate, even if Hugh didn&#39;t want to. Look, she&#39;s been with us for four years! Not a single sign of pregnancy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey despised people who adhered to male chauvinism, and Ava was a prime example.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking having a son was a big deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking her son was the best, and no woman was good enough for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sneered. &#34;Do you know Hugh messes with prostitutes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Prostitutes? Watch your words. Hugh just likes to go to bars and drink. How is that messing with prostitutes?&#34; Ava not only knew but thought it was fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s eyes darkened with resentment, but Ava continued, &#34;Men are like that. Olivia hasn&#39;t gotten pregnant. I hope some woman gets pregnant and gives me a grandson!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t want to hear any more of her trivial life stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She coldly interrupted, &#34;Just answer my question. What were you doing from 11 PM to 3 AM on the 20th?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;11 PM to 3 AM?&#34; Ava was indifferent. &#34;Is that even a question? What do you think I was doing? I was sleeping, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember what time Hugh came home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could I remember? I take care of Evan all day, I&#39;m exhausted. Hugh is so great, he comes home at different times every day. I can&#39;t stay up waiting for him!&#34; Ava connected Zoey&#39;s earlier comment about Hugh messing with prostitutes. She seemed to guess what they were getting at and added, &#34;Hugh often goes to bars. He&#39;s energetic, and women like him. I can&#39;t follow him all the time, can I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert suddenly thought that  Parents&#39; values could really influence their children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava, as a parent, didn&#39;t correct Hugh&#39;s behavior and even saw it as his charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Hugh acted so arrogant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up in such a family, it was hard to develop proper values.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was both angry and frustrated, not at Ava as a mother, but at the backwardness of the village that caused all this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Ava&#39;s smug and proud demeanor in front of him, Robert couldn&#39;t hold back and directly asked, &#34;If Hugh is so charming and excellent, then explain to me why the police found Hugh&#39;s DNA in the bodies of three victims?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Ava&#39;s mind went blank, cutting off all connection to the outside world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of shock, she swallowed. &#34;No way, what do you mean? Slandering Hugh? Hugh has money, he can get any woman he wants!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re the cops, remember that. Before coming to Willowbrook Village, we had never met you or Hugh. We don&#39;t falsely accuse people. We rely on evidence!&#34; Robert explained seriously. &#34;The forensic team used advanced techniques and found Hugh&#39;s DNA in all three bodies!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonsense!&#34; Ava&#39;s furious reaction was just like Hugh&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slammed the table, echoing Hugh&#39;s response. &#34;Hugh has money! He&#39;s a big factory owner! How could he rape them? If this is true, those three sluts must have seduced Hugh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert looked at her coldly. &#34;If you have evidence that they seduced Hugh, I&#39;ll apologize right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava was at a loss. The victims were dead, where could she find evidence?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t care. &#34;Evidence? I can imagine it. They must have seduced Hugh, begging him to sleep with them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Davis! Watch your language! Show some respect for the victims!&#34; Robert said. &#34;We cops work based on evidence. Since you have no evidence, and the victims are dead, we can only consider Hugh a prime suspect for their murder and rape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about? Just because they seduced Hugh, he&#39;s a suspect? Why?&#34; Ava&#39;s unreasonable attitude flared up again. &#34;They must have seduced Hugh, and when he refused, they killed themselves out of anger!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert and Zoey were stunned by her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert couldn&#39;t stand her voice anymore, but to maintain his police image, he tried to appear gentle. &#34;Ms. Davis, should I repeat myself? Forensic tests show the victims were violated after death. There&#39;s no way they seduced Hugh!&#34;</p>
