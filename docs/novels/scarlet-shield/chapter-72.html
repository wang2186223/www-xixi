                <p>The people around her looked at her with even more impatience. Even if they didn&#39;t say anything, their eyes seemed to say, &#34;How annoying! How could you bring a cat to the hospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey sternly warned the cat, &#34;Shut up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never raised these things before, so she mimicked Lucille and reached her hand into the cat carrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kitten cautiously sniffed her hand and then unexpectedly licked her finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately withdrew her hand and took out a tissue she carried with her, wiping her hand vigorously several times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To keep the cat quiet, Zoey had to keep reaching her hand in and out of the carrier, teasing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After several rounds of this, until she didn&#39;t know how many times she had done it, her hand got stuck in the carrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cat stopped meowing, but it hurt so much that she wanted to scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After covering the cat carrier with a white cloth again, she looked at it speechlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of the white cloth, neither the person nor the cat could see each other&#39;s faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Lucille had just finished her check-up and came out, returning to Zoey&#39;s side. &#34;The doctor told me the injury report will take about a week to come out. I definitely won&#39;t go back home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then where can you go?&#34; Zoey asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille thought for a moment. &#34;Probably to my friend&#39;s place.&#34; She said, looking a bit embarrassed at Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious she wanted to trouble her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey could easily see what she meant but still asked, &#34;Why are you looking at me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My friend is allergic to cat hair. She might take me in, but the cat...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t care about others&#39; business. If it weren&#39;t for her duty to accompany Lucille to the hospital for the injury report, she wouldn&#39;t be here late at night. &#34;That&#39;s a shame, then you should stay at a hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Zoey wasn&#39;t taking the hint, Lucille decided to be direct. &#34;Officer Brown, can you take care of the cat for a while? I&#39;ll find a place as soon as possible, and once I do, I&#39;ll take the cat back. You don&#39;t have to worry about cat litter or cat food, I&#39;ll cover all the costs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really can&#39;t help you.&#34; She was currently staying at Robert&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know if Robert and Tenley liked cats, and bringing one home without asking would disrespect the owners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fifty dollars a day!&#34; Lucille&#39;s eyes were determined, intent on making Zoey change her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was silently calculating in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was paying three hundred dollars a month to stay at Robert&#39;s house, and Lucille was offering fifty dollars a day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking care of the cat for a week, although a bit annoying, would cover a month&#39;s rent, making it a good deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey took a barely noticeable deep breath. &#34;Wait a moment, I&#39;ll make a call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered Tenley telling her that when Kelvin was little, she had taken care of a few stray cats. But over the years, those cats gradually passed away. Tenley was very sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she mentioned it to Zoey, there were still tears in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear she considered those stray cats her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The couple probably liked pets but hated the feeling of loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey thought that if Tenley agreed to let the kitten stay for a few days, she would give the money she earned to Tenley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call connected, and Zoey directly stated her request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley&#39;s voice was enthusiastic with a hint of excitement. &#34;Of course! It doesn&#39;t matter how long it stays.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Mrs. Davis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, Zoey told Lucille the result, so the matter was temporarily settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille gratefully held Zoey&#39;s hand. &#34;Thank you so much, Officer Brown. Can you come with me to my house later? The cat supplies are all at home. I&#39;ll help you carry them and take a cab to your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two left the hospital, and Lucille struggled to carry the cat carrier as they walked outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at her visible injuries, thinking about how she had just been abused and her wounds hadn&#39;t healed yet. She said, &#34;Let me carry it. If your wounds tear again, it&#39;ll take longer to heal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Officer Brown.&#34; To lighten Zoey&#39;s load, Lucille took the cat out of the carrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept petting it in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, my baby is so brave,&#34; Lucille said proudly, as if showing off her child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The cat is so small, how brave can it be?&#34; Zoey told her to put the cat back in the carrier. &#34;There are too many people here. Aren&#39;t you afraid someone might scream and scare the cat? If it gets scared, I won&#39;t compensate you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s professionally trained.&#34; Lucille, holding her cat, led Zoey back to her neighborhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille opened the door, revealing a chaotic scene inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything in sight was either broken or lying haphazardly on the floor. The tiles on the floor were also chipped, showing how intense the fight had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, she went to gather the cat&#39;s things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille said, &#34;I knew he wouldn&#39;t come back, but coming back alone still scares me. Officer Brown, having you by my side makes me feel less afraid. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at her back, hearing the sadness in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In such situations, she couldn&#39;t offer comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she asked Tenley lightly, &#34;How long do you plan to keep him locked up this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille turned back with a bitter smile. &#34;I&#39;m actually a bit hesitant. I don&#39;t know how to view our relationship. When he first hit me and got detained, I thought about what would happen if we got divorced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I thought about it and felt that divorce would be a relief. You know, when I was single, I was so happy. After being with him, I felt my happiness decrease. I had to take care of him. I thought these were things a housewife should do, so I endured it. After all, marriage is about living for two people. I could tolerate it. But my tolerance didn&#39;t make him appreciate me; instead, he hit me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really feel like I&#39;m worth less than a free maid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying this, Lucille wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes. &#34;I really wonder what I was thinking, why I wanted to get married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, having encountered many &#39;domestic violence&#39; cases and women who tried to convince themselves, finally met someone who understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille&#39;s words made Zoey willing to say a few more words to her. &#34;It&#39;s nothing, just think of it as accidentally getting trash on you. Now you&#39;re kicking the trash away, isn&#39;t it the same?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille nodded in agreement. &#34;You&#39;re absolutely right, Officer Brown!&#34;</p>
