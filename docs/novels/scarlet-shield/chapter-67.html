                <p>After resolving the dispute, Zoey got off work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille followed closely behind and walked out as well. She saw Zoey&#39;s righteous demeanor, which might have been accentuated by the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t tell if it was Zoey&#39;s inherent aura or something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them walked together towards the subway station. Lucille thought for a moment, then quickly caught up and sincerely thanked her, &#34;Officer Brown, thank you so much for what you did earlier. If you hadn&#39;t recorded the video in advance, I might have come here for nothing today, and who knows what might have happened when I got home tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey thought about Lucille&#39;s hatred towards Paul earlier and wondered if she might be different from other fools.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least, when she mentioned Paul assaulting an officer, Lucille didn&#39;t try to plead for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey paused, turned back, and asked, &#34;Why don&#39;t you divorce him if he hits you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter smile appeared on Lucille&#39;s lips, &#34;I&#39;ve known him since I was eighteen. We dated for six years and just got married a year ago. Now, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my sharpness that provoked him or if he&#39;s been pretending too well these past few years. I find it hard to let go and want to see how he&#39;ll treat me in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey nodded coldly. Compared to other foolish people, Lucille wasn&#39;t too foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reminded her, &#34;Once domestic violence occurs, it&#39;s hard to stop. I hope you wake up early if it happens a second time. Don&#39;t let the past hinder a beautiful future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Officer Brown. I&#39;m definitely not the type to continue suffering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s subway arrived, and she didn&#39;t have time to see if Lucille would continue talking. She got on the subway and said goodbye to Lucille.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just Lucille; in a few days, she would be saying goodbye to this place as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to transfer to a new job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After one transfer, it took less than half an hour to reach Robert&#39;s house by subway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she was now renting this house, she still felt a bit awkward every time she opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she opened the door, Tenley and Robert were sitting on the couch watching TV. Tenley was leaning on Robert&#39;s shoulder, looking like a loving couple. When Tenley saw Zoey return, she immediately got up from the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile was warm and penetrating. &#34;Zoey, you&#39;re back so quickly. I thought it would be another half hour. Wait a moment, I&#39;ll heat up the food! Dinner&#39;s ready!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert turned off the TV and chimed in, &#34;I&#39;ll help you!&#34; He then told Zoey to wash her hands and get ready for dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Zoey returned to the dining table, it was already filled with various dishes, both meat and vegetarian, all meticulously prepared. She could tell at a glance that she hadn&#39;t eaten any of them before. She was worried that her month&#39;s rent wasn&#39;t enough to cover this meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Davis, Officer Davis, did you wait for me to eat?&#34; Zoey said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley replied, &#34;We&#39;re not hungry. Besides, it&#39;s more lively with more people at the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34; Zoey felt a bit embarrassed and continued, &#34;Next time, you don&#39;t have to wait for me. It&#39;s too much trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could it be trouble!&#34; Tenley sat down and took a bag from beside the table, smiling as she handed it to Zoey, &#34;Open it and see if it fits. If not, I&#39;ll exchange it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Zoey took the bag and opened it to find a new pair of pajamas, which were pink that girls would love at first sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding a corner of the pajamas, Zoey felt a pang of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From childhood to adulthood, her biological parents had never bought her a brand-new piece of clothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All her clothes were hand-me-downs from her cousins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lena would tell her that as long as they fit, there was no need to be picky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she would turn around and buy several new outfits for Derek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey felt a moment of sadness. Tenley continued, &#34;How do you like it, Zoey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey replied, &#34;Yes, I like it very much. It&#39;s very cute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley smiled brightly upon hearing Zoey&#39;s approval, &#34;I knew you would like it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey put away the pajamas, and the food was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them sat at the dining table, and the couple chatted while eating, creating a happy atmosphere Zoey had never experienced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make her feel more comfortable and less awkward, they occasionally included her in the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To have something in common with Zoey, they often talked about Kelvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kelvin is such a nerd. It would have been nice to have a daughter,&#34; Tenley said, looking at Zoey with increasing fondness, &#34;I really love kids. If we weren&#39;t an ordinary family, I would have had more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kelvin is good too,&#34; Robert said proudly, &#34;Kelvin skipped two grades in school. We were worried he wouldn&#39;t keep up, but he ended up being the top of his class.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the use of being top of the class? He even becomes a nerd!&#34; Tenley kept teasing Kelvin, while Robert kept defending him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite this, Zoey could feel their love for Kelvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey grew increasingly envious of Kelvin. If only she had grown up in such a family. Tenley and Robert were both well-educated and loved their children, as she had observed during her time with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were upright and morally sound people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to their banter, Zoey&#39;s eating slowed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the dish closest to her, the voices of Robert and Tenley grew fainter, and past memories played in her mind like a movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered it was when she was in middle school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was snowing heavily outside, and she was curled up, using the coffee table as a desk to do her homework.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To finish before Lena started cooking, she had to work quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, the living room lights would be turned off, and Fiona never turned on the lights. She shared a tiny room with Fiona, which had only a wardrobe against the wall and a bed right by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no room to move, let alone a desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes she envied Derek. His room was big, with a large desk and all kinds of toys he liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, she was just envious. Lena had given her an irrefutable reason: since Fiona was still around, she had to share a room with her, while Derek, being a boy, needed his own room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But young Zoey didn&#39;t understand why she and Fiona&#39;s room was so much smaller than Derek&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pat, put your homework aside. You&#39;re so good at studying that even if you don&#39;t do it, the teacher won&#39;t say anything. Come help with the cooking!&#34;</p>
