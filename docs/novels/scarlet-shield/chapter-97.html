                <p>According to the list compiled by Willowbrook Village, they didn&#39;t miss a single household.</p>

                <p>Compared to the collection, they were more curious about the progress of the case. Almost every villager they encountered would ask, &#34;Have you found the killer? Who is the killer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some enthusiastic villagers even wanted to invite them for a meal, but the police declined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In less than an hour, they had checked most of the villagers&#39; homes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They thought the night would go smoothly, but they were interrupted by an uncooperative family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few of them entered a house, just like the previous ones they had visited. This house was noticeably better than the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan couldn&#39;t help but wonder, &#34;Could this be the village chief&#39;s house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was the village chief&#39;s house, it would be a key target for investigation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least it had some connection to Janet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all walked in together, and Zoey knocked on the door. A woman wearing an apron opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t look very old, probably over twenty-five, and she was quite attractive, though a bit shy. Seeing the sudden arrival of several strangers, she seemed a bit uneasy and asked, &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey took out her police badge, &#34;Detectives from the city police department, here to investigate a murder case in Willowbrook Village. We need your cooperation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah? De-detectives? I...&#34; The woman was visibly nervous upon hearing Zoey&#39;s identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes darted around as if seeking approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A male voice quickly came from inside, &#34;What are you dawdling for? Who&#39;s here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, it&#39;s the cop. They said they need our cooperation. Can we let them in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man inside paused for a second and replied, &#34;Let them in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman responded and fully opened the door, revealing a bright courtyard, and invited them in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their house was the most luxuriously decorated in Willowbrook Village. Although it looked like a bungalow, the interior was decorated more like a city apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The large living room and kitchen were connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they entered, they saw a table full of people eating. Seeing strangers who didn&#39;t belong to Willowbrook Village, they all stopped what they were doing and looked over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are cops this young now?&#34; The voice came from the woman&#39;s husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They looked in the direction of the voice. The woman&#39;s husband looked like a nouveau riche, with a big belly stretching his clothes, looking almost pregnant, and his face was shiny with oil, completely mismatched with his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just from the age difference, he could almost be her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man observed them for a moment and finally focused on Zoey, &#34;And there&#39;s a woman. Women can be cops now? Looks like I could become a cop too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, we would definitely support you becoming a cop!&#34; Several slightly younger men across from him echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They completely ignored the police and got more and more excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman beside them kept urging them to lower their voices, and they finally shut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s gaze instinctively fell on the man who was causing a commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t one to insult, but this man looked quite abnormal, as if he had some mental issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan looked at the big-bellied man and asked, &#34;Are you the village chief?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The big-bellied man took a sip of wine, completely disregarding them, acting as if he were the king of the village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the village chief&#39;s eldest son. My name is Hugh Wright. My dad won&#39;t be back until next month. This is my brother, Evan Wright. He&#39;s very handsome, isn&#39;t he? Though not as handsome as me, haha.&#34; He narcissistically praised himself and introduced his mother and wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey really wanted him to take a good look at himself in the mirror!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh&#39;s mother, Talulah Adams, had a typically sharp and mean face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only one who looked kind was Hugh&#39;s wife, who had opened the door for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talulah completely ignored their arrival and continued urging Evan to eat more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ignoring Zoey and the others for a few seconds, she finally asked reluctantly, &#34;It&#39;s late at night, what do you want? Just say it quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander explained their purpose, &#34;We need to collect fingerprints and DNA from all the villagers. Please cooperate, and we&#39;ll leave once we&#39;re done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fingerprints and DNA?&#34; Hugh quickly said, &#34;How can that be? Those are personal privacy. What if you use our privacy to do bad things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re cops. How could we use your fingerprints to do bad things? Besides, we don&#39;t have the ability to use your fingerprints to do bad things.&#34; Alexander patiently explained, &#34;This is to match...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he finished, Zoey interrupted firmly, &#34;It&#39;s for population statistics! Three girls have died in the village. To rule out the possibility of hidden victims and ensure the basic safety of Willowbrook Village, we need to collect basic information from every villager to ensure safety for every household.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan looked around in disbelief, trying to confirm with others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Zoey talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only did Zoey&#39;s colleagues not understand, but the whole family in the village didn&#39;t understand either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Hugh nodded, &#34;Well. You should have said so earlier! My dad told me a long time ago that everyone in the village needs to be collected for safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Talulah also understood, &#34;My husband told me about it, but you guys came too late. Three people are already dead, and you&#39;re just coming now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey gave a fake smile, &#34;Yes, we came late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and gave Alexander and Jordan a look, &#34;What are you standing there for? Get started!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and Jordan quickly reacted and began collecting their fingerprints and DNA.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything went very smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was Talulah&#39;s turn, Jordan asked curiously, &#34;I see you have two excellent sons. They speak more eloquently than other men in the village. Where do they work now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talulah&#39;s confidence instantly soared upon hearing this.</p>
