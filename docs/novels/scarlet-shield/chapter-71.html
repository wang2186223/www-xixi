                <p>He was the only son of the Brown Family. If Derek had injured an important part of his body, they definitely wouldn&#39;t let Zoey go.</p>

                <p>Zoey looked at the harmonious family of four and had a thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since they all hated her so much, why did they let her be born?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they didn&#39;t like her, they could have strangled her. Was it just because of the death penalty for murder?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the very least, they could have abandoned her, and let wild beasts eat her, and it would have been better than now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she was in pain all over, seeing Derek&#39;s miserable state, a smile appeared on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they hit her, all four of them were happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Derek got hurt, all four of them were upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just wanted to make them upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they weren&#39;t busy taking care of Derek, they would probably hit her again if they saw her smile, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone felt that the obedient and quiet Zoey had changed, she became a completely different person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were in such a hurry to check on Derek that they didn&#39;t have time to pay attention to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subtle change started from that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Transferring Zoey from the Riverside Police Department to the City Police Department wasn&#39;t something Robert could decide alone; it required a lot of procedures. So during this time, Zoey was still working at the Riverside Police Department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her daily routine consisted of trivial matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aside from these trivial matters, her days were relatively peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed peacefully, and Zoey thought her days at the Riverside Police Department would continue to be this peaceful. But one late night, she received a phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the unfamiliar number, Zoey initially thought it was a scam call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she answered, a weak, trembling voice slowly spoke. &#34;Officer Brown, are you available now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was the top graduate of the police academy and could determine what was happening on the other end just by someone&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She guessed they might have been fighting and asked, &#34;Lucille, what&#39;s wrong? Did you get beaten again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After asking this, there was a long silence on the other end, lasting about tens of seconds, before a very faint voice answered, &#34;Yes, I, I hit him too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;Are you seriously injured? If it&#39;s serious, listen to me. Take photos of your injuries with your phone, and I&#39;ll call an ambulance for you. You need to get a medical examination immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille responded, &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s your husband, Paul?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey replied, &#34;Bring all your documents. We&#39;ll meet at the hospital. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;m going right away.&#34; Lucille choked up, and they ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey hung up and told John about it. John was busy with Emma at the time and didn&#39;t say much, just reminded her to be safe and avoid physical confrontation with Paul. He was worried she might get hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey agreed and headed to Haven Healthcare Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, it was the city center, and even at night, there were still many people. Family members of patients were accompanying them for walks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some were paying bills for patients, and others were bringing food to patients, where everyone seemed busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her keen eyes, Zoey scanned the crowd and began looking for Lucille.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, she saw Lucille in the waiting area on the second floor. From the side, she looked particularly distracted, nervously clutching her backpack, which was large and bulging with unknown contents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her was a medium-sized suitcase, wrapped in a layer of cloth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are they planning to separate for good?&#34;Zoey asked. Otherwise, there was no need for Lucille to bring all these things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lucille saw Zoey, her vacant eyes seemed to light up, but her eyes were black and blue from being hit, showing how hard Paul had punched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth was also injured, and she had applied a layer of lipstick over the wound, which showed a hint of a weary beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Officer Brown, you got here so quickly. I haven&#39;t even gotten in line yet.&#34; Lucille said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey responded, glancing at her. &#34;Did you bring everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I brought everything you told me to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; Zoey&#39;s gaze fell on the cloth-covered suitcase, and after some hesitation, she asked, &#34;What&#39;s in the suitcase?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s filled with the most important things.&#34; Lucille smiled slightly, without answering directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Zoey a look, signaling her to check for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey lifted the cloth, opened the suitcase, and bent down to see a pair of sapphire blue eyes staring back at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey stood up speechlessly. &#34;Why did you bring a cat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my baby, of course, I have to bring it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the documents?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I brought everything you told me to!&#34; Lucille said as she reached into the cat carrier to pet the fluffy, cute cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille wanted to say more, but the nurse called her number. She responded and handed all her belongings to Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Officer Brown. I&#39;ll be out soon.&#34; Lucille greeted her and followed the nurse inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at the crowded waiting area and sat in Lucille&#39;s previous seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling bored, she took out her phone to pass the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suitcase was left open to let the cat breathe fresh air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little cat seemed as bored as she was, scratching inside the carrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp sound made Zoey very uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put down her phone and lifted the white cloth covering the carrier. &#34;Little one, are you as bored as I am?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cat lazily looked at her. &#34;Meow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Meow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person next to her seemed to dislike cats; they glanced at Zoey with an annoyed look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey covered the carrier again, not wanting to disturb others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the cat seemed to dislike being alone or was scared of the crowd, meowing continuously.</p>
