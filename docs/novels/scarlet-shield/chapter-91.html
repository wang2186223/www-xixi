                <p>Robert always felt that Zoey&#39;s family of origin might not have been very happy, but he couldn&#39;t directly ask about such things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He casually agreed, &#34;They have low cultural exposure. Isn&#39;t that how it is in rural areas? After having a boy, he can be the head of the family, while girls are destined to serve others. Renee might hate Janet so much because she doesn&#39;t want Janet to end up like her, living a miserable life without any say in the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Officer Davis, are you serious?&#34; Dennis and Charles almost spoke in unison, questioning him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did they not see this from Renee&#39;s earlier behavior?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Renee mentioned Janet, it was always bad and impatient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Renee be the kind of mother Robert described?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be too harsh. Even if Janet hadn&#39;t died, imagining themselves in Janet&#39;s life would be suffocating. Janet would want to commit suicide too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least as a parent, I don&#39;t want to assume the worst about other parents. Some people just have different ways of loving their children.&#34; Robert didn&#39;t want to talk about the harm Janet&#39;s family of origin had caused her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and discussed the findings of Janet&#39;s case with the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short break, they all went to the Lynn Family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles stepped forward intending to knock, but seeing the distance between the front and the inner doors, he hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his hand but awkwardly put it down again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he knocked, the people inside definitely wouldn&#39;t hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just shout!&#34; Robert was a bit exasperated with Charles, thinking he was indeed foolish without understanding such a simple thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Charles cleared his throat and shouted towards the gate, &#34;Is anyone there? Open the door!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a woman holding a child came out. The child was very dirty, clearly from spending too much time on the farm with his parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His snot unknowingly slid down to his lips, and he sucked it back up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the woman looked very old, clearly someone who had lived a hard life. Even without doing anything, her face showed her sorrow, which seemed to follow her everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the strangers outside, she spoke before the criminal investigation team could ask, &#34;You must be the new cops.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we&#39;re here for a simple visit to understand some basic information about the victim&#39;s current situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; She spoke softly, without much energy, and stepped back with the child. &#34;Officers, please come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can call me Mr. Davis,&#34; Robert said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sisters&#39; mother, Cinda Thorne, pursed her lips, making her already weary face look even more tired. &#34;Alright, Mr. Davis, come in and have a seat. I&#39;ll get you some water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shook the bottled water in his hand. &#34;No need to trouble yourself; we have water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to entertain us. We&#39;re just here to take some notes. Sorry to bother you,&#34; Robert added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; She carried the little boy to his room and gave him a piece of candy. &#34;Unless Mommy calls you, don&#39;t come out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; The little boy eagerly unwrapped the candy and put it in his mouth, obediently closing the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing no one else in the house, Robert began to examine the layout of the room. &#34;Did you know your two daughters went out the night of the incident?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cinda shook her head. &#34;I really didn&#39;t know. If I had known, I wouldn&#39;t have let them go. As you can see, my son is still young. I sleep with him every night, and the sisters share a room. On the day of the incident, I didn&#39;t hear a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What time did you go to bed that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Usually around nine. After putting the child to sleep, I go to bed too. The sisters might chat for a while. Sometimes they don&#39;t sleep until ten, and I would scold them a bit. After that, they didn&#39;t talk much at night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert added, &#34;Who do they usually hang out with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cinda&#39;s answer was the same as Renee&#39;s. &#34;They like to play with the neighbor&#39;s Janet. They go over every day, but they are very obedient and come back in the evening to help with dinner and take care of their brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, Cinda couldn&#39;t hold back her tears, which streamed down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to be recalling the sisters&#39; appearance when they were alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander immediately took out a tissue and handed it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; As she opened the tissue, its fragrance mixed with the air, reaching the noses of the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My two daughters were always so good. I really don&#39;t know who could be so cruel to kill them! I have no enemies, and I haven&#39;t offended anyone. Willowbrook Village is so small; everyone knows each other.&#34; As she spoke, her tears fell even faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey and the others stood by, unsure how to comfort her in such a situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to Renee, Cinda seemed to have the normal reaction of a mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander kept handing her tissues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They silently watched her cry for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Cinda&#39;s emotions had somewhat stabilized, Robert continued, &#34;Since your family has no conflicts with others, what about the two girls? Did they have any conflicts with anyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were very well-behaved. Everyone in the village knew that. They were so good-natured they wouldn&#39;t even dare argue with anyone. How could they have conflicts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey tried a different approach. &#34;Well, did any boys in the village pursue them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cinda&#39;s sobbing suddenly stopped. She paused, then looked at Zoey excitedly. &#34;Now that you mention it, I remember a few months ago, or maybe last month, Faye told me someone was pursuing her. She didn&#39;t like him and rejected him outright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing a potential lead, Dennis quickly asked, &#34;What was his name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure. I asked who it was, wanting to help her decide, but Sadie was there and said Faye didn&#39;t like him, so I shouldn&#39;t ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when they thought they had a lead, it seemed to vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis, who had been ready to record, gave up and put away his recorder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander asked, &#34;Can we see their room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; Cinda opened their room and let them look around freely.</p>
