                <p>The group chat quickly became lively when Paul took the lead to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Friend A: [So, how about it? Did the method I told you work?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Friend B: [I have told you a long time ago, that women need to be hit sometimes, it makes sense.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Friend C: [Exactly, and we men are different from women. Women are foolish, a few sweet words can make them happy. Unlike us, you just need to apologize sincerely, hit her again next time, and apologize again. She&#39;ll never leave you. Haven&#39;t you seen those TV dramas? There&#39;s a woman who gets beaten every day, and she can&#39;t get used to a day without it, even begging her husband to hit her!]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Friend D: [Haha, are you talking about a porn movie?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone burst into laughter, and the conversation quickly shifted to another topic, which was about adult men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After joking with his friends, Paul thanked them earnestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tidied up a bit, left the internet cafe, grabbed some skewers, and brought some food back for Lucille to show his care for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was also his way of apologizing and trying to make amends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Paul got home, he found that the messy house he left was now spotless; the house looked brand new, even the sofa covers were washed, and the balcony was full of hanging laundry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Paul felt quite touched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you had been like this earlier, we wouldn&#39;t be arguing every day. We&#39;re newlyweds, isn&#39;t it better to be sweet and loving every day?&#34; Paul put the food on the table. &#34;Let&#39;s live a good life from now on. I apologize for this, it&#39;s all my fault. Don&#39;t be mad at me anymore. I&#39;ll try to control my temper in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his words, Lucille really wanted to curse out loud!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering Zoey&#39;s advice, she held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled and sat next to Paul, just looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul didn&#39;t say anything more, lightly coughed, and then went to the kitchen to get her some utensils. &#34;I brought this, especially for you, eat up. Look at me, no matter what I do outside, I always think of you when I eat. You won&#39;t find anyone better than me if you leave. Lucille, you should be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Lucille just wanted to sneer. How did she not notice how disgusting Paul was when they were dating?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on her lips faded a little, but not too noticeably. &#34;Thanks, but I&#39;ve already eaten. Leave it there, I&#39;ll eat it if I get hungry later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul nodded and placed the utensils on the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to sit next to Lucille, but as soon as he sat down, Lucille stood up, not even a second apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul looked at her in surprise. &#34;Didn&#39;t you want to have a good talk with me? What does this mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille&#39;s smile was calm as she looked at him. &#34;Of course, I want to have a good talk. One last question, do you agree to divorce me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul&#39;s excitement turned into anger and impatience because of this question. &#34;You&#39;re still bringing this up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t they already agree on the phone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I called you back just for this! What will it take for you to agree to divorce me?&#34; Lucille&#39;s words were more determined than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul&#39;s face changed instantly, wanting to hit something to vent his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand unconsciously clenched at his waist, gritting his teeth. &#34;Don&#39;t even think about it! Never in this lifetime! Lucille, you want to leave me, dream on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille had already guessed that Paul wouldn&#39;t give in so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille mimicked Zoey&#39;s way of tilting her head, looking provocative. &#34;I insist on getting a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then try it!&#34; Paul&#39;s anger exploded in an instant, and he raised his fist to punch Lucille&#39;s annoying face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This punch landed solidly, leaving no room to dodge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Lucille would have dodged, whether she could or not, but this time she didn&#39;t move, just waiting for Paul&#39;s fist to land solidly on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You need to make the case look like mutual combat, not one-sided abuse. Provoke him to hit you first, make sure he hits first, and take photos to keep evidence.&#39; Zoey&#39;s words echoed in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille glanced at the camera placed on the teddy bear, feeling satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Paul was angry, seeing Lucille smile after being hit made him feel something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He instinctively stopped. &#34;Why are you smiling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; Lucille&#39;s smile deepened. &#34;If you&#39;re so curious, I&#39;ll show you.&#34; She pretended to be mysterious and reached behind the cushion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul curiously leaned in to look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille pulled out a pepper spray from the small box hidden behind the cushion, seized the opportunity, and sprayed it twice in Paul&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul screamed, clutching his eyes and squatting down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes immediately felt a burning sensation, excruciating pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucille, you bitch, what did you spray on me!&#34; Paul&#39;s eyes couldn&#39;t open, and he tried to grab Lucille by feeling, but she dodged easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering Zoey&#39;s words, Lucille sprayed his eyes several more times with the pepper spray to vent her anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul kept clutching his eyes, most of the liquid spraying onto his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The close-range spray was enough to make him suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Paul completely lose his ability to move, Lucille was satisfied and put the pepper spray back in her pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she pulled out a black sack from under the sofa and put it over Paul&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; Paul couldn&#39;t see but felt something covering him. He struggled and shouted, &#34;You must be crazy! Lucille! Wait till I get better, I&#39;ll kill you! Let me go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Paul cursed, the tighter Lucille tied the sack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched Paul wobble like a top, then kicked his dick with almost all her strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accompanied by Paul&#39;s scream, he curled up on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears were about to fall, but he was helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He instinctively curled up to protect his dick, breathing heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t even curse anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he got better, he would definitely kill this crazy woman Lucille!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to Paul&#39;s wails, Lucille felt her mood lighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did he hit her before? She was giving it all back now.</p>
