                <p>Emma remained silent; Zoey was still as annoying as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John glanced at the two of them and smiled subtly, then asked, &#34;Who&#39;s coming with me on patrol tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey immediately sensed trouble and quickly said, &#34;I have an appointment with Officer Davis tonight. I need to wrap up that case over there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John nodded at her response, &#34;Alright, you handle your business.&#34; Then he looked at Emma, &#34;Remember to get ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma hadn&#39;t even said a word yet, and now she was suddenly forced to work overtime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling annoyed, she glared at Zoey resentfully and returned to her workstation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was really lucky, using the case to escape patrol duty. Poor Emma, she wouldn&#39;t be able to get her beauty sleep tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was time to get off work, Zoey left right on time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s gaze was like daggers, sweeping over her constantly! But Zoey pretended not to see it, packed her things, and left the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert had arranged to meet her at the place where he had dropped her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey walked through the crowd and immediately spotted Robert&#39;s private car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was curled up in the driver&#39;s seat, sleeping. In their line of work, they often had to switch between day and night shifts, so they slept whenever they could. It had become a habit for everyone in the criminal investigation department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the car door open, he woke up instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yawning, Robert glanced at Zoey as she got in the car, started the engine, and asked with concern, &#34;How was your day at the police station?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about earning Emma&#39;s money, Zoey felt a bit smug as she answered, &#34;Same as usual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem pretty happy. Is it because our criminal investigation department&#39;s workload is too high, and you feel relaxed when you come back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey knew Robert misunderstood her, but she didn&#39;t explain further and simply replied, &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good. You should know hard work leads to progress!&#34; Robert looked at her seriously, then smiled, clearly teasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Zoey remained expressionless, always giving off a cold vibe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This made Robert feel a bit awkward, but since it was just the two of them in the car, he didn&#39;t mind too much. After all, he genuinely liked Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go, I&#39;ll take you out for some beef tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Zoey loved eating beef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t expect Robert to take her to a restaurant for beef; she thought they were going to his house for Tenley&#39;s cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert took her to a well-known restaurant in the city, and from a distance, they could see Alexander and the others already waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversations often revolved around corpses and case details, which could make other diners uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To speak more freely, they had booked a private room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was thrilled to see Robert bring Zoey along, &#34;Zoey! Officer Davis said you were still working today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Although she had returned from the criminal investigation department, she still had to work at the police station until her day off, which was at least four days away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert and Dennis sat further inside, leaving the seat by the door for Zoey, who sat down next to Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander smiled and said, &#34;We&#39;ve already ordered some dishes. Take a look and see if there&#39;s anything else you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed the menu to Zoey like a gentleman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey took it but didn&#39;t look at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied indifferently, &#34;I&#39;m not picky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone at the table knew about Zoey&#39;s appetite, and the atmosphere became tense for a second. Dennis broke the awkwardness first, &#34;What do you usually do at the police station?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not much, just mediating some civil disputes. The cases aren&#39;t complicated, just a bit time-consuming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander added, &#34;Isn&#39;t that completely unrelated to your expertise? I remember you being quite good at creating disputes.&#34; He smirked and took a sip of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made Zoey dislike him even more. &#34;Yeah, Mr. Williams never takes me on patrols. I just idle around at the police station and leave when it&#39;s time. It&#39;s quite nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This statement drew a lot of &#39;envy&#39; from the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the criminal investigation team, leaving on time was a luxury; they felt lucky if they didn&#39;t have to pull an all-nighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing everyone looking at Zoey with envy, Robert cleared his throat, trying to change the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t just treating everyone to dinner to reward them; he had other plans. &#34;Hasn&#39;t it been half an hour since we ordered? Why hasn&#39;t any dish arrived yet? I&#39;m starving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis went out to check, and within a few minutes, various dishes were brought in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert started eating first, and the others followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was the one enjoying the food the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert watched everyone chatting and laughing, but his eyes were always on Zoey&#39;s every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she seemed about four or five bites away from being full, he casually asked, &#34;Zoey, you&#39;ve been with our team for a while now. How do you find the work environment here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s good.&#34; Except for Alexander who was a bit annoying, the others were tolerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, I also think our team&#39;s atmosphere is great. But we&#39;re a bit short-handed. Sometimes, we men can&#39;t come up with everything, mainly because we lack a meticulous girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying this, Robert stopped eating to show his sincerity, waiting for Zoey&#39;s response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey continued eating, responding casually and perfunctorily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was puzzled. Was he not being clear enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert was getting anxious, but Zoey kept eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis couldn&#39;t stand it anymore, &#34;Zoey, stop eating for a moment. You&#39;re driving Officer Davis crazy!&#34; He glanced at Robert, feeling speechless, &#34;Officer Davis, if you have something to say, just say it directly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Zoey and explained Robert&#39;s intention straightforwardly, &#34;Officer Davis hopes you can join the criminal investigation team. If you agree, he&#39;ll apply to transfer you immediately. How about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s expression remained indifferent, and no one knew what she was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Alexander added, &#34;I think it&#39;s a good idea. Zoey&#39;s personality suits our team better than mediating disputes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles also cautiously observed Zoey&#39;s expression, &#34;Our work isn&#39;t as easy as the police station, and we face brutal criminals every day, with the risk of encountering extremists, it could be life-threatening.&#34;</p>
