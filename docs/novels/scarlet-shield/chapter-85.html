                <p>&#34;Dream it, all you know is playing around.&#34; Robert seriously handed out the files to a few people, &#34;No matter how this case ended up with us, since it&#39;s ours now, we have to go! The bureau has given our team two cars, everyone pauses your work, go home and pack up, and meet at 8 o&#39;clock sharp!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Officer Davis!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey heard that they were going along too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately closed her notebook where she was writing a novel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Officer Davis, let&#39;s go home quickly then!&#34; Zoey said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve already asked Tenley to help you pack your luggage. I still need to get the approval documents and materials. Alexander, can you help me pick them up? I&#39;ll get you a cab.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have everything prepared in advance, I&#39;ll take Zoey over,&#34; Alexander said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey agreed readily, &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll ride with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave her a free ride, saving her money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander made a call home, instructing them on the clothes he needed to bring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After passing through the neighborhood with Zoey, the housekeeper in cleaning clothes respectfully handed over the luggage. &#34;Mr. Edwards, I&#39;ll put it in the trunk for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander responded and opened the trunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper placed the suitcase inside, closed the trunk, started the engine, and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey sat in the passenger seat, glanced around the neighborhood, and saw the name of the community.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of curiosity, she searched it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she saw the price, she marveled at the huge gap between people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person driving her was Alexander, an heir from a wealthy family. She couldn&#39;t help but wish he could experience some hardships in life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander didn&#39;t notice her resentment towards the rich at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander turned his head and smiled at her, &#34;Zoey, you can take a nap. If you don&#39;t want to sleep, you can chat with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t even respond, turned her head,d and lay on the seat, facing away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to chat with a rich person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few people packed some lunch boxes in the detective team&#39;s cafeteria and bought some snacks and water from the nearby supermarket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first detective team set off towards Suncrest City!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert, Zoey, and Alexander were in one car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles and Dennis were in another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took about seven to eight hours to drive from the city bureau to Suncrest City, not counting the rest time, it was a relatively long journey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey couldn&#39;t drive, she just sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others took turns driving, she was the most comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around one in the morning, Robert woke her up, &#34;Eat something, Zoey. It&#39;s been a tough journey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey groggily opened her eyes and found that Robert had already heated up all the lunch boxes. The others had already started eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at the dry rice and dishes, with no appetite at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After glancing around the service area, she asked, &#34;Do they have grilled sausages?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grilled sausages?&#34; Alexander was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert glanced at the supermarket in the service area, there was a machine grilling sausages, and they were rolling on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Zoey wanted to eat, as the team leader, he couldn&#39;t be too stingy, thinking it was a cheap thing anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, you guys go pick, take as many as you want!&#34; With Robert&#39;s permission, Charles was the first to run to the supermarket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everyone finished eating, it was too late, so they slept there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, being a girl, got the spacious back seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert and Alexander made do with one lying on the steering wheel and the other reclining on the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was the most comfortable among them, sleeping until she naturally woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the car window was foggy, and visibility was less than 30 feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yawned, not daring to move too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two in front were sleeping soundly, Zoey didn&#39;t disturb them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out her phone to check the time, it was six in the morning. They had driven for several hours last night, it was time to rest well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she turned off her phone and continued to sleep for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By eight o&#39;clock, it was much brighter outside, and the fog gradually dissipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ate some bread and the car set off again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, they arrived at the bustling downtown area from the service area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we now? How much longer to the destination?&#34; Robert asked from the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander glanced at the map on his phone, &#34;We&#39;ve entered Skylake District, another half hour to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert looked back at Zoey drinking water, &#34;Are you hungry? If you are, let&#39;s find a place to have breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There should be some local specialties here, right? Let me check.&#34; Zoey was particularly proactive when it came to food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out her phone and started searching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After searching for a long time, she found nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;I&#39;ve been here before, there&#39;s nothing special. What do you want to eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Alexander drove to a corner breakfast shop, and they ordered a few sandwiches and started eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really need to suggest to the organization, can&#39;t we take the high-speed train next time? Driving ourselves is exhausting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I don&#39;t want to? But considering Willowbrook Village is too remote, who knows what it&#39;s like once we get there? What if there&#39;s no place to stay? Do we have to wander around? Isn&#39;t that tiring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True.&#34; Dennis stopped expressing his opinion and focused on eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert yawned and told everyone to pack up and continue the journey, &#34;Hurry up, the colleagues at Skylake District police station are waiting for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, finished, Officer Davis!&#34; Dennis packed two more sandwiches for the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey thought it would be very close to Willowbrook Village once they reached Skylake District, just a bit farther from the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the foot of the mountain, she looked at the uphill road, speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? We have to go up the mountain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert asked Alexander to stop and took the driver&#39;s seat himself, &#34;I&#39;ll drive the mountain road, I&#39;m used to it. You go to the passenger seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander responded and switched places with Robert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two cars drove through the rugged mountain road, making their stomachs churn, finally seeing a household.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After driving a bit further, more rural houses appeared in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert parked the car and curiously looked around. &#34;You guys have good eyesight, help me find the city police car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got out and gathered, Charles had the best eyesight, and within seconds he pointed ahead, &#34;I see the city police car!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone looked in the direction he pointed, it was a police car, but no one was inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles said, &#34;Is it possible the car couldn&#39;t go further? They walked up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s possible, let&#39;s ask the villagers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
