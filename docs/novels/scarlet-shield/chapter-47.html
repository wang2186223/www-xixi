                <p>Zoey, having eaten and drunk her fill, tidied up the table a bit and casually said, &#34;Girls who have experienced male gaze often have severe aftereffects. These aftereffects may not necessarily harm their lives, but they will frequently disrupt them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander seemed to know who she was talking about. He asked, &#34;Ella?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Ella is a typical case. Many girls believe their sixth sense is very accurate, and that&#39;s exactly what it is. Ella felt she was being followed and reported it to the police twice, then she successfully saved herself.&#34; If Ella hadn&#39;t persisted, Zoey didn&#39;t dare to imagine what would have happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella, a young girl, might also end up as a corpse infested with maggots in the sewer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;Ella&#39;s actions were the most correct. Unfortunately, most girls with aftereffects in this society think they are overthinking it. Coupled with the false sense of security given by society, with surveillance cameras everywhere, they hesitate and constantly doubt themselves because there&#39;s no evidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander heard Zoey&#39;s concern for her fellow women and smiled at her. &#34;Ella&#39;s greatest happiness in this life was meeting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone else wouldn&#39;t have chosen to keep watch at Ella&#39;s house 24/7.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just happened to be free,&#34; Zoey responded modestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, he saw a different emotion on Zoey&#39;s face. Alexander couldn&#39;t bear to take his eyes off her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you two doing here in the middle of the night instead of sleeping?&#34; A familiar voice sounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both looked towards the voice in unison; it was Robert, Dennis, and Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles said, &#34;It&#39;s almost midnight and the cafeteria is empty. Officer Davis, what should we do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert glanced at Charles, who was grinning foolishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert suggested, &#34;Alright, let&#39;s go for some barbecue then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles and Dennis were over the moon. Charles said, &#34;Officer Davis, you&#39;re the best. Let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander thought of the large amount of food Zoey had just eaten and wanted to refuse, but Zoey quickly agreed, &#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was puzzled, could Zoey still eat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert knew Zoey&#39;s appetite and looked at her in confusion. &#34;I just saw Tony Fisher, and he was praising your appetite. Didn&#39;t you already eat tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was about to lie and say Tony had mistaken her for someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis, afraid Zoey would feel embarrassed, quickly yawned and said, &#34;Oh, I&#39;mbit sleepy. I suddenly want to go to bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too, even if we go now, I don&#39;t think I can eat anything.&#34; Charles yawned, completely ignoring Robert&#39;s feelings. &#34;Officer Davis, let&#39;s eat tomorrow; we&#39;ve been staying up too late these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert said, &#34;Whatever you want, we have a day off tomorrow; you can choose tonight or tomorrow night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow night!&#34; they said in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey knew they didn&#39;t want to leave her behind. On the other hand, they were afraid she would overeat. But she was confident in her appetite. To avoid scaring them, Zoey asked, &#34;See you tomorrow night then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert said, &#34;Alright, it&#39;s decided.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already early morning, and apart from a few lights at the security post, half of the streetlights outside were off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked together towards the police station entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles suddenly spoke, &#34;By the way, Zoey, are you going to the dorm tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;Yes, but I&#39;m switching dorms tonight. I&#39;m planning to pack up and go back to Riverside Police Department. That way, I can sleep in a bit tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going back?&#34; Charles suddenly remembered that Zoey was temporarily assigned to assist them from Riverside Police Department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the case was over, she would definitely return to her original workplace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he had only known Zoey for a week, he felt a twinge of reluctance. It was a strange feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I have to go back.&#34; Zoey didn&#39;t find it surprising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The case was over, and she had to leave. It was destined from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis and Charles looked unhappy, while Robert, having experienced this many times, was relatively calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert said to Zoey, &#34;I&#39;ll drive you back to Riverside Police Department after you pack up as it&#39;s on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Zoey agreed. &#34;Thank you, Officer Davis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly ran towards the dormitory in the criminal investigation department to pack her things, not wanting to keep Robert waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men watched Zoey&#39;s retreating figure, their eyes filled with reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39;s nose tingled with emotion and said, &#34;Zoey&#39;s retreating figure appeared somewhat sorrowful; she must be reluctant to leave us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on! Zoey is probably thrilled to leave you,&#34; Dennis teased him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking back to when Zoey worked on the case with them, Charles hadn&#39;t been much help, but Zoey and Alexander had worked together seamlessly. The two interns had outshone them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert also slowly withdrew his gaze, making a decision in his heart. &#34;Zoey is so outstanding, so she will definitely come to our department in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men discussed Zoey&#39;s excellence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, however, remained much colder than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had seen how cold and unfeeling Zoey could be. She wouldn&#39;t feel reluctant at all when she was about to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey finished packing her things and finally got into Robert&#39;s car with a backpack almost as tall as she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she got in, she saw a family photo in Robert&#39;s car. Her eyes inadvertently fell on it, and the Robert in the photo looked like a different person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One was young and handsome; the other had been worn down by time into a middle-aged man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Zoey could look at Robert&#39;s son and wife, Robert had already started the engine. &#34;You&#39;ve had a busy day. Get some sleep and I&#39;ll wake you when we arrive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Zoey leaned against the car window and fell asleep unknowingly.</p>
