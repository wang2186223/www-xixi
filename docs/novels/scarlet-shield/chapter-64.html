                <p>chapters of her novel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing, she stretched lazily and closed her laptop with satisfaction, only to see Emma had returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma first complained about the smell on her, then said, &#34;Do you remember the Ms. Moore I told you about yesterday, the one who was being abused?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about it?&#34; Zoey wasn&#39;t really interested. But recalling the blood on Emma&#39;s clothes when she returned, she asked, &#34;Did someone die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sort of,&#34; Emma sighed deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Zoey could ask, Emma, more eager than Zoey, fearing she might ask for money if she delayed any longer, continued. &#34;Last night, I was patrolling with Mr. Williams when he got a call from Ms. Moore. She said she was being beaten again and urgently needed us to come over. We had to stop patrolling and go rescue her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When we got there, Ms. Moore wasn&#39;t answering her phone. We searched around the neighborhood entrance but couldn&#39;t find her. Worried something had happened, we called the station for her address.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We rushed over and found Ms. Moore lying on the ground, covered in blood. We were shocked to find she was still breathing and immediately took her to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And guess what? She was pregnant! And her gambling husband beat her so badly she had a miscarriage!&#34; Emma grew more and more furious as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was just angry, without changing anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had already guessed she would continue to be beaten, but the pregnancy was unexpected. &#34;What about her husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even mention that bastard! He didn&#39;t know she was pregnant, and after beating her so badly, he showed no remorse! He even goes to the internet cafe!&#34; Emma grew angrier, while Zoey found it amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she said Ruby brought it on herself, which made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked, &#34;How was the case handled?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That makes me even angrier! She had no money, so Mr. Williams paid for her medical bills. We stayed with her all night, fearing something might happen. The next morning, we even took her daughter to school! I tried to persuade her, but she still wouldn&#39;t mention divorce!&#34; Emma gritted her teeth. &#34;Mr. Williams felt sorry for her and suggested filing a case to detain her husband for a few days. But just as you said, she was afraid a criminal record would affect her child and asked us to talk to her husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My God, I&#39;ve never met someone so stupid in my life!&#34; Emma was almost losing her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was on the edge of madness. &#34;Why? Zoey. How can someone be so ignorant? Beaten to death and still not divorced?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shouting attracted the attention of her colleagues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey glanced at her. &#34;Calm down. I told you so much yesterday, and you still didn&#39;t listen. If you had taken even one thing to heart, you wouldn&#39;t be reacting so strongly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignorance was terrifying, and there would be more cases like this in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Ruby were a bit smarter, she wouldn&#39;t live like a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;m a cop! I can&#39;t just stand by and do nothing!&#34; This statement seemed to form a closed loop with what had happened around Emma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to intervene, but seeing Ruby on the brink of disaster made her want to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t deny her statement. &#34;You&#39;re right, we can&#39;t just stand by, but she&#39;s not dead, is she? And you&#39;ve done what you should. Ruby will continue to be beaten. What you witnessed today is just one instance in her life; there will be countless more. She knows it all but still chooses not to divorce. What can you do as a cop?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you make them divorce? Moreover...&#34; Zoey found Emma&#39;s state amusing. &#34;Is it really worth it? Getting so worked up over someone else&#39;s business? Especially for someone as ignorant as Ruby, you&#39;re wasting your time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma seemed to understand, but also seemed not to fully grasp Zoey&#39;s point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s theory seemed different from what she had learned in police school. Hearing these words from Zoey for the first time, she couldn&#39;t agree or deny them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Zoey&#39;s words were gradually confirmed by reality. It did seem to be the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For instance, in the case of Ruby&#39;s domestic violence, Emma thought she should persuade Ruby to divorce, but after several efforts, Ruby still wouldn&#39;t mention divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she said, the more Ruby showed impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was trying to help Ruby out of her misery, but Ruby didn&#39;t see it that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she couldn&#39;t distinguish between right and wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Zoey was right! Didn&#39;t waste the precious time on someone as ignorant as Ruby!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck it, I&#39;m not getting involved anymore!&#34; Emma said indignantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey saw she finally understood and nodded. &#34;With that time, why not watch a TV show? Why waste it on someone else? If she doesn&#39;t want to leave the abyss, you can&#39;t pull her out. Some people are used to staying in the abyss, and your effort might even annoy them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Zoey&#39;s statements were already very subtle, Emma still understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In short, even if she really helped Ruby get a divorce, Ruby wouldn&#39;t be grateful. She might even hate her in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m definitely not getting involved this time!&#34; Emma made up her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t say anything more, resting on her desk for a while.</p>
