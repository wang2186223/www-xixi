                <p>Talulah said, &#34;You have a good eye for people. Hugh runs a big factory, and there are so many workers. If you ever can&#39;t continue with your police job, remember to find me. I can introduce you to work there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He endured the humiliation and continued to ask, &#34;Hugh is really excellent. That&#39;s something I could never achieve in my lifetime. What about Evan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Evan, the spirited expression on Talulah&#39;s face disappeared without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evan looked foolish to anyone who saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By asking this, he was clearly insulting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After thinking for a moment, she replied, &#34;Of course, he&#39;s helping Hugh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re all very impressive,&#34; Jordan praised as he looked at Talulah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, my sons must be outstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan cheerfully finished collecting the information and left the village chief&#39;s house with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hadn&#39;t walked far when Jordan couldn&#39;t contain his curiosity any longer. He turned and asked, &#34;Zoey, what did you mean by all that you said earlier?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The part about security measures. I didn&#39;t quite understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey suddenly realized and said, &#34;Oh, that was to prevent Hugh and the others from being uncooperative. People like him, whether they&#39;re smart or not, won&#39;t put themselves in a disadvantageous position. Whether they&#39;re the culprits or not, as long as you say it&#39;s to find the culprit&#39;s DNA, they&#39;ll feel inexplicably guilty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan blinked, not sure if he understood, &#34;Oh, I think I&#39;ve encountered people like that before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But didn&#39;t the villagers say that the village chief&#39;s son Evan had a thing for Janet?&#34; Alexander said, &#34;We just brought up the case in front of them, and they didn&#39;t ask a single question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan said, &#34;I think it&#39;s normal. Didn&#39;t the information you gathered say it was Renee&#39;s one-sided affection? The two of them had no feelings for each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey added, &#34;But Evan is a fool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Alexander and Jordan fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan instinctively looked around and, seeing that there was almost no one on the road at this time, finally felt relieved. &#34;He may not seem smart, but you shouldn&#39;t say such things in public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Zoey asked, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan explained, &#34;You guys are from the big city and don&#39;t know how backward this small place is. Take Willowbrook Village, for example. They may seem cooperative with us now, but if we offend any of their people, they&#39;ll unite to drive us away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others were puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan continued, &#34;Remember those cases of women and children being trafficked? Our chief had to personally come to take them away. Otherwise, the villagers would have thrown stones at our car, refusing to let us take them. You should be careful with your words. If these people go crazy, even police warnings won&#39;t work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey roughly understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The barren mountains and harsh environment easily breed difficult and uncooperative people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander thought of the women they had met earlier who seemed very fearful when mentioning the village chief&#39;s house. It must be for this reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t want to reveal the village&#39;s secrets to outsiders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offending the village chief would make it impossible for them to stay here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Combining this with what Jordan said, everything made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander and Zoey instinctively exchanged glances, and then Jordan seriously continued, &#34;My hometown also has people like Evan. They weren&#39;t born with brain problems; it was a fever that damaged their brains later on. Evan is probably the latter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked, &#34;Could someone like Evan commit murder?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan replied, &#34;I&#39;m not sure. I can&#39;t say for certain, but their minds are chaotic. They don&#39;t have the concept of killing someone, but they can kill.&#34; If the victim kept provoking him, he might do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The case seemed to be paused by an invisible hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them finished collecting the information, which took over an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then they successfully reunited with Dennis and Robert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They organized the collected information and handed it over to the technical staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, they returned to their car to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had been busy from morning till night without eating anything. She didn&#39;t feel it while working, but once she stopped, her stomach hurt badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat in the back, frantically searching for something to eat in the car, not caring if it was expired, and stuffed it into her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Zoey&#39;s pitiful state, Robert felt a bit sorry for her and said, &#34;Why don&#39;t we go down the mountain, find a place to eat, and then find a place to stay? We can come back tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Robert had spoken, everyone immediately nodded without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his team members like this, Robert had no choice but to shake his head and smile helplessly in the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was too dark now, and they were on the mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Robert drove very slowly down the mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they drove away from Willowbrook Village, there were no more houses, only forests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accompanied by the howling wind, the trees in the forest swayed continuously. It was particularly terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This place is perfect for shooting a horror movie,&#34; Robert said. Zoey leaned back in her seat, resting with her eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert&#39;s description formed a movie scene in her mind, and she said, &#34;In horror movies, a ghost usually appears halfway, jumps onto our car, and reaches out with bloody hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert and Alexander fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zoey is really good at telling stories.&#34; Robert didn&#39;t believe in such things, but at that moment, he felt a bit scared by Zoey&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fear hadn&#39;t dissipated when his phone vibrated in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s calling?&#34; Robert focused on the road ahead and asked Alexander to help him take out the phone. &#34;Check who&#39;s calling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Alexander took the phone out of his pocket, seeing it was a long string of internet numbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Robert&#39;s instructions, he answered the call, and a sales pitch came through. &#34;It&#39;s a sales call, Officer Davis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert responded, &#34;Hang up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sales call conveniently interrupted Zoey&#39;s story. Robert drove for a while longer before spotting some lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car transitioned from the mountain road to the city streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unprecedented sense of security enveloped them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert checked the time. It was just 8:30 PM, not too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were still many restaurants open in the town. Robert parked the car in front of a relatively large-looking restaurant. &#34;How about this one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
