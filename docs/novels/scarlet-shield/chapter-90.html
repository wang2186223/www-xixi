                <p>&#34;How would I know? They only met once during the blind dating. They haven&#39;t had any other contact.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Living in the same village, how could they have only met during the blind dating ?&#34; Zoey pressed on, not letting her off the hook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee was already very impatient but had to brush them off. &#34;They met when they were kids, but then they went to school. The village chief&#39;s son grew up in the county, so he didn&#39;t see Janet again. Now that he&#39;s grown up and returned, they met again for blind dating. What&#39;s wrong with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at her coldly, &#34;We have interviewed other villagers, and they told us that Janet didn&#39;t want to get married. She plans to go out to work next month. Did she mention this to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Renee&#39;s mocking smile almost overflowed, &#34;Janet, an illiterate girl, wants to go out and earn money? How much can she earn? I think she just wants to go out and be taken advantage of by city folks. She might as well get married early and be a proper woman, taking care of her husband and children at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey mocked, &#34;Like an idiot like you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee was puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee, was a woman who had been living in the countryside for years. How could she be intimidated by a young girl like Zoey?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee&#39;s shrewish demeanor instantly surfaced, &#34;You little girl, you really have a sharp tongue. Did your mother teach you to talk like this to your elders? A child like you must have a bad mother. Seeing you, I can almost imagine what your mother is like!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Keep cursing.&#34; Zoey said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee fell silent, thinking Zoey was crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s words were more effective than a hundred retorts, which stunned Renee directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at her calmly and said, &#34;I don&#39;t mind at all if an idiot like you curses another idiot in front of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she felt satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee, who made her unhappy, also cursed someone who made her equally unhappy. Why wouldn&#39;t she enjoy such a good thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other members of the criminal investigation team didn&#39;t understand what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They thought Renee was about to face a more violent retaliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Zoey didn&#39;t say anything next, with a slight smile on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not afraid of anything, are you? Hmm? You&#39;re quite something. Today, I&#39;ll make you regret doing it!&#34; Renee stepped forward, unable to control herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander saw that they were about to fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of Brian&#39;s mother&#39;s incident, he quickly stepped in front of Zoey, trying to calm the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled and explained the misunderstanding, &#34;Mrs. Fuller, we&#39;re here to ask about Janet&#39;s whereabouts, nothing else. You might have misunderstood her words. She didn&#39;t mean it that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right!&#34; Robert also helped change the topic, &#34;The night before last, the day of the incident, did Janet show any unusual behavior? Also, what time does she usually go to bed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee knew they were all in this together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the men protecting Zoey, she couldn&#39;t find any opportunity to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee glared at Zoey behind Alexander and replied angrily, &#34;In the countryside, we go to bed around nine after finishing work. I&#39;m usually too busy to care about her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert added, &#34;Before this, did Janet ever go out in the middle of the night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee replied, &#34;I don&#39;t know. I sleep too deeply every night, from night till morning. Even if she went out, I wouldn&#39;t know. She might have gone out to mess with the men and got herself killed. When she suddenly told me she wanted to go out to work, I knew she wasn&#39;t a good person! She deserved to die. If she hadn&#39;t died, the Fuller Family&#39;s dignity would have been ruined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee&#39;s response was simply shocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They couldn&#39;t understand why working would be equated with going out to fool around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet was clearly Renee&#39;s daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could a mother use such despicable words to describe her daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert asked some other questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee&#39;s answers were almost always the same, either &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; or cursing Janet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee complained that Janet was inefficient at work, and cursed her for dreaming of going out to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cursed her for not contributing anything to the Fuller Family and dying after they raised her for so many years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert and the other members of the criminal investigation team couldn&#39;t listen any longer, each with deeply furrowed brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert raised his hand to stop Renee&#39;s continued cursing and asked, &#34;Can we take a look at Janet&#39;s room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead, it&#39;s the first room on the left.&#34; After Renee finished speaking, she pointed it out to everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group went in and found that Janet shared a large rural bed with Renee, a large rural bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the bed was an old wooden box filled with clothes, looking very worn out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were traces of insects gnawing everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the wooden box was a cheap makeup cream used by Renee and Janet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the wooden box were a few patched-up clothes, and nothing else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the clothes were Renee&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Janet had very few clothes, and the few she had were altered from Renee&#39;s clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving Janet&#39;s house, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee was the epitome of victim-blaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee&#39;s shallow thinking led her to believe that Janet must have done something wrong to get herself killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, rural people have simple minds, and their families had no known enemies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would be so insane as to rape and kill, and then leave the victim&#39;s pants half off, even in death, to humiliate the victim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renee even told them, &#34;I don&#39;t think you can find out anything. You might as well send Janet&#39;s body back early so I can hold a funeral and see if I can get some money. I don&#39;t want to have raised her for nothing! My son will be back soon, and we need money for many things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t rural people supposed to be simple and honest? Why do I see a different side in Renee?&#34; Dennis complained, &#34;She is worse than a beast! Even animals know to protect their young. I often watch nature shows, and mother deer will slow down to let lions and tigers chase them to protect their fawns. Isn&#39;t that what motherly love should be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least, in Dennis&#39;s understanding, it was a bit terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey calmly opened a bottle of water and took a sip, &#34;Isn&#39;t this normal? There are plenty of people like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed used to it, even though she was the youngest in the criminal investigation team, she acted more mature than the others.</p>
