                <p>Robert felt the conversation was veering off track, so he cleared his throat and continued, &#34;Tell me about you and Hugh. When did you two get married?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been about four years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Four years? You&#39;re only 22 now, so you got married right when you turned 18?&#34; Robert could hardly believe it. If it were his daughter in front of him, he couldn&#39;t imagine how he&#39;d react. He&#39;d probably lose his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eighteen was such a wonderful age, meant to be spent in school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the beginning of youth, and it just... got buried?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert asked, &#34;Why did you marry Hugh? Did he pursue you, or was it your choice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This marriage was arranged by my parents... In our village, marriages are decided by the parents.&#34; Olivia sighed repeatedly, her voice filled with helplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t know how to respond. To her, this was just absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was no way around it; they were disconnected from modern society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up in such a village, and being educated by such a culture, it was ingrained in their souls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t save them with just a few words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she couldn&#39;t judge Olivia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia added, &#34;My parents told me Hugh liked me, said I was very gentle and would make a good wife. They were one of the better-off families in the village... I thought it didn&#39;t matter who I married, life would be the same, so I agreed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked, &#34;If you had disagreed, would they have forced you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have feelings for Hugh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia&#39;s voice was slow and uncertain, &#34;I, I don&#39;t know. Maybe, maybe a little. We&#39;ve been together for so long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert silently wrote down his thoughts: &#34;No feelings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey added, &#34;How does he treat you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s okay, doesn&#39;t let me go hungry, and always brings money home. You saw Hugh&#39;s father is old, and Evan is... not right in the head. Hugh supports the whole family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mean just giving you money and food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia still didn&#39;t understand, &#34;What do you mean then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert and Zoey exchanged a look, both coming to the same conclusion: these two had no real feelings for each other, just two people living together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert asked, &#34;Where were you the night before last, on the 20th?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia didn&#39;t hesitate, &#34;At home, cooking and cleaning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you go to bed around eleven?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia replied, &#34;Yes, we usually go to bed around nine or ten.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you remember when Hugh came home that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That night...&#34; Olivia seemed to be thinking hard, &#34;I think he wasn&#39;t home when I fell asleep, but he was there when I woke up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t notice him coming home at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... I wake up very early and work hard all day, so I sleep very deeply.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert nodded and made a note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia asked, confused, &#34;Officer, why are you asking me this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert looked at the frail Olivia and decided not to beat around the bush, &#34;You must have heard about the three girls who were killed in Willowbrook Village recently, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such a big thing, of course I know,&#34; Olivia answered, then seemed to realize something, her tone changing, &#34;Officer... do you mean Hugh is involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert said, &#34;Yeah. That&#39;s why we brought your whole family in this morning. Hugh is a key suspect in this case. We found his DNA on all three victims, so we need your full cooperation in our investigation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia, despite being from a rural area, was first shocked by the news about Hugh, then started crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert didn&#39;t understand why she was crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their marriage wasn&#39;t good to begin with, so why cry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Zoey, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey took out a pack of tissues and handed it to Olivia, &#34;Alright, stop crying. We don&#39;t have much time to waste here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert wanted Zoey to comfort her, not expecting she would do that coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia took the tissues, wiped her tears, and after a few minutes, finally stopped crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert tried to shift her focus, &#34;Ms. Smith, do you know the three victims?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we&#39;re about the same age, and we&#39;d greet each other when we met,&#34; Olivia replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How was Hugh&#39;s relationship with them? Did he know them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. He works late every day and doesn&#39;t interact much with the villagers... He probably didn&#39;t know them, so I don&#39;t understand why he would...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does Hugh have any other women outside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia said, &#34;I don&#39;t know. He doesn&#39;t let me check his phone. Officer Brown, do you think he...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m just asking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia responded softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have another question,&#34; Zoey asked directly, &#34;Do women in your village marry very young, and men marry late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Both men and women marry young,&#34; Olivia said, her tearful eyes lifting slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did Hugh marry you so late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was married before,&#34; Olivia said, &#34;He got married in his twenties, divorced in his thirties, married again, and then married me when he was almost forty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert exclaimed, &#34;What!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh didn&#39;t look like much, how did he manage to marry so many times?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was shocked, &#34;Hugh always wants his wife to be in her twenties? Does he just replace them when they get older?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. He was already divorced when he married me, I don&#39;t know what happened with his exes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does Hugh have any children?&#34; Zoey asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Children? I haven&#39;t seen any...&#34; Olivia looked genuinely confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert felt both anger and pity for her, &#34;Your parents are really something, marrying you off without knowing what kind of person Hugh is? At least they should have found out why he divorced his previous wives! Isn&#39;t that what parents are supposed to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert&#39;s words weren&#39;t meant to blame her, but he was furious at her parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Olivia realize she was treated like a commodity by her parents?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t care who their daughter married, just took the money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he spoke too harshly, because Olivia started crying again, &#34;Officer, I really didn&#39;t know. My parents told me he would cherish a wife more because he had been married twice. I believed my parents wouldn&#39;t lie to me, so I married him.&#34;</p>
