                <p>If she doesn&#39;t get a divorce, she&#39;ll feel uncomfortable everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the future, her work will definitely be distracted because of this matter. This marriage must end!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey glanced around and lowered her voice, saying, &#34;The reason Paul doesn&#39;t want to divorce you is very simple. He&#39;s almost thirty and this is his second marriage. You two don&#39;t have any children, and if he divorces you, it&#39;s unlikely he&#39;ll find a young girl to marry. Of course, there are some young girls as naive as you, but the chances are very low, almost nonexistent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused and continued, &#34;If Paul looks for another marriage, it will definitely be with a woman who has also been divorced. If he&#39;s lucky, she won&#39;t have children, and they might be able to have a child together in the future. If he&#39;s unlucky and she has children, even if they have a child together, his wife and her ex-husband won&#39;t be able to cut ties because of the child.&#34; All these reasons were due to selfishness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men were more rational than women, so they would always think in different directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, do you think if you were Paul, would you divorce yourself?&#34; Zoey asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille thought about it, and everything Zoey said made sense. If she were in Paul&#39;s shoes, she might not want a divorce either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, from Paul&#39;s perspective, he didn&#39;t gain any advantage by marrying her. If they divorced, unless she agreed to give up the property, he wouldn&#39;t let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wasn&#39;t willing to give up the property.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them were entangled in this matter, making each other sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what should I do? Is there no hope for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course there is,&#34; Zoey said confidently. &#34;It&#39;s simple, really. You just haven&#39;t hit him hard enough!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille didn&#39;t understand what she meant and asked, &#34;Can you explain it more clearly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s simple. Think about why you feel you&#39;re being domestically abused,&#34; Zoey continued to explain. &#34;Because you think the contact with Paul is heavy, he hit you first, and you were more seriously injured than him, so you feel it&#39;s domestic abuse, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right. My strength is so much less than his, my punches don&#39;t hurt him at all!&#34; Lucille said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey added, &#34;But the law doesn&#39;t consider strength. Any of its provisions, at least when viewed in isolation, are completely fair. In other words, it only considers gender equality and doesn&#39;t make special provisions for the strength differences between men and women.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She guessed that Lucille might still not understand and added a few more sentences. &#34;Let me put it simply. Suppose you are the one committing domestic abuse, constantly inflicting violence on Paul. But because of the strength difference between men and women, you hit him many times, but it might not be as serious as him hitting you once. And he hit you in self-defense. In this case, would the judge rule that you are committing domestic abuse? Do you think that&#39;s reasonable? Do you accept that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille was silent, feeling extremely confused about so many questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tentatively replied, &#34;Reasonable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From a moral standpoint, it is reasonable, but from a physiological standpoint, you are more seriously injured. Does that count as excessive self-defense?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille was getting more and more confused by Zoey&#39;s words, feeling that no matter what she did, it didn&#39;t seem right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Officer Brown, what should I do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was getting frustrated, &#34;Didn&#39;t I just say? In your current marital relationship, even if there is mutual violence, the harm Paul suffers is far less important than his desire to vent his violence. He feels that as long as he can hit you and feel satisfied, your punches are insignificant to him. So you just need to make him suffer more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille understood this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was telling her to fight violence with violence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her strength was limited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how she thought about it, Paul had the advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t beat Paul!&#34; If she could beat Paul, would she need to call the police and ask for their help?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey took a deep breath, her tone showing a bit of disdain for Lucille&#39;s stupidity. &#34;Strength can&#39;t be changed, but can&#39;t you think of other ways?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For example?&#34; Lucille asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey tried to calm herself down, and after calming down, she said, &#34;Come over when you pick up the cat, and I&#39;ll teach you face-to-face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul had nowhere to go, so he was playing games at an internet cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed up all night and was now sleeping at his spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille&#39;s call vibrated against his waist, and Paul groggily took out his phone without seeing who was calling and answered, &#34;Hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence on the other end for a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul looked at his phone and saw it was Lucille calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought she was going to talk about the divorce again, so before Lucille could speak, he said directly, &#34;If this is about the divorce, you can hang up now. Lucille, as long as I&#39;m alive, I will never divorce you! If you have the guts, go ahead and sue or call the cop. If not, just endure it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul expected Lucille to shout back at him, as she always did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was ready to retaliate against Lucille.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, Lucille didn&#39;t shout. Instead, she calmly said, &#34;I&#39;m not calling about the divorce. I just want to have a good talk with you. We&#39;ve been together for so long, from dating to marriage, it hasn&#39;t been easy.&#34; She sighed after saying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul heard Lucille&#39;s softening tone and thought she had finally given in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had asked a few married friends about this, and they all told him that women just need to be coaxed. After all, marriage was an important matter, and both marriage and divorce were not that simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His friends had told him many bad things about women getting divorced, which made Paul more confident when he heard Lucille&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this, his tone became gentler, &#34;Lucille, why didn&#39;t you do this earlier? Let&#39;s give each other a chance. After all, I love you very much. Every couple argues, right? You know how I treated you when we were dating. If I didn&#39;t love you, I wouldn&#39;t have married you. Hearing you say this makes me really happy. Lucille, I love you very much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille didn&#39;t want to hear his pretentious words anymore. It was always the same lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille felt disgusted, &#34;Okay, come back early. Be home by eight tonight, I&#39;ll be waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul hung up, satisfied, &#34;I&#39;ll be back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he hung up, he took a screenshot of the call log and posted it in the group chat: [Look, Lucille called me first. You guys were right, women are just like that. If you hit them a bit, they become very obedient. You should have heard how gentle her tone was when she talked to me.]</p>
