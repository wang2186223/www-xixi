                <p>&#34;It&#39;s really okay.&#34; Jordan curiously looked at Zoey, &#34;But, Zoey, how did you figure out I was a girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said expressionlessly, &#34;Because I accidentally saw you changing your sanitary pad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was how it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s answer made Jordan a bit shy, &#34;Zoey, you observe very carefully.&#34;</p>

                <p>Since there was no elevator in this small town, they had to climb the stairs together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was talking about the deceased Faye and Sadie&#39;s names, and suddenly they started talking about their own names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their names weren&#39;t particularly special, and after everyone had spoken, it was Zoey&#39;s turn to explain the meaning of her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained indifferent, as if she had no interest in anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remembered that she had mentioned growing up in a family that favored males over females and kindly tried to help her out, &#34;I think the name Zoey is quite nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert also agreed, &#34;I think Zoey&#39;s name sounds nice too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was silent for a few seconds and then responded lightly, &#34;I chose my name with my teacher in middle school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With your middle school teacher?&#34; Everyone stopped in confusion and looked at Zoey, waiting for her next sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey and Jordan were walking at the back. She originally didn&#39;t want to bring this up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that they all wanted to know the reason, she said indifferently, &#34;My original name was Pat. I didn&#39;t like that name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was also stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had known each other for years, and Zoey had never mentioned this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But when I turned 18, I changed my name,&#34; Zoey added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert could almost see from Zoey&#39;s description of her tragic childhood and said sympathetically, &#34;You changed it to Zoey? Zoey is a very nice name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan, standing beside, said, &#34;Zoey, when you changed your name, didn&#39;t your parents hit you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They did, so what? I didn&#39;t die.&#34; Zoey replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles curiously asked, &#34;Why did you change it to Zoey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because my teacher told me that if I changed my name, he would take care of my meals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert couldn&#39;t help but praise, &#34;What a good teacher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, very good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t understand. Was this the reason Zoey gave herself? Why would changing her name mean she could get meals from her teacher?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled the days spent with Zoey, and how she ate, completely unlike the image of a typical girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that because her family favored males over females, they didn&#39;t give her food?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t dare to think further, hoping it wasn&#39;t the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one asked any more questions, afraid of touching on Zoey&#39;s sad topics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They then each went back to their rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey and Jordan entered the same room, took turns washing their faces, and lay down on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They started chatting, and Jordan said first, &#34;Although my family also favored males over females, luckily they didn&#39;t have a third child. Otherwise, my sister and I might have had a harder time. I have a deep understanding of this. If you don&#39;t have money, don&#39;t have children. That&#39;s my plan for the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s pretty good,&#34; Zoey replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan asked her, &#34;How many children are in your family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not bad. Most families can afford two children. They should have bought you similar things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;They usually prioritize the boy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True. How&#39;s your relationship with your brother? I get along well with my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;Terrible. I wish he were dead, and he wishes I were dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you must have had a hard time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was hard, but I made it harder for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jordan asked, &#34;How did you do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By hitting him, cursing him, and insulting him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t your parents be angry? They already preferred the son. If you misbehave, wouldn&#39;t they dislike you even more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter.&#34; After all, she didn&#39;t like those people who couldn&#39;t even be called her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they chatted, they fell asleep without realizing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, everyone woke up early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villagers of Willowbrook Village had to go to the fields at five or six in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To not delay their progress or their own, Robert had sent a message to the technical department the night before, asking them to send the test report first thing in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With everyone in the village, if a murderer was hiding among them, they could catch them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Robert woke up, the test report was sent over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately shared it in their criminal investigation team&#39;s group chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, used to waking up at the slightest movement in the dormitory, heard her phone vibrate and slowly opened her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yawning, she picked up her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The test report appeared before her eyes, and she eagerly clicked on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Skipping the professional jargon, she quickly scrolled down to the important conclusion: Numerous fingerprints were found on the three bodies, both male and female, too mixed to serve as direct evidence. The key was the semen test results found in their bodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Semen sample A found only in Faye matched a man named Chad Lopez.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Semen sample B found in all three victims matched Hugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had no impression of Chad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could remember almost everyone she had interacted with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chad&#39;s sample should have been collected by Charles and Dennis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she remembered Hugh vividly. The face that made her nauseous just thinking about it almost made Zoey retch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having gotten the results, she nudged Jordan beside her, &#34;Wake up, Jordan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nudged Jordan several times before Jordan groggily opened her eyes, &#34;What time is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just past four.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So early.&#34; Hearing the time, Jordan closed her eyes again, &#34;I&#39;ll get up later...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The test results are out. We need to catch the murderer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Catching the murderer?&#34; Hearing this, Jordan instantly became alert, &#34;Who is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked while getting dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was on the phone, &#34;Wait a minute, let me call Officer Davis first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 4:10 AM, the criminal investigation team gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t have time for breakfast, bought something quickly, and rushed to Willowbrook Village.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thinking about Chad makes me want to hit him! Having three kids served him, and he has a daughter himself, yet he still raped others! I&#39;ll definitely sneak a few kicks at him to vent my anger!&#34;</p>
