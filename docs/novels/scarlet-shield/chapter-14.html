                <p>Alexander got what Robert was hinting at right away. He hesitated, &#34;You mean...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert grinned, &#34;You&#39;re both interns. You&#39;ve seen how cramped our department is. Sharing a desk isn&#39;t a big deal since we&#39;re barely in the office anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Alexander could say anything, Robert had already set Zoey up at his desk. &#34;Alright, Zoey, you sit here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Robert turned and went off to handle other stuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey wanted to say no, but after seeing the state of the detective department, she reluctantly agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, being the nice guy he was, somehow found an extra chair and asked her warmly, &#34;Do you want to sit next to me or across from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey took the chair from him and chose to sit across. She wasn&#39;t too fond of him and besides, there was a window behind that spot. When the weather was nice, the sunlight would stream in, and she loved the warm, comforting feeling of the sun on her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert came back to his messy desk, rummaged through the piles of documents, and tossed a stack of files onto their desk. &#34;These are the missing persons cases from the past three months, from around Lawrence&#39;s current and previous residences. Take a good look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey and Alexander both said, &#34;Alright,&#34; and split the files between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At ten that night, Robert got a call. From his reaction, it seemed like it was about the two officers who had gone to check out a residence but hadn&#39;t gone in. He cursed, grabbed his car keys, and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the day turned into night, the energy in the office seemed to drop. It wasn&#39;t as noisy as during the day; everyone was pretty quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at the mountain of case files and yawned, feeling exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stretched out of habit, and Alexander, sitting across from her, instinctively looked up and asked, &#34;Are you hungry? There are late-night snacks here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not hungry,&#34; she replied flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;The free late-night snacks in our cafeteria are pretty good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that it was free, Zoey stood up. &#34;Where are they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was definitely a difference between the city police department and their county one. Not only was the office nicer, but even the cafeteria looked like a college dining hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were all kinds of food, making it hard to choose. Not only were the three meals free, but even the late-night snacks were, which was great for someone as broke as Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey got her favorite pasta and looked around while eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There weren&#39;t as many people as during the day, but there were still quite a few coming and going. Some even brought their files, working as they ate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear that the city police department was super busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly finished her plate and grabbed a piece of toast to take away. Alexander saw this and was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander asked, &#34;Didn&#39;t you have a big dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey rolled her eyes at him. &#34;Is it your business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was quiet for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you got me wrong,&#34; he said, &#34;I was just worried you might eat too much and not digest well. Don&#39;t girls usually care about their figure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like being a bit chubby,&#34; Zoey said, taking a big bite of the toast and grinning at Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander went silent again. He instinctively picked up his water cup and took a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was definitely not someone you could judge by normal standards. She was never ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander knew Zoey well; she had an incredibly strong will and was relentless in her quest to catch criminals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just gave her a light glance and didn&#39;t say anything more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Zoey finished eating and got back to the office, Robert was leading two people inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bumped into Zoey and Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert took the chance to introduce Zoey, &#34;This is Dennis Gonzalez, look at this outstanding guy, barely any hair left.&#34; He joked, patting Dennis on his bald head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to Dennis, Robert still had quite a bit of hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert then added, &#34;The guy next to Dennis is Charles Green. He&#39;s only been with the team for a year. He&#39;s a bit older than you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles Green. Zoey repeated the name in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Dennis. He had a stern face. If he weren&#39;t in the detective department, she might have mistaken him for a criminal and followed him for a few blocks based on her gut feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fierce look, combined with his role as a cop, actually made him seem more secure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled warmly at Zoey, &#34;Zoey, nice to meet you. If you need anything, just let me know and I&#39;ll help you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey politely replied, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she looked at Charles. Standing next to Dennis, they were really worlds apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles had a delicate and handsome face. If you looked closely, he was quite cute. His innocent eyes made it hard to believe he was a detective, because he always had a bit of a foolish look. When he spoke, he even seemed a bit dim-witted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, do you like snacks?&#34; He reached into his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could respond, he had already handed her some candy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t refuse. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome. We&#39;re going to be good friends fighting side by side.&#34; Charles patted Zoey on the shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used so much force that he almost knocked Zoey over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that they were getting along, Robert waved his hand. &#34;Alright! Now that everyone knows each other, let&#39;s get to work!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone went back to their spots. Zoey sat down and immediately opened one of the candies Charles had given her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only was the packaging fancy, but the taste was also really good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a photo and tried to find it online to buy some for herself. After searching for a while, she realized the candy was quite expensive because it was imported! She couldn&#39;t afford it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey quietly closed the browser on her phone and continued to go through the case files.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she knew it, she started to feel sleepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey wrote down the names of the victims she thought were important in another folder.</p>
