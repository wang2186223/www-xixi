                <p>Similarly, both experienced domestic violence from men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was there such a big difference in Ruby and Lucille&#39;s reactions?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although her position as a police officer didn&#39;t allow her to praise a suspect, she had already given Lucille a mental thumbs-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They couldn&#39;t always back down; this was true gender equality!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Domestic violence?&#34; Lucille sneered at Paul&#39;s testimony. &#34;Come on, Paul, how can this be domestic violence? Weren&#39;t we just fighting each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She calmly walked behind the teddy bear, took out the surveillance device she had placed there in advance, and transferred all the content to her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she found the uploaded video on her phone and showed it to John.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul suddenly realized why Lucille laughed after being hit, and he was terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t dare to speak for a moment. His first reaction was to scrutinize Lucille carefully. Seeing that the swelling on her cheek from his slap was gone, he felt relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; John finished watching the video on the phone, which clearly recorded everything that had happened between the two, including their words and actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was mutual fighting, not domestic violence.&#34; John gave his opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Paul was not having it. &#34;No! How can you say that? I just slapped her once, but look at what she did to me! She kicked my dick and kept kicking me. She was clearly trying to kill me! If you had come a little later, I would be dead! How can this be mutual fighting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t just let this go!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma, who had been silent, finally understood, &#34;Are you serious? How much strength can a woman like her have? She hit you a few times, and you&#39;re already crying out? I don&#39;t see any injuries on you. Are you trying to cause trouble? We handle things according to the law. If you&#39;re not satisfied, you can appeal! Mr. Williams said this is a family dispute, so it&#39;s a family dispute. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul was so angry that he almost ground his molars to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at Lucille with furious eyes, but accidentally caught her provocative and smug smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, the anger in his heart surged uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt nothing else, only one thought in his mind. &#39;Lucille, you must die.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul lunged forward and grabbed her throat, squeezing tightly. &#34;Die, you bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille didn&#39;t move or resist at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Paul pinned her against the wall, John threw him to the ground with a shoulder throw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he restrained Paul&#39;s arms with great force, making Paul scream in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trying to kill someone in front of the police?&#34; John easily subdued him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to fight back, Paul could only curse Lucille. &#34;You bitch, marrying you was the worst thing that happened to our family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Paul continued to spew filthy words, John increased the pressure, trying to make him shut up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to ask Lucille how to handle this when Emma shouted, &#34;Mr. Williams, he&#39;s bleeding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John frowned slightly and released Paul. He saw that the bleeding was coming from Paul&#39;s crotch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering Paul&#39;s earlier complaint about Lucille kicking his dick, he and Emma exchanged glances, stunned for a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Paul was already numb with pain, feeling nothing below. Seeing their horrified expressions, he slowly looked down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was completely unsure of the condition of his dick and was already losing his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul&#39;s eyes were filled with a mix of anger and fear, and his whole body trembled, &#34;My, my dick, my family is counting on me to have children. I... Mr. Williams, save me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, John immediately dialed the emergency number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After giving the address, he turned and instructed, &#34;Don&#39;t move! What if the wound expands?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul was too scared to move anymore. His movements were very slight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a man, John fully understood Paul&#39;s mindset at this moment. Looking at the blood on the ground and the bleeding area, he sighed helplessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and struggled to lift Paul. &#34;Emma, let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They couldn&#39;t wait for the emergency team on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would take some time for the emergency personnel to arrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least getting downstairs would save some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul was heavy, and John gritted his teeth to hold on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma slowly came to her senses and followed John.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them hurried away, completely ignoring Lucille, who was watching the drama unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they disappeared from that floor, Lucille couldn&#39;t hold back anymore and burst into laughter, especially when she saw the blood on the ground, laughing even harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed until her stomach hurt, but as she laughed, an indescribable feeling welled up inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt an overwhelming urge to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille allowed herself to cry for a while, then called Zoey. &#34;I took revenge as you said, but there was a little accident. I kicked his dick and made him bleed. Is that a problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, playing with the cat, answered nonchalantly. &#34;As long as he&#39;s not dead, it&#39;s fine. If they ask you anything else, just insist it wasn&#39;t intentional. Remember, it was an accident during your mutual fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it!&#34; Lucille etched every word Zoey said into her mind. &#34;I still have the injury report from when he hit me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But after this, if he still doesn&#39;t want to divorce me, what should I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey put down the cat toy and thought for a moment. &#34;Do you know where Paul works?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I do.&#34; They were married; how could they not know each other&#39;s workplaces?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Do you have any of his colleagues&#39; Facebook contacts? If not, find them. If he refuses to divorce, post the videos of him abusing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men were strange creatures. In private, they might not be good people. But in public, they had to pretend to be good people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All in all, Men were extremely complex creatures. They might joke about a woman&#39;s body or looks in private, but publicly, they would condemn someone for insulting another&#39;s appearance, deeming it morally wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To put it more bluntly, they might hit their wives, but if others knew they hit their wives, they would find it shameful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille was surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to Zoey&#39;s strategies, she increasingly felt that this didn&#39;t seem like something a cop would do.</p>
