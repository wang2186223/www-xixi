                <p>Zoey strolled over to the bedroom next to the master bedroom. She nudged the door open and stepped inside. The room was bare except for a wooden bed, looking like it hadn&#39;t been touched in ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious this room didn&#39;t see much action. Lawrence probably never came in here; there were no signs of life at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s cop instincts kicked in, and she started poking around. She yanked open the heavy curtains, letting the sunlight flood in. A corner of the curtain knocked some dust off the windowsill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a bit sleepy, she yawned, glanced out the window at the neighborhood, and was about to head out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she passed the nightstand, she stopped dead in her tracks. Something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Lawrence was a clean freak, why would he clean the nightstand but leave the windowsill dusty? Anyone who had ever cleaned a room knew it was easy to wipe down a small area. This inconsistency meant...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you looking at? The tech team already checked everything.&#34; Alexander&#39;s sudden voice made Zoey jump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled herself together, her brows knitting in annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander noticed she was pissed at him but didn&#39;t seem to care. &#34;Find anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey snapped, &#34;Does the difference in dust thickness count as a discovery?&#34; She shot him a look and continued, &#34;The nightstand is spotless, but the windowsill has a thin layer of dust. If Lawrence was a neat freak, he wouldn&#39;t miss that. So I think someone else lived here, and Lawrence wiped out all traces of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey started opening the drawers one by one. They were empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lawrence doesn&#39;t have a girlfriend, right?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander replied, &#34;He said he didn&#39;t when we interviewed him, but who knows if that&#39;s true. The surveillance in this old neighborhood is pretty bad, and getting footage from other spots would be a hassle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about his neighbors?&#34; Zoey asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re not around. We don&#39;t know why yet. We haven&#39;t even talked to the only employee at Lawrence&#39;s supermarket,&#34; Alexander said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s frown deepened. &#34;If Lawrence has been living alone, this neighborhood is perfect for covering up a murder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even though this place is old and rundown, it&#39;s convenient. There&#39;s a subway and bus stop right outside, a food street nearby, and all the essentials for living. Plus, it&#39;s close to his supermarket,&#34; Alexander replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey shot him a cold look. &#34;Rich people just don&#39;t get our world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to target me,&#34; he finally said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey yawned. &#34;I just call it like I see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to leave, but Alexander blocked her at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the doorframe, looking at her. &#34;Do we really have to do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what?&#34; Zoey replied coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;I was just sharing my opinion, but you always have to contradict me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey lifted her head, her tone serious. &#34;I&#39;m just being real. How could rich folks possibly get what it&#39;s like for us regular people? Ever been broke? And you should check out more homes. That robot vacuum cleaner he&#39;s got is probably a rare sight in this whole city.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Zoey&#39;s eyes, it was way too extravagant. Most people were all about saving money, focusing on practical stuff instead of dropping thousands on a fancy vacuum cleaner. It just didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey went on, &#34;For a single guy with such a high standard of living, why would he rent a place like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added, &#34;These days, there are plenty of nice apartments around. Do you think someone making over ten grand a month would spend three thousand to rent a dump like this? And he even left one room empty instead of using it for storage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had to admit, she had a point. &#34;You think Lawrence kept a woman locked up in this room for a long time? If that&#39;s true, it could explain a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gap between the two victims was really short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s lips curled into a cold smile. &#34;Move aside! Don&#39;t block me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out to push him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood firm with just a little effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seeing Zoey&#39;s face darken, Alexander decided to step aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled back with a grin, giving her space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had no choice but to brush past him to get out. As she did, Alexander&#39;s unique scent hit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She vaguely remembered that during their combat class at the police academy, when they sparred, he had the same scent. She didn&#39;t know if it was cologne or something else, but he was definitely vain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey rolled her eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that the investigation at Lawrence&#39;s house was almost done, Zoey noticed Robert on the phone, looking serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean you can&#39;t get into their house even with a search warrant? The internet tells people to be wary of strangers every day, but it doesn&#39;t say to be wary of the police! I don&#39;t know if these people are too cautious or what! Show them your badges properly and get them to cooperate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert noticed Zoey watching him out of the corner of his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung up the phone and waved her over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey walked over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert gave her a long look, the smell of smoke heavy in the air. &#34;I told Mark that until this Lawrence case is over, you&#39;ll be sticking with me. No need to go back to your team for now. I&#39;ll take you and Alexander to grab a bite to eat, then show you around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey nodded. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was late autumn, and at five in the afternoon, the city wasn&#39;t completely dark yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert took Zoey and Alexander to a random restaurant. The waiter handed over the menu, and Robert politely gave it to the only woman among them. &#34;Ladies first, order whatever you want; don&#39;t be shy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey seriously looked at the menu and ordered everything she wanted.</p>
