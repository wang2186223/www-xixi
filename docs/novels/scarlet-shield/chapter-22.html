                <p>Alexander felt pretty shaken up inside by Zoey&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in their police academy days, he thought he&#39;d found a kindred spirit. They were on the same wavelength, always bouncing ideas off each other. He dove deep into those cases, analyzing every detail, all because of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was all in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey never saw him as a rival. To her, it was all about the scholarship, and he was just the biggest obstacle in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t even describe how he felt right now. It was worse than a desperate counterattack. He was heartbroken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath and asked, &#34;The police academy&#39;s tuition is higher than regular schools. With your smarts, you could&#39;ve gone anywhere. Why insist on the police academy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey rolled her eyes, &#34;What&#39;s it to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander fell silent. She didn&#39;t care about anything he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey turned back to the car window, &#34;Are we going back or not? If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll tell Officer Davis you&#39;re slacking off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was speechless. He had no way to deal with Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He restarted the car, and they drove back in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the police station, Dennis and Charles immediately surrounded them, eager for updates. &#34;How&#39;d it go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;We went to Lawrence&#39;s supermarket and talked to the lower-level employees and their team leader. Aside from their personal opinions of Lawrence, almost everyone knew he liked to bring women&#39;s clothes and wigs to work. This pretty much confirms our suspicions about Lawrence!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis nodded excitedly, admiration flashing in his eyes as he looked at Zoey, &#34;Great work. I&#39;ve got something even better! Remember the bloodstain in the bathroom? It&#39;s confirmed to be from the missing Lily!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then he sighed. &#34;However, the long hair Alexander found under the mirror doesn&#39;t match any of our suspected victims. It&#39;s not from any of the three women.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This suggested there might be a fourth victim they hadn&#39;t found yet. They needed to expand the search, but they still didn&#39;t know where to start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expanding the search from three months of missing women to six months would require a lot of police resources.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not to mention those, what if the family of the owner of the long hair hadn&#39;t reported her missing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Robert joined the discussion, &#34;Lawrence is a clean freak. He even bought a robot vacuum to keep his place spotless. Do you think he wouldn&#39;t clean under the mirror? We saw the long hair right away. Wouldn&#39;t Lawrence see it? I told you it wasn&#39;t necessary to bring it back, but you insisted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is it not necessary!&#34; Charles only dared to talk to Robert like this when discussing the case, &#34;Now we can confirm there&#39;s a fourth person, can&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then go find the fourth person yourself. This task is all yours,&#34; Robert frowned, utterly speechless at Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles knew this investigation was going to be a headache, so he picked up his phone and started searching for something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The impromptu &#34;meeting&#34; wrapped up, and everyone went back to their tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Zoey&#39;s first time in a discussion since her transfer, and she was so caught up in the heated atmosphere that it took her a moment to snap out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander noticed and chuckled, &#34;You&#39;ll get used to it. They argue all the time, but it&#39;s no big deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey ignored him and went back to her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander fell silent. Was he being ignored again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things were moving fast, and now they had both witnesses and physical evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the case shifting from stalking to a criminal investigation, Robert had Lawrence transferred from another station&#39;s holding cell to theirs for the next round of questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Lawrence hadn&#39;t lived in his current place for long, he denied everything, &#34;I don&#39;t know anything. It must&#39;ve been left by the previous tenant. You guys are cops, but you can&#39;t just frame me, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were only holding Lawrence as a suspect for now, without much solid evidence. His constant denials were making the interrogation tough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Lawrence didn&#39;t confess, it remained a criminal case. No one was dumb enough to send themselves to prison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence was sure they had no evidence; otherwise, they wouldn&#39;t need his confession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone looked pretty grim as they gathered again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see Lawrence&#39;s attitude? Total provocation! He&#39;s sure we can&#39;t find the bodies, so he&#39;s playing games with us!&#34; Robert slammed his fist on the table, &#34;For now, there&#39;s no better way. We need to look for clues in the surveillance footage. You guys handle Lawrence&#39;s movements from three months ago. You and Zoey will cover the area around his current residence. Keep investigating and interviewing. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey nodded, &#34;Got it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lawrence&#39;s current place was in an old complex called Pleasantville Apartments. The surveillance was pretty lacking, making Zoey and Alexander&#39;s investigation and interviews a pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about the possibility that Lawrence might be responsible for more than just three lives, Zoey and Alexander were even more determined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To avoid wasting time on evidence collection, they backed up all the surveillance footage they could find, even from nearby shops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey felt a bit hungry on the way and grabbed a hot dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her eat so heartily, Alexander couldn&#39;t help but comment, &#34;You have a good appetite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander thought, &#39;In such a pressing situation, she still has time to eat.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey replied, &#34;If I don&#39;t eat, how can I have enough energy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly finished her food and got back to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they returned to the station, Alexander suddenly stopped at the entrance, looking at Zoey seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;Lawrence doesn&#39;t have his own car. If he really is the serial killer, how did he transport these people without leaving any traces? Could it be dismemberment?&#34;</p>
