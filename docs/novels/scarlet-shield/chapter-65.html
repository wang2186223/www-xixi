                <p>After a long time,  Zoey and Emma simultaneously woke up by John&#39;s calls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, John walked over to Emma, who took off her headphones and glanced at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ruby said no one can pick up her kid and hopes we can help. You go, I sent the address to your Facebook,&#34; John said, frowning with displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Emma&#39;s anger flared up instantly!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a cop, not a nanny! This kind of crap seemed not her responsibility!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Williams, her husband caused her to miscarry? He can&#39;t go to the hospital to take care of her? Can&#39;t even find time to pick up the kid? Is that even his biological daughter?&#34; Emma&#39;s frustration was palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John was also very impatient. &#34;Her husband got drunk last night and didn&#39;t care about Ruby&#39;s miscarriage at all. He said losing the baby was fate. You go, otherwise, the kid will be left at school alone and that&#39;s really pitiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing John say this, Emma had no choice but to endure it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the kid was innocent, wasn&#39;t she innocent too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma packed up her things, cursing as she left the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey watched her back, really grateful she got out early, otherwise, she&#39;d be the one being used as free labor now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was time to get off work, Zoey stretched and left the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just taken a few steps out of the police station when she saw a couple arguing and pulling at each other at a nearby intersection, clearly another dispute to resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey happened to be off the clock and didn&#39;t have to deal with these disgusting matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking this, her steps quickened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she passed by the two, the man yanked the woman far away and slapped her hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound was loud, indicating how much force he used.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey cursed in her head, thinking only incompetent men would resort to hitting their wives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Women were already a vulnerable group, it was a shame for men to bully women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe because of the onlookers, the woman&#39;s face swelled up, but she didn&#39;t shed a tear. She was much tougher than Ruby. &#34;Fuck! You hit me? In front of the police station!&#34; She said, ready to fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was too weak, easily pushed away by the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman was once again overpowered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man raised his hand and slapped the woman again, his eyes full of disgust!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t really want to get involved in this, but there were surveillance cameras at the police station entrance. As a cop, it wouldn&#39;t look good if she just walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought for a moment, took out her phone, and started recording the two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The video showed the man slapping the woman several times, the woman unable to fight back, getting beaten up by the man. Only then did Zoey put away her phone and step forward: &#34;Watch your behavior, this is the police station entrance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None of your business, get lost!&#34; The man pushed Zoey away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman, afraid of Zoey getting hurt, quickly told her to leave, claiming it was their own matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey handed the phone to the woman and helped her position it for recording. &#34;Hold it tight, make sure to get his face. You need to testify for me, he hit first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman looked at her in shock, not understanding what she meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, Zoey&#39;s eyes turned sharp, and she threw the man over her shoulder, slamming him to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still not satisfied, she grabbed the man&#39;s hair like dealing with a vicious criminal, pinning one of his arms and lifting his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was easily subdued by Zoey, his bones making cracking sounds, though he was in too much pain to know which ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman watched in shock, her mouth opening, unable to process what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly, the man realized what was happening and tried to break free with all his might, cursing Zoey. &#34;You dare sneak attack me! I&#39;ll kill you now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, trying to fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey swiftly flashed her badge in front of him. &#34;Try it, see if you prefer getting beaten by me or being charged with assaulting a cop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the two quiet down, Zoey asked the still-shaken woman. &#34;You want to go to the police station, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman, still in shock, just nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey took the phone back from her, stopped the recording, and led the two back to the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they entered, they ran into John, who was dressed in plain clothes and about to go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey forced a smile that looked more and more creepy. &#34;Mr. Williams, we have a situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John was silent, wondering if the police station couldn&#39;t function without him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John glanced at the man, who now had a black eye from Zoey&#39;s punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then observed the woman and returned his gaze to the beaten man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman was small, the man strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked, &#34;Are you trained?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman guessed what he meant and awkwardly waved her hand. &#34;I didn&#39;t hit him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey solved John&#39;s confusion. &#34;I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John was silent, realizing he couldn&#39;t go home now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the interrogation room, John glanced at the righteous Zoey beside him, recalling her previous case-handling style, and sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began questioning the man and woman. &#34;What&#39;s your name? What do you want to resolve here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman, both aggrieved and angry, spoke first. &#34;I&#39;m Lucille Morgan, he abuses me! I want to press charges! Look at what he did to me! Officer, you should give him the harshest punishment, don&#39;t let him out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Lucille, the man was the first to object. &#34;No, can you speak clearly? Don&#39;t let people misunderstand, what do you mean I abuse you? Look at the marks you left on me. Just because I&#39;m a man, I deserve this? I&#39;ll press charges against you for abuse too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man turned to John. &#34;I&#39;m Paul Howard, her husband. I can&#39;t take it anymore, she always scratches me! Look, if she presses charges, I will too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille added, &#34;What do you mean by that? Am I not telling the truth? Didn&#39;t you abuse me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul retorted. &#34;Abuse you? I pushed you once, and you call that abuse? You always bring up everything from before we dated, if your memory is so good, why don&#39;t you remember something useful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille snapped, &#34;Stop with the nonsense, you did abuse me! You not only pushed me, but also slapped me.&#34;</p>
