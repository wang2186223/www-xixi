                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll never be like that!&#34; Rilla suddenly yelled, completely losing her cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s words had struck a nerve deep within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In all their interactions, this was the first time Zoey had seen Rilla so unhinged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey glanced at her, unfazed. &#34;Based on what we know, everything Hugh said checks out. The three victims committed suicide out of guilt. In this village, a woman&#39;s worth is tied to her ability to have kids, right? They thought they couldn&#39;t get married anymore, so they saw suicide as the only way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s ridiculous!&#34; Rilla shouted again, her eyes dark and furious. &#34;Hugh is lying! It&#39;s a miracle he didn&#39;t harass those women. Them harassing him? Have you seen him? He&#39;d be over the moon if anyone showed interest in him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rilla, you should act like a college student. If you start making baseless accusations, you&#39;re no better than the other villagers in Willowbrook.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla&#39;s eyes were filled with rage. Zoey&#39;s words only fueled her anger. &#34;Your cops are useless! How could you come up with such a ridiculous conclusion? This case has nothing to do with me, but even as an outsider, I find it laughable. Can you honestly say that again and believe it makes sense? No one would accept this! I certainly don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert, sensing the rising tension, stepped in with a hint of frustration. &#34;Rilla, whether you accept it or not doesn&#39;t matter. You didn&#39;t know them, and you&#39;re not their family. Your opinion doesn&#39;t count. The case has been ruled a suicide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla looked at Zoey and Robert in disbelief, her expression shifting from shock to resentment, and finally, she closed her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed bitterly. &#34;I thought you were serious about your work and would be good cops. Turns out, you&#39;re just hypocrites making up stories to get the job done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey remained unfazed by her sarcasm. &#34;Yeah, in your eyes, I&#39;m not a good cop. So why should I tell you about Haven?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Zoey use this to threaten her again, Rilla was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Rilla fall silent, Zoey smiled slightly. &#34;So, don&#39;t insult the cops so casually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla was trembling with anger. To find out Haven&#39;s whereabouts, she had to swallow her pride and apologize. &#34;I admit, I got a bit too emotional earlier. I shouldn&#39;t have called you hypocrites. I am sorry. I&#39;m really hoping you can tell me where Haven is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Rilla change her tune so quickly, Robert was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey leaned in closer to observe Rilla, a faint smile playing on her lips. &#34;I accept your apology. Now, I&#39;ll tell you where Haven is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla&#39;s eyes were fixed on Zoey, waiting for her to continue. &#34;Haven couldn&#39;t have kids and felt like she let Hugh down, so she chose to end her life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla clearly didn&#39;t buy it. She glared at Zoey with pure hatred. &#34;Are you even real cops? How can you twist the truth like this? It&#39;s impossible. Do you have any proof?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey pulled out an evidence bag, containing Haven&#39;s phone. &#34;This is Haven&#39;s phone. You should recognize it. There&#39;s a video she recorded herself... a suicide note, explaining everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A suicide note? A video?&#34; Rilla was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up in a panic, reaching for the phone. &#34;Let me see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey quickly pulled the evidence bag away, not letting her grab it. &#34;No, it&#39;s not convenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla was about to faint from anger, but thinking of Haven, she had to hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recalling her memories with Haven, she still couldn&#39;t believe Haven would commit suicide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips trembled. &#34;Haven isn&#39;t dead, right? You&#39;re lying to me, right? She wouldn&#39;t commit suicide. Even if she did, it must have been Hugh and his family who forced her. I told her that a woman&#39;s worth isn&#39;t just about getting married and having kids. I told her many times, and she agreed with me. We were going to see the ocean together. Why would she commit suicide? Even if she couldn&#39;t have kids, she doesn&#39;t need to die..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t accept the news of Haven&#39;s death, teetering on the edge of a breakdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey saw that she had lost the ability to think clearly, mumbling to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking advantage of the moment, Zoey said, &#34;Why would Hugh and his family force her to commit suicide? And why can&#39;t you accept this fact? Aren&#39;t you the one who likes to manipulate others into committing suicide?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s different, they were...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla suddenly realized what Zoey had said. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, aren&#39;t you the one who likes to encourage others to commit suicide? Did you tell your good friend to do it too? Even if you didn&#39;t mean to, maybe she took it that way.&#34; Zoey&#39;s smile was devoid of warmth. &#34;And those strange ideas, reincarnation, heaven... they do sound appealing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla knew Zoey was trying to trap her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she couldn&#39;t stand Zoey using Haven as an example.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could a casual word or story from her lead to their deaths?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up! I never said those things to Haven!&#34; Rilla was agitated, defending her friendship with Haven. &#34;Haven wasn&#39;t naive. She wouldn&#39;t die because of something I said. I just wanted her to live well. Those things I said were only to comfort those poor fools.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poor fools? Who do you mean?&#34; For the first time, Zoey felt a bit of a connection with Rilla. &#34;Let me guess, Janet, Faye, and Sadie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rilla clammed up completely, refusing to speak further.</p>
