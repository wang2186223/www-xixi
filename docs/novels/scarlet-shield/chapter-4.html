                <p>Emma shot a glance at John, who was sipping his coffee. She blinked and tried to sound casual. &#34;What&#39;s Zoey even thinking? She ditches our cases to help Officer Jones with basic stuff. People might think you didn&#39;t train her right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John barely lifted his eyes to look at Emma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s heart skipped a beat, and she quickly looked away. Realizing she looked guilty, she forced herself to meet John&#39;s gaze with a wry smile. &#34;Just saying, Officer Williams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re cops. When the country and the people need us, we follow orders. Pretty sure your instructor drilled that into you on day one,&#34; John said, blowing on his coffee, sounding indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s fingers dug into her palm, and she forced a smile. &#34;Sorry, I misspoke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let me hear that again,&#34; John said, turning back to the case files.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him, Emma bit her lip, still a bit defiant. &#34;Officer Williams, I&#39;m just worried. Zoey&#39;s so reckless, she might mess things up for Officer Jones, and that could come back on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John paused, his eyes flickering slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Zoey was stumbling off the subway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was supposed to meet the informant at this subway entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she exited from Entrance A, she spotted a girl with black-rimmed glasses, clutching a canvas bag, looking around nervously by the escalator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey walked up to her. &#34;Ella Garcia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella looked up, nervously adjusting her glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you Officer Brown?&#34; Ella asked, glancing behind Zoey with disappointment. &#34;Didn&#39;t Officer Jones come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m still an intern,&#34; Zoey said bluntly. &#34;Officer Jones is busy, so he sent me to get some info from you first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella clutched her bag straps, looking down in disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew it; no one believed her. Even Mark, as nice as he was, must have found her annoying. Otherwise, he wouldn&#39;t have sent this intern Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at the dejected Ella and frowned. &#34;This isn&#39;t the place to talk. Let&#39;s find somewhere to sit and chat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella nodded. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They found a nearby beverage shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ordering drinks, they sat down. Ella clutched her cup tightly. &#34;Officer Brown, ask whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey took out a notebook and pen, looking at her indifferently. &#34;I&#39;ve read your previous report. In the past week, have you felt like someone is watching you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella shook her head, looking bitter. &#34;No, but I can&#39;t be sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey frowned. Police work needed evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words like &#34;think,&#34; &#34;maybe,&#34; and &#34;possibly&#34; were the last things they wanted to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked, &#34;Then why did you report again, saying you felt someone was watching you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella was stunned. &#34;It&#39;s just a feeling. A few days ago, I didn&#39;t feel it, but this morning, as soon as I left the house, it came back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she finished, she noticed Zoey, who had been sitting upright, suddenly relaxed, slumping in her chair. Zoey bit on her straw, sipping her drink nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey sensed that Ella&#39;s demeanor was fragile, self-effacing, and timid. People like that often hated bothering others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ella kept reporting feeling watched, and besides her intuition, Zoey thought there must be another reason. But Ella was hiding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey frowned, deep in thought, and quickly texted Mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey: [Officer Jones, can you send me Ella&#39;s previous testimony again?]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to go over Ella&#39;s statements for any inconsistencies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella felt uneasy. She knew her words sounded shaky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had no other choice. Alone in this city, with no family or friends, she had no one else to turn to but the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was scared Zoey wouldn&#39;t believe her and hurriedly said, &#34;Officer Brown, please, everything I said is true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked up, her tone flat. &#34;I believe in solid evidence more than words. Do you have any?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella&#39;s breath caught, and she lowered her head. Suddenly, she started crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the things Zoey dreaded most was a woman&#39;s tears. No matter how unreasonable, they always left her feeling helpless. It was so annoying!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey frowned, casually pulling out two tissues and handing them over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Comforting people wasn&#39;t her thing. Zoey said, &#34;If you don&#39;t have any new evidence, should I take you home first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella knew her words alone made it tough for the police.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, Mark and his team had investigated around her but found nothing, leaving the case unresolved. With so much time passed, her words would only seem less credible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella hung her head, looking weak. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey gave her a deep look and walked with her towards her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella rented an apartment in an old neighborhood with poor security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the elevator, Ella couldn&#39;t help but ask Zoey curiously, &#34;Are you playing a mobile game?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had been glued to her phone the whole way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, even though her life was financially tight, her phone was better than Zoey&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t look up. &#34;No, I&#39;m doing a side job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A side job?&#34; Ella was puzzled, &#34;Do police officers need side jobs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey replied matter-of-factly, &#34;No choice, I&#39;m broke!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the elevator reached Ella&#39;s floor and the doors opened, Zoey stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she exited the elevator, Zoey&#39;s eyes, which had been glued to the screen, suddenly lifted, looking towards the end of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, her indifferent gaze became exceptionally sharp. But it was just a moment before she returned to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does your building have surveillance cameras?&#34; Zoey asked casually, her attention back on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella shook her head, feeling a hidden sense of shame. &#34;No, this building is old, and the property management is lax, but it&#39;s cheap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only recently graduated, and her income was limited. After covering her basic living expenses, she could only afford to rent a place in such an environment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey nodded, not saying much. She asked indifferently, &#34;Do you feel like you&#39;re being watched now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sudden question startled Ella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella instinctively glanced at the corner of the hallway, then quickly looked away like a frightened rabbit. She shook her head, her face pale. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was because she wasn&#39;t alone, even if it was just Zoey, who looked barely out of her teens, she felt a rare sense of security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Zoey responded coldly and went back to tapping on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After about half a minute, Zoey noticed no movement beside her, then she looked up at Ella in confusion, &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to open the door?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella snapped out of it, exclaiming, and quickly ran to her door, pulling out her keys to unlock it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she opened the door and was about to go in, the door opposite suddenly opened from the inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young, scholarly man appeared at the door, holding a bag of trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Ella, he smiled kindly. &#34;Just got off work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, are you heading out?&#34; Ella visibly panicked, her face turning a suspicious shade of red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man nodded. &#34;Yes.&#34; His gaze fell on Zoey, who was still engrossed in her phone. &#34;Is this your friend?&#34;</p>
