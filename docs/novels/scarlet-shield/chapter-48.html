                <p>When she opened her eyes again, she had no idea what time it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She instinctively glanced out the car window, and the fatigue on her body not only didn&#39;t dissipate but grew even stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As it was already dark outside, Zoey couldn&#39;t discern her surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert helped her open the passenger door and led her forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did the Riverside Police Department dorms move?&#34; Zoey asked with a yawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert still didn&#39;t speak, leading her a few more steps down the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Robert unlocked the door, the unfamiliar decor style caught her eye as the light hit her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she was extremely tired, she could tell that this wasn&#39;t the Riverside Police Department where she stayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey suddenly felt more awake and heard a woman&#39;s voice from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Robert, is this the excellent Zoey you told me about?&#34; A gentle-faced woman, Tenley Faye, said with a smile, welcoming Zoey at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at Tenley and recognized her as Robert&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert had mentioned bringing her to his home before, but it was delayed due to a case. Unexpectedly, Robert really meant what he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Robert, what&#39;s wrong with her? Is she sleepy or a bit shy?&#34; Tenley gave off a very warm and enthusiastic vibe, making Zoey feel comfortable even though it was their first meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley put her arm around Zoey&#39;s shoulder and led her inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the situation, Zoey greeted, &#34;Hello,&#34; then awkwardly looked at Robert. &#34;Officer Davis, this...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert admired Zoey&#39;s spirit and intelligence. He knew the police dorms were not conducive to good sleep, especially for their criminal investigation department, which was always bustling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Zoey, his eyes showing a rare hint of reluctance. &#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you before? My home is much better than the police dorms. You need good sleep quality with such high-intensity work every day. Yes, look at your dark circles. Girls should care more about their face and body than boys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faced with the meticulous care and concern from Robert and his wife, Zoey couldn&#39;t bear to refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she insisted on leaving now, Robert would definitely see her off. He wouldn&#39;t be at ease until he saw her safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Forget it. I suppose I&#39;ll just stay here for one night,&#39; she mused silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met the enthusiastic gaze of Robert and his wife again. Zoey said, &#34;Alright, then I&#39;ll trouble you for tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can it be trouble? I&#39;m more than happy!&#34; Tenley said, pulling Zoey towards her son&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to the room&#39;s size, they reached Robert&#39;s son&#39;s room in just a few steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During those few steps, Tenley introduced herself to Zoey, keeping the atmosphere lively. &#34;I&#39;m Tenley Faye, you can call me Tenley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley opened a room and gently led Zoey inside with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Zoey stepped into the small bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t big, about 215 square feet. Although it was Robert&#39;s son&#39;s room, it was cleaner and tidier than some girls&#39; rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt very cozy and lived-in at first glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey thought about Robert&#39;s son, who was in college, and asked hesitantly, &#34;Bedrooms are usually a personal and private space. If I stay here, will your son mind when he finds out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, they didn&#39;t know each other. Some people with OCD were very particular about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley quickly waved her hand. &#34;Don&#39;t overthink it. My son isn&#39;t that fussy. Rest assured, Robert told me you were coming last time, so I changed the sheets to new ones for you. See, pink ones.&#34; She spoke in a coaxing tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey felt a bit helpless but couldn&#39;t show it, because she didn&#39;t want to ruin Tenley&#39;s good intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does he know that I&#39;m staying here? Did you inform him in advance?&#34; Zoey asked anxiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haha, Zoey, treat our home as your own! Don&#39;t worry about my son&#39;s thoughts. This house is mine, and I decide who stays. Besides, he hasn&#39;t been back for a long time. Your worry is unnecessary. Just relax and stay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the sheets were changed, Zoey still felt uncomfortable intruding into someone else&#39;s private space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought it was just one night, so she decided to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of wasting time discussing this with Tenley, she might as well use the time to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;Alright, thank you, Tenley.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley was thoroughly prepared, even having set out pajamas for Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Tenley handed them to her, Zoey was stunned, as the size was one-size-fits-all, just right for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed Robert wasn&#39;t just being polite; he genuinely wanted her to stay at his home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are all the daily necessities prepared for you. If you need anything else, let me know.&#34; Tenley brought a bunch of toiletries and other items for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey expressed his gratitude again. &#34;Alright, thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey took them and went to the bathroom to take a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After blow-drying her hair, the scent of the body wash lingered in the air. The fragrance of the body wash Tenley provided was exquisite-not overpowering, but subtle, almost as if it were her natural sce</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She usually didn&#39;t use such products, fearing they would mask the smell of blood and decay as fragrance could cover up other odors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey closed the curtains and noticed a book on the desk out of the corner of her eye: &#34;Human Anatomy,&#34; &#34;Physiology&#34; series, etc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey thought, &#39;Robert&#39;s son is studying medicine?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, Zoey picked up the &#34;Human Anatomy&#34; book. The clean pages had neat, beautiful handwriting in the bottom right corner, clearly written by someone who practiced diligently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kelvin Davis. Zoey couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit envious seeing Kelvin&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How nice. Robert must have named Kelvin with love, hoping he would live freely, unburdened, and full of love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although following one&#39;s heart was a luxury in this society, it was clear how much Robert loved Kelvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of her original name before she turned eighteen, Zoey&#39;s mood visibly worsened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put the book back and went to bed.</p>
