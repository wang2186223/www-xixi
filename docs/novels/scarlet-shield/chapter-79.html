                <p>If she hadn&#39;t met Zoey at the police station, she would definitely ask Zoey to show her police badge now, to see if Zoey was really a cop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t understand Lucille&#39;s silence at all and asked, &#34;Got it?&#34;</p>

                <p>The two hung up, and the cat jumped to Zoey&#39;s side again, even rubbing against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey pushed it away, but it persisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was silent, thinking it was really troublesome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Robert and Tenley came back from grocery shopping. Tenley saw Zoey playing so happily with the cat, and her smile grew even wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, Zoey is so loving, she&#39;s so good to the big baby,&#34; Tenley praised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert echoed, &#34;Yes, don&#39;t all girls like little pets?&#34; Actually, he meant, there was no need to praise about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley put the groceries in the kitchen and came out to play with the cat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey glanced at the time, &#34;Tenley, I won&#39;t be eating dinner tonight. I&#39;ve gained a bit of weight recently, so I&#39;m going for a run to lose some.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Tenley had specifically bought her favorite meat, how could she not eat it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was good for young people to run more, considering Robert had mentioned Zoey&#39;s skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenley didn&#39;t stop her, &#34;Alright, be safe, and if anything happens, call me or Robert immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During her free time at the police station, as long as she wasn&#39;t working overtime, Zoey would insist on running every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just wanted to train her body and become stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The better she was at fighting, the better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After entering middle school, Zoey often got beaten up. Fiona, Lena, Gordon, and even Derek all believed in using violence to subdue Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They thought that if a child was disobedient, they should be beaten!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That ignorant method didn&#39;t work on her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body was in pain, but her soul told her that these people were guilty</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would never submit to guilty people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of her family&#39;s lack of love, Zoey was often bullied at school. Boys in middle school developed to be stronger than girls, and no matter how angry she was, she couldn&#39;t beat a boy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that day on, she vowed to become the toughest girl!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make up for the strength difference between genders, she started learning so-called &#39;dirty tricks.&#39; It was the same trick she taught Lucille.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be said, sometimes it worked really well. Didn&#39;t it work just as well when Lucille used it on Paul?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Lucille received a call from John. He mainly talked to her about Paul&#39;s injury report, mentioning things like torn ligaments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille had already reached the entrance of Paul&#39;s company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to the content of the call, she stopped in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paul&#39;s condition was serious, but thanks to timely medical intervention, his dick was still functional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paul has been telling us not to settle and to detain you, but the incident between you two last time wasn&#39;t recorded in our police files. This time, since he hit you first, I&#39;ve classified the case as mutual assault, not domestic violence. But I have to give you a verbal warning, don&#39;t let it happen again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I understand, Mr. Williams.&#34; Lucille was overjoyed, thinking to herself how amazing Zoey was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, no one messed with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Zoey wanted to commit a crime, wouldn&#39;t she be able to do it without getting caught?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Williams, you&#39;ve been busy with my and Paul&#39;s matters recently, thank you.&#34; Lucille said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John replied, &#34;No problem, it&#39;s my job. If you have any issues, feel free to contact me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, thank you.&#34; Lucille turned off her phone and looked at Paul&#39;s company right in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sneered and took the elevator to the twelfth floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist seemed to be a recent college graduate, looking very pretty. Her big eyes sparkled as if they could talk. She smiled warmly at Lucille and greeted her, &#34;Hello, ma&#39;am, do you have an appointment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Miss. Does Paul work here? I&#39;m his wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Howard?&#34; The receptionist said, &#34;You&#39;re his wife? He works here. Mr. Howard is great, he often buys us coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At home, when Lucille asked him to bring back a cup of coffee after work, he was unwilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at the company, he often bought coffee for his colleagues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille glanced at her a few times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Paul often bought them coffee. She was not only pretty but also spoke gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those long legs, wearing stockings, which man wouldn&#39;t be mesmerized?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist seemed to realize she had said something wrong and quickly explained, &#34;I didn&#39;t mean it that way. It&#39;s not just Mr. Howard who buys us coffee, many male colleagues do. Please don&#39;t misunderstand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille was about to get a divorce, she didn&#39;t care at all about what Paul did with others at the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if he treated others to a feast, it had nothing to do with her. She wasn&#39;t jealous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who fell for Paul&#39;s sweet talk was just meeting their fate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille acted generously and gracefully, &#34;It&#39;s just a cup of coffee. I understand, colleagues treat each other all the time. Besides, you&#39;re so pretty, you wouldn&#39;t be interested in Paul. I get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just lacked someone who would be unconditionally good to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist was puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just looked at Lucille, not knowing what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille showed indifference, &#34;I came here to get to know you all better. I don&#39;t have many friends here since I married in this place. If you don&#39;t mind, we can be friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I don&#39;t mind.&#34; The receptionist replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great, let&#39;s add each other on Facebook?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faced with Lucille&#39;s enthusiasm, the receptionist didn&#39;t know what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She politely declined Lucille, &#34;We&#39;re working now, and you see the cameras around. Our company has a strict policy against employees getting involved in each other&#39;s personal lives, so I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucille understood, she was afraid of being seen as an informant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it were usual, being rejected, she would have turned and left, hoping to see fewer people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But somehow, Zoey&#39;s image popped into her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but think, &#39;If Zoey were here, what would she do?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Lucille blurted out, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m also an unfortunate woman. I know what you&#39;re worried about. I married here for so-called love, abandoned my parents, and now I&#39;m alone in this place without a friend. Paul hasn&#39;t come home for days, and I really don&#39;t know what I did wrong, or if the other woman is just too tempting. We&#39;re all women, I hope you can understand me.&#34;</p>
