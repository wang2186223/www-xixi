                <p>Zoey asked, &#34;Do you think Hugh treats you well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s alright,&#34; Olivia replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey added, &#34;Are you happier than your friends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I don&#39;t know...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think your parents lied to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia was on the verge of breaking down from Zoey&#39;s rapid-fire questions. &#34;I don&#39;t know...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her tears about to fall, Robert quickly stepped in, &#34;Hey, don&#39;t cry. Just tell us what you know about Evan and Janet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Them? I don&#39;t know much. I don&#39;t know why he liked Janet, but he came back insisting on marrying her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;He stays home all the time. How did he even meet Janet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He does go out. Evan&#39;s mom takes him around, visiting neighbors or going to the factory. Because of Hugh, no one dares to speak ill of him at the factory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After that day, he kept bugging his mom to arrange the marriage with Janet. I heard Janet&#39;s mom agreed right away, and they set the wedding date that same day. His mom went home and started looking for a good date to throw a big wedding for Evan and Janet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was happy at the time. I had met Janet a few times and she seemed nice and kind. I thought we would get along well...&#34; Olivia&#39;s eyes showed a hint of regret. &#34;It&#39;s such a shame, at such a young age... I can&#39;t believe someone could be so cruel! How could anyone harm such a good girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert added, &#34;Was Janet home when they went to her house? What was her attitude?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she was out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know Janet refuses to marry Evan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia looked confused. &#34;I know she didn&#39;t, but her mom had already agreed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;So she didn&#39;t agree herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia replied, &#34;Her parents agreed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey added, &#34;So, her parents are the ones getting married?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia looked at Zoey, not understanding why she was being so confrontational.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t want to make it hard for her. &#34;Forget it. How&#39;s the relationship between Hugh and Evan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They get along great. Even though Hugh is busy with the factory, Evan&#39;s needs are always taken care of.&#34;After asking all the necessary questions, they let Olivia go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert watched Olivia&#39;s frail figure as she left, reflecting on the conversation. &#34;I wonder when people in these mountains will stop thinking this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey sighed. &#34;Officer Davis, this is a huge task. It won&#39;t be solved overnight. Their outdated beliefs have been passed down for generations. Changing that requires uprooting the entire system!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It also required them to have incredible willpower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert sighed deeply. He lit a cigarette because of the annoying case, something he rarely did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring in Hugh&#39;s mom,&#34; Robert ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hugh&#39;s mom walked in, she still carried an air of superiority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at others with scrutiny, disdain, and condescension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert followed protocol. &#34;Name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ava Davis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Age.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sixty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugh was forty-four, so Ava had him when she was sixteen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey didn&#39;t like Ava, but now she felt a bit of sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Davis, you look quite young. I wouldn&#39;t have guessed you&#39;re sixty.&#34; Robert looked at Ava, feeling conflicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Generations of passing down outdated beliefs made them think their way was the only right way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava didn&#39;t catch the sympathy in Robert&#39;s words and proudly responded, &#34;Of course. When life is good, with no worries, I naturally stay young.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, your sons are very grateful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely. Isn&#39;t it obvious? Hugh runs a big factory with hundreds of employees. Evan is very obedient, and Olivia is very sensible. Life is great.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds like a good life.&#34; Robert squinted, smiling at her. &#34;I heard Hugh has been married several times.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Hugh is so outstanding that no matter how many times he divorces, there&#39;s always someone willing to marry him. He&#39;s just too excellent. And each wife is prettier than the last!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;Hugh is forty-four, and Evan is only thirty-one. Why such a big age gap?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want a second child, but my mother said one child would be too lonely. Whether it&#39;s a boy or a girl, they could take care of each other when we&#39;re gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you had Evan thirteen years later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not exactly. I had several pregnancies that were girls, and I terminated them. After several times, the doctor said I might not be able to have more children, so I had it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert added, &#34;So you had Evan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it was still a girl. I had to abandon her. But the doctor was wrong. I got pregnant again, and that was Evan. He wasn&#39;t easy to come by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking three lives for Evan, which wasn&#39;t easy indeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey found it laughable. &#34;Your business is doing well, and you have a son. Why not keep a daughter? Can&#39;t you afford to raise them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ava&#39;s shrewish demeanor came out. &#34;Miss, you&#39;re wrong. Just because we have money doesn&#39;t mean we should spend it recklessly. Besides, girls are a burden here. They grow up to belong to someone else. It&#39;s not worth the investment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already have a son. If you had a daughter, most people would be happy about it! You make it sound so reasonable to take lives!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It isn&#39;t that serious. It&#39;s just valuing boys over girls.&#34; Ava was indifferent. &#34;Who doesn&#39;t want a son? Don&#39;t you? Sons can inherit the family business, but daughters can only bear children for other families.&#34;</p>
