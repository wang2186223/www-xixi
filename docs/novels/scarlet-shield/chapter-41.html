                <p>Due to the limited items in the room, it didn&#39;t take long to search everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them almost finished searching in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything in sight had nothing to do with the crime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her disdain, she maintained her professionalism as a good police officer. She put on two masks before examining the clothes to ensure that the strange odors wouldn&#39;t reach her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She searched almost every piece, seriously asking Alexander, &#34;Are all men this messy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not like this. No matter how late I get off work, I always take a shower and have the maid wash my clothes,&#34; Alexander said, showcasing his wealth to the fullest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at him with the same disdain she had for the clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wrong; she shouldn&#39;t have asked him. After all, he was the young master of the Edwards Family, who didn&#39;t need to do anything himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When a child from an ordinary family got accepted into the police academy, no matter how exhausting it was, they must persevere. This was called hard work. While Alexander was just here to experience life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the police profession, no mistakes were allowed; you must always be on high alert to ensure no criminal was missed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly thought of the question Robert had asked her before. &#34;How did your parents agree to let you apply for criminal investigation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Zoey also suddenly wanted to ask Alexander!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Alexander seriously searching the blankets and pillowcases in the room, she held back her urge to mock him. Finding evidence was the top priority after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them almost tore the room apart to find some clues in Brian&#39;s room. Yet, they still found nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s nothing in Brian&#39;s house,&#34; Zoey said calmly and coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander also agreed with her, &#34;From his family&#39;s obstruction and the locked room, there must be some evidence in this room that we haven&#39;t found.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah... so...&#34; After saying this, Zoey and Alexander both looked at the mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had searched everything in the room, and now only the mattress was left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Alexander and Zoey lifted the mattress to start searching together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey and Alexander cooperated very well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey carefully felt the mattress to see if anything was hidden inside, while Alexander checked the four corners of the mattress for any discoveries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After searching the side of the bed near the door, they lifted the mattress together again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the heavy mattress moved, a silver USB drive suddenly fell to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of it hitting the floor was quite crisp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They found it! They finally found it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them looked at the USB drive on the floor. Just as Alexander was about to bend down to pick it up, another hand snatched it first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hiding it deep is useless,&#34; Zoey said proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s expression was calm, and the tension in her eyes had disappeared, replaced by a hint of prid</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See it?&#34; She waved it in front of Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded. &#34;I see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I had waited for you to find a locksmith, this evidence might have been moved somewhere unknown,&#34; Zoey said, with a bit of a lecturing tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought Alexander needed to learn some basic knowledge and the evil of human nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll definitely learn more from Ms. Brown in the future,&#34; Alexander knew well that what Zoey said could happen because of Zara&#39;s unreasonable behavior</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you should learn more,&#34; Zoey put the USB drive in the evidence bag, giving him a cold look, &#34;This lesson is called, &#39;Act instead of talk.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was silent. Her words seemed to carry some resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They took the USB drive back to the station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Brian&#39;s room almost torn apart by the two, Zara suddenly felt a sharp pain in her chest!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zara thought, &#39;I must sue Zoey, that female robber!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the entire criminal investigation team gathered, inserted the USB drive into the laptop. Everyone stared intently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This Brian! Can he even be considered human?&#34; Dennis&#39;s hand, holding the mouse, was trembling with anger. He said in rage,  &#34;Even though these photos can&#39;t convict him, I still want to beat him up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Disgusting,&#34; Charles was just as angry as Dennis. His hand clenched into a fist, hitting the table unconsciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to their anger, Zoey and Alexander seemed a bit calmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey took the mouse from Dennis&#39;s hand and began enlarging each angle of the photos, examining the details, and started comparing the photos of the women secretly taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were about a thousand photos in the USB drive, with each girl appearing only three to four times on average.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photos were all taken of rather sensitive areas, mainly including under the skirt, thighs, face, and chest。</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These photos would make any man blush because they were too perverted. Despite being the only woman here, Zoey was calmer than anyone else as she flipped through the photos in front of three or four men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even took a piece of paper and a pen, planning to jot down some notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander came over, curious, and asked, &#34;Zoey, did you find something? What are you noting down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey said, &#34;No time for a lesson today; don&#39;t bother me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was silent, slinking back to his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes could only follow Zoey as she flipped through the photos, looking at the victims in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, when Zoey reached the 536th photo, she paused at the sight of familiar red hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hair was particularly beautiful, and as a woman, Zoey remembered it vividly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey immediately clicked to the next photo, where the red-haired woman was wearing the same outfit as before, turned around, and even had light makeup on, looking somewhat pretty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they hadn&#39;t met Lawrence before, they might have been fooled. Just as Lawrence said, they might never have traced it back to him in their lifetime. Yes, the man in the photo was Lawrence!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is even more disgusting than I thought!&#34; Dennis felt nauseated. &#34;What the hell is going on?&#34;</p>
