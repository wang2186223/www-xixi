                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve always wanted to get away from this family, but when I think about my parents, I just can&#39;t do it. Everyone in the village knows each other. If I run away, my parents will lose all their dignity. Framing Hugh was a crazy moment, but while he was gone, I was actually happy. As long as he&#39;s not around, even if his dad comes back, I won&#39;t be scared! Without Hugh, his dad wouldn&#39;t dare touch me, and I could finally have some peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what did you get out of it? Do you regret it?&#34; Zoey had seen plenty of fools, but facing someone who had been foolish along with her parents since childhood, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to hate her. &#34;You gained nothing and say you don&#39;t regret it. How stupid. You&#39;ve just moved from one prison to another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s different. If I go to jail, Hugh won&#39;t want me anymore, and I&#39;ll be free. I won&#39;t have to endure Hugh&#39;s family&#39;s maltreatment.  I won&#39;t resist, I&#39;m not as brave as Haven. She had the guts to choose another path, but I didn&#39;t. I&#39;m weak, I can&#39;t be ruthless, but this time, I was forced to choose. I can&#39;t bear to leave others, so I&#39;ll let others leave me. It&#39;s good. As long as I get away from Hugh, I can go to the city to work. Anywhere is better than being a slave here, treated like a breeding machine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, a smile unknowingly crept onto her lips, and her eyes were filled with hope and dreams for the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed like a completely different person, transformed from a lifeless, timid girl into someone vibrant and alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None of this matters to me,&#34; Zoey said. &#34;Congrats, you&#39;ve gotten smarter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia was puzzled. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Although you haven&#39;t completely freed yourself from your old mindset, at least you dare to resist,&#34; Zoey said, feeling somewhat relieved. &#34;It&#39;s better to find a new way to live than to force yourself to endure. Of course, breaking free from a cage always comes at a price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia listened for a long time, unable to understand what Zoey meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After thinking for a while, she decided to ask: &#34;Ma&#39;am, are you praising me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Praising you?&#34; Zoey laughed at her foolishness. &#34;I thought I was just speaking normally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Olivia felt speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert thought Zoey was amazing. No matter who she faced, he had never seen her flatter or praise anyone. To avoid hitting Olivia, who was trying to start anew, too hard, he coughed skillfully and interrupted their conversation. &#34;Alright, from now on, make sure to turn over a new leaf. Study hard in prison, learn more, and become someone who can adapt to normal society.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Olivia agreed readily, then asked, &#34;Sir, can I ask you a favor? Can you help me talk to Hugh and my parents about the divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and Hugh don&#39;t even have a marriage certificate. How can you divorce?&#34; Robert&#39;s words brought Olivia back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly remembered, right, they had been married for years without a certificate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking she didn&#39;t need to see Hugh and his family again, Olivia felt great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert told Olivia to go home and pack up, and they would come to pick her up later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Olivia looked at Zoey, wanting to say something but hesitating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey noticed and said, &#34;If you have something to say, just say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well... I don&#39;t know if this is related to you, but there&#39;s something I didn&#39;t mention before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Olivia swallowed. &#34;It&#39;s just Hugh and his family have done a lot of disgusting things, and only I know. When I found out Janet was going to marry Evan, I was afraid she&#39;d end up like me, so I secretly told her to run away if she could.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert frowned, &#34;Why are you only telling us this important clue now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it very important? I couldn&#39;t say it before, Ava was watching me closely. I just remembered suddenly. If it&#39;s important, you can investigate further. If not, that&#39;s even better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, thank you for the clue.&#34; Robert resolved Olivia&#39;s matter but didn&#39;t feel any happier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire investigation team seemed to be under a cloud-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All their previous deductions now had to be re-evaluated and re-investigated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apart from Chad being caught for his actions with the three female corpses, Hugh&#39;s case still needed further investigation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After going in circles, the case was back to square one, without progress at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles saw his colleagues looking dejected and tried to lighten the mood. &#34;At least we know half of it now. The truth is close. I believe we&#39;ll find out soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis yawned, his dark circles prominent, and even in his police uniform, he no longer looked sharp and spirited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting on the steps, he couldn&#39;t help but sigh, &#34;I kind of want to go back to Emerald City.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Zoey felt a connection with Dennis. She also wanted to go back, desperately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the old-fashioned mindset in this village that made it unbearable. No matter who she saw in the village, she felt inexplicably irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she talked to anyone for too long, she felt like hitting them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In such an atmosphere, it was easy to feel oppressed and powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not to mention the girls born here, even she was finding it harder and harder to endure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emerald City was busy, but every day was bustling with people, and everyone she met was educated and had the right mindset. It wasn&#39;t as mentally exhausting to interact with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, night fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another day passed quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing their work, the group walked from the church to the parking area. Passing by Faye&#39;s house, they heard a child crying inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crying was heart-wrenching, as if the child had suffered a great injustice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Dennis was the first to stop and look inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group also stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert stepped forward and knocked on the door, but there was no response. The child&#39;s crying grew more intense. Zoey, fearing the adults weren&#39;t home, kicked the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first kick didn&#39;t open it, so she kicked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The loud noise quickly attracted Cinda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the door, eyes filled with panic, but relaxed when he saw the familiar officers: &#34;Oh, it&#39;s you. What&#39;s the matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robert glanced towards the source of the crying. &#34;Why is your son crying so badly? What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
