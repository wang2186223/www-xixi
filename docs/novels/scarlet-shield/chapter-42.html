                <p>Charles had an extraordinary ability with photos and videos. His first reaction was to glance at the date below the photo. He remarked, &#34;It&#39;s been ten months since then!&#34; He calculated the days and speculated, &#34;According to the date on the photo, Brian knew Lawrence liked women&#39;s clothing a long time ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander added, &#34;When we first went to Lawrence&#39;s supermarket to take their statements, Brian didn&#39;t say that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brian&#39;s personality had left quite an impression on them. They had a particularly vivid memory of him from the day they took his statement:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;I clearly remember Brian telling us that Lawrence just liked to bring women&#39;s clothing to work, but he never said he had seen Lawrence wearing them. And ten months ago, there wasn&#39;t a single victim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the tragic incidents had only started happening in the past six months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey downloaded all the photos related to Lawrence onto the desktop. She began clicking through them one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she reached the third photo, she felt a pair of cold hands cover her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Dennis and Charles cursed in her ear, &#34;What a pervert! Fuck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s eyes were covered, and she couldn&#39;t see anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was very curious about what they were cursing at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey instinctively tried to push the hands away from her eyes, but she couldn&#39;t move them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice came from beside her, &#34;You can&#39;t look at this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was speechless. &#34;I&#39;m solving a case!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander said, &#34;Even if you&#39;re solving a case, you can&#39;t look at this. One more photo won&#39;t solve the case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey fell silent. Could someone control Alexander?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis and Charles looked at the photo and agreed that Alexander was right. They both tried to comfort her, &#34;Yeah, Zoey, listen to Alexander. One photo won&#39;t solve the case. If you want to know something, let Alexander describe it to you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander twitched his mouth. Who could tell him how to describe this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To prevent Zoey from seeing it, Dennis quickly clicked back to the normal photo interface and exchanged a glance with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander then released his hands from Zoey&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey stared at Alexander and questioned, &#34;Alexander, you&#39;re delaying my investigation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander took a deep breath, &#34;To avoid delaying your investigation, should I describe it to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were only a few of them in the office. Dennis and Charles both supported Alexander&#39;s behaviour before. This meant that the content of the photo was definitely not something good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey compromised and stopped trying to look at it, but she still wanted to know what the photos were. Could they be nude photos of Lawrence?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Zoey&#39;s eager expression, Alexander took a deep breath and tried to describe it as tactfully as possible, &#34;It&#39;s about two people of the same gender doing some indescribable things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at Alexander&#39;s stammering and guessed what he meant, asking, &#34;A video of two men having sex?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey asked again, &#34;Lawrence and Brian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded again. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Zoey was genuinely grateful to Alexander for covering her eyes, so she didn&#39;t have to see Brian naked!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t interested at all! Both Lawrence and Brian were so disgusting that just the thought of seeing them having sex would keep her up at night!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t argue with Alexander about what he had done to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander lightly coughed, trying to ease the awkward atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply shifted the topic back to the case. &#34;I still don&#39;t understand. Lawrence just has a nude photo in Brian&#39;s hands. It&#39;s not enough to cover for Brian, right? He&#39;s not afraid of death, so what is he afraid of? And since we&#39;ve caught Brian, can&#39;t Lawrence use the stuff on the USB drive to clear his name? What exactly is Lawrence afraid of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey couldn&#39;t figure out the logic either and asked, &#34;Could it be that Lawrence is not only a pervert but also mentally ill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they caught him before, didn&#39;t he say so himself? No mentally normal person would do such things. Lawrence wasn&#39;t married, so even if this got exposed, he could just move to another city and he didn&#39;t need to fear Brian. This clearly couldn&#39;t be used by Brian to control Lawrence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The case hit a dead end again, and the whole team sighed in unison. What was the connection between them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So frustrating!&#34; Dennis scratched his head in frustration. &#34;Should I just go beat up Lawrence and force him to talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one agreed with him; it was clearly a bad idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere became awkward again. Dennis saw his teammates deep in thought and remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Charles suddenly remembered something. &#34;I think I saw a similar plot in a TV show I forgot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis immediately looked at him, waiting for him to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles quickly returned to his desk, rummaging through it, and found a smartphone and an evidence bag. As he turned on the phone, he said, &#34;This is what Dennis and I found. How could I forget about this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he said, he turned on the phone in the evidence bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles continued, &#34;This was in an employee&#39;s locker at the supermarket. One of the employees&#39; slots was taken over by Brian. When we went there, the employee was complaining to a colleague about this. We wanted to know what was inside, and it turned out to be this. We originally planned to take a look, but then we heard you found the USB drive and completely forgot about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dennis couldn&#39;t understand their thoughts. He just wanted to know what kind of plot it was! Who wrote such a perverted TV show?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s locked. Looks like we got excited for nothing.&#34; Charles put the phone back in the evidence bag and said to Dennis, &#34;The plot was about the perpetrator putting the leverage in a scheduled email. If the person being threatened didn&#39;t comply, it would be sent immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, so this phone must have some big secrets?&#34; Dennis&#39;s eyes lit up as he looked at the phone in Charles&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, they didn&#39;t have the password. The quickest way was to ask Brian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about Brian&#39;s indifferent attitude during interrogation, would he admit it? He was probably trying to stall for time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander suggested, &#34;We better send it to the tech department immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On it!&#34; Charles excitedly left the team with the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of the remaining three, two were happy; one was worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey sighed deeply, &#34;Honestly, I don&#39;t have high hopes for this phone suddenly appearing.&#34;</p>
