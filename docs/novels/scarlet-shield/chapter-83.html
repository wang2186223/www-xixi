                <p>The emergency room light was still on, and they had no idea what was going on inside.</p>

                <p>In the morning, they received a call from Ruby, saying that the breakfast she made didn&#39;t suit her husband&#39;s taste. Her husband threw the freshly cooked food at her, and while trying to avoid the hot food, she accidentally hit her head on the coffee table. Blood started flowing uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her husband, realizing he was in trouble, immediately ran away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Ruby&#39;s daughter who took Ruby&#39;s phone and called Emma, then called for an ambulance. Since John wasn&#39;t around, Zoey accompanied her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucille called to tell me she divorced Paul,&#34; Zoey said indifferently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34; Emma seemed more excited than Lucille, &#34;The first time I met Lucille, I thought she was so cool! Women shouldn&#39;t be bound by outdated ideas. Really, it would have been better if Lucille had figured it out sooner! I&#39;m thrilled just hearing about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s there to be thrilled about?&#34; Zoey lazily glanced at her, &#34;Lucille is just a relatively clear-headed normal person. And Ruby, who&#39;s being resuscitated in there, is not normal. If Lucille were not normal, her fate would be the same as Ruby&#39;s. That&#39;s why the slogans always say that domestic violence happens either zero times or countless times. They just don&#39;t listen and think they&#39;re so great for enduring it for the sake of their children. Actually, all that suffering is their own doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma knew Zoey was disappointed in Ruby, but she couldn&#39;t fully agree with Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the girl sleeping on her lap, she softly said, &#34;Well, there&#39;s nothing we can do. She&#39;s just a pitiful person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey&#39;s tone was even colder than before, &#34;I don&#39;t deny that she was once a pitiful person. But when things happened, she had the ability to change but didn&#39;t want to. After that, everything that happened to her, in my opinion, is not worth sympathizing with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruby was perfectly fine, not disabled, and didn&#39;t need anyone to take care of her. She was still young, with a daughter. Why couldn&#39;t she live?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although it would be tough, it was better than being beaten every day and constantly hospitalized. A bad environment would only create a bad influence on the child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey found it laughable, &#34;No one can save her, and you shouldn&#39;t waste your efforts. Don&#39;t try to be a good person; you&#39;ll get tired and frustrated after helping her five or six times.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma moved her lips, wanting to say something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doctor came out of the emergency room and called at the door, &#34;Who&#39;s Ruby&#39;s family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma immediately raised her hand, &#34;Here, doctor, Ruby&#39;s daughter is here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor glanced at Emma, &#34;I mean an adult. Where&#39;s her husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her husband ran away. We brought her here after receiving the report,&#34; Emma slowly moved the girl&#39;s head and got up to the doctor&#39;s side. She also showed her police badge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor roughly understood and reminded me, &#34;Be prepared mentally. She has a large amount of cerebral hemorrhage, causing compression symptoms, leading to acute intracranial pressure increase and brain herniation, which is life-threatening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was stunned, &#34;Is it that serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So try to contact her family first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll do it right away!&#34; Emma didn&#39;t dare to delay such a life-threatening matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called the police station and quickly found out Ruby&#39;s parents&#39; address, asking someone from the station to contact them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing everything, she returned to her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little girl blinked her sleepy eyes and asked, &#34;Officer Thomas, when can I go in to see my mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma swallowed hard, trying to comfort her, &#34;She&#39;ll wake up soon.&#34; Then she turned her gaze to Zoey, &#34;I&#39;ve notified them. Her parents are in the neighboring city and are on their way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Zoey&#39;s Facebook notification just went off. She glanced at it, &#34;Mr. Williams said he&#39;s here. I&#39;ll leave now. I haven&#39;t finished my case from yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma responded and started comforting Ruby&#39;s daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey noticed the tears Emma was holding back and slowly said, &#34;No matter what happens to Ruby, I suggest letting her parents take the child. If they can&#39;t afford to raise her, Mr. Williams can set up a charity fund for them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This way, the girl could escape her father&#39;s clutches, and grow up in a relatively healthy environment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma might not have heard her, but still patiently comforting the girl, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, your grandparents will be here soon. Are you happy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little girl kept crying, her eyes red, &#34;I just want my mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey greeted John at the hospital entrance and returned to the Riverside Police Department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finished all her work and went to handle her resignation procedures. Since hers was more complicated, she had to go through several departments to complete it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she finally had time to pack her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around six in the evening, Emma and John returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John saw Zoey&#39;s clean and tidy desk and felt a bit reluctant. They hadn&#39;t interacted much, but Zoey had left a deep impression on him several times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used to get a headache at the mention of Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she was leaving, he felt a bit sad. It was a strange feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leaving today?&#34; John asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;ve completed the resignation procedures.&#34; Zoey said, standing up seriously and bowing to John, &#34;Thank you, Mr. Williams, for your guidance these days. No matter where I go in the future, I won&#39;t let you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>John smiled, &#34;I never really guided you much. When you first came to the Riverside Police Department, I thought you weren&#39;t fit to be a cop. Honestly, I was always thinking of reasons to transfer you to another department until you solved Ella&#39;s case. Then I thought you were perfect for being a detective. Your thinking is comprehensive and well-founded. Officer Davis from the detective team has praised you more than once. You should do well there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Mr. Williams, I will,&#34; Zoey replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was still his student, so John gave her a few more words of advice before leaving her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma returned to her desk, her eyes never leaving Zoey, feeling very complicated, &#34;The detective team is so exhausting. If there&#39;s no case, it&#39;s fine, but if there is, you&#39;ll be on call all the time. It&#39;s not as comfortable as our police station.&#34;</p>
