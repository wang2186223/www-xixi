                <p>Zoey thought back to her time at the office. Was she really being left out? No way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to reply, William sent another voice message. &#34;I don&#39;t think so. With your personality, it&#39;s probably you leaving everyone else out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey went quiet. What was up with her bad rep?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yawned, sounding tired. &#34;Mr. Harris, it&#39;s late. I gotta go. I have work tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William suddenly remembered why he contacted her in the first place and quickly sent another voice message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to tell you that Alexander Edwards got another shoutout from the criminal investigation department. They praised him big time. You two were rivals in college, so you can&#39;t let him outshine you during your internship, right? Zoey, you gotta step up your game. Don&#39;t embarrass me, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Alexander&#39;s name, Zoey&#39;s mind pictured his chiseled face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of everyone Zoey had seen, no one looked as good as Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also remembered when they got their internships, Alexander had looked at her and said, &#34;How could you just be an ordinary cop? You should join me in criminal investigation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, she thought, &#39;Who does he think he is, and why should I join him?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey looked at the ceiling and chuckled softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey messaged William back, firmly stating: [Mr. Harris, can you stop bringing him up? We&#39;re not even close.]</p>
                
                
                
                <p>William quickly sent a voice message. &#34;Yeah, right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was speechless, turned off her phone, rolled over, and closed her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Ella finished her breakfast, she was about to head to work. As soon as she opened the door, that creepy feeling of being watched came back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood at the entrance, too scared to step outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella was terrified. With trembling hands, she took out her phone and called Zoey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey, as usual, strolled into the police station with a piece of bread in her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Ella&#39;s call, she immediately answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella&#39;s voice was trembling. &#34;Officer Brown, I-I&#39;m really scared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Zoey took a bite of her bread, squinting slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella&#39;s voice was shaky. &#34;I feel like someone is watching me again, and they&#39;re really close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you? Do you see anyone suspicious?&#34; Zoey asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella paused. &#34;I&#39;m at home, in the hallway. There&#39;s no one here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was silent for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella might be a bit paranoid and unreasonable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey had taken her home last night, checked everything, and found nothing suspicious before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, early in the morning, Ella called Zoey again, saying these paranoid things. Still, that feeling of being watched was hard to ignore and was torturing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Officer Brown. Maybe I&#39;m just too sensitive. If you don&#39;t believe me, forget it. I&#39;ll go to work now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zoey was silent for a couple of seconds before replying, &#34;If you notice anything, contact me immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella hung up the phone, took a deep breath, and forced herself to step out of her home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked cautiously, looking around nervously until she got into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to breathe a sigh of relief, a hand suddenly reached out to stop the closing elevator doors!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, she screamed and grabbed her pepper spray from her bag, ready to defend herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A refined and handsome young man, taken aback by her reaction, leaned back slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, did I scare you?&#34; he asked, looking apologetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing it was her neighbor, Ella&#39;s heart settled, but the feeling of being watched didn&#39;t disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put the pepper spray back in her bag and awkwardly ran her fingers through her hair. &#34;No, I scared you, didn&#39;t I? Sorry, I&#39;ve been a bit...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella hesitated, unsure if she should say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young man looked concerned. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Did something happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the unfamiliar city, but having someone relatively familiar show concern triggered Ella&#39;s desire to confide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She told him about her suspicions, then shrank into a corner. &#34;Do you think I&#39;m just being overly sensitive and paranoid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; the man smiled, pushing his glasses up with his middle finger. The light reflecting off the lenses hid his true emotions; his tone was exceptionally gentle. &#34;It&#39;s normal for a woman living alone to be cautious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time Ella heard someone say she should be cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, when she mentioned her situation to her colleagues, one male colleague even mocked her, saying she wasn&#39;t a beauty, so no one would watch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella felt hurt. She was already insecure and timid. After the incident, she didn&#39;t dare to reveal her true feelings at work at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you!&#34; With the man&#39;s encouragement, Ella felt much better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator descended to the first floor. Ella and the man said goodbye and headed to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a busy day, her supervisor suddenly gave her a lot of work, causing Ella to leave work very late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she returned to her apartment complex, though she was tired, she still planned to feed the stray cats and dogs as usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, on the quiet path, the food bowls were full, but there were no stray cats in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening breeze rustled the leaves, stirring her sensitive nerves in the quiet environment. Ella&#39;s heart suddenly raced, and she felt extremely anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind was filled with recent news she had seen online about &#34;missing women living alone&#34; and &#34;psychopathic killers,&#34; making her face turn pale with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She instinctively wanted to call Zoey but then remembered Zoey was just an intern cop. Without any suspicious individuals or new evidence, she felt embarrassed to keep bothering Zoey. So, she put her phone back in her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella swiftly turned to head home, but as she did, she noticed a hooded figure standing at the end of the path, appearing eerie and sinister under the dim streetlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could scream, the person spoke first, &#34;What a coincidence, are you here to feed the cats too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her neighbor. Ella immediately lowered her guard, and her heart settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s you. Are you here to feed them too?&#34; Ella looked back at the empty path. &#34;It&#39;s a pity they&#39;re not here today. I wonder where they went.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the streetlight, the man smiled slightly. &#34;Maybe they were taken back by others, or they went to another complex for food.&#34;</p>
