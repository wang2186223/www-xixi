                <p>chapter Seventeen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Tessa and Lucas stepped into Tristan&#39;s apartment, their anticipation turned into confusion as they found it empty. Tessa called out for Tristan, her voice reverberating through the silent space. &#34;Tristan, where are you? It&#39;s Tessa,&#34; she called out, her voice tinged with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas glanced around the room, his brows furrowing with worry. &#34;It seems he&#39;s not here,&#34; he remarked, his voice laced with a hint of anxiety. &#34;But where could he have gone? Remember, he&#39;s unwell and not fit to go out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa nodded, her mind racing through various scenarios. She felt a mix of unease and urgency, fueled by the memory of the recent invasion at her own apartment. &#34;Let me check the kitchen. Maybe he left a note or something. I&#39;ll be right back,&#34; she said, determined to find any clue that might explain Tristan&#39;s sudden absence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas, feeling the weight of exhaustion from a long day at the academy, sank onto the bed, his mind consumed by a tangle of thoughts. In the back of his mind, insecurities and doubts resurfaced, causing him to question the nature of Tessa and Tristan&#39;s relationship. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder if there was more to their connection than mere friendship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in his thoughts, Lucas whispered to himself, &#34;So Tessa slept with Tristan in this same bed. I hope they didn&#39;t get too close. No, that&#39;s ridiculous. They&#39;re just friends. But could it be possible? Or maybe...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before his thoughts could spiral further, Tessa&#39;s sudden scream shattered the stillness of the apartment. Lucas jolted out of his reverie, his heart pounding with concern. He hurried towards the kitchen, where Tessa stood, her face pale and her eyes wide with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tessa, what happened? Why did you scream?&#34; Lucas asked, trying to catch his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa pointed towards the kitchen floor, her voice trembling with fear and urgency. &#34;Look, there&#39;s blood here. I think Tristan is hurt. The invaders from my apartment might have found him and taken him away while we were at the academy,&#34; she explained, her words rushing out in a mix of panic and determination. &#34;We need to find him. We can&#39;t waste any time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas felt a surge of panic welling up inside him, but his rational mind couldn&#39;t help but question Tessa&#39;s assumptions. &#34;Hold on, Tessa. Let&#39;s not jump to conclusions. Maybe he just went out for something, or there could be another explanation,&#34; he suggested, his voice attempting to inject a dose of reason into the tense situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s eyes narrowed, her frustration boiling over. &#34;How can you say that? Are you not concerned about Tristan&#39;s safety? He might be in real danger, and you&#39;re dismissing it,&#34; she retorted, her voice heavy with disappointment and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas was taken aback by Tessa&#39;s sudden outburst. He had never seen her so visibly upset, and her words struck him deep within his core. He realized the insensitivity of his response and felt a wave of guilt wash over him. He had let his own insecurities cloud his judgment, failing to be the supportive friend Tessa needed in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right, Tessa. I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have dismissed your concerns,&#34; Lucas admitted, his voice filled with remorse. &#34;I&#39;m just... I&#39;m scared, too. Scared for Tristan. Let&#39;s find him together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Tessa could respond, Lucas turned away, his face etched with resignation. &#34;You know what? I can&#39;t handle this right now. I need some time to think,&#34; he said, his voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas&#39;s voice trailed off as he made his way toward the door, his heart heavy with remorse and self-doubt. Tessa felt a mix of panic and guilt, realizing the impact of her outburst on their friendship. She hurriedly called out to Lucas, desperately hoping to salvage their bond. &#34;Lucas, please wait! I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to push you away,&#34; she pleaded, her voice filled with genuine remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas paused, his hand still on the doorknob, his conflicted expression reflecting the turmoil within him. He turned to face Tessa, uncertainty etched on his features. &#34;Tessa, I... It&#39;s not just about you. I&#39;m overwhelmed, and I need some time to sort through my own feelings,&#34; he confessed, his voice tinged with vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa understood the weight of his words. She knew that their friendship had been tested at that moment, and it would take time and effort to rebuild the trust that had been strained. With a deep breath, she nodded, her eyes filled with understanding. &#34;I get it, Lucas. Take the time you need. But please know that Tristan&#39;s safety is still our priority. We&#39;ll find him together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas managed a weak smile, touched by Tessa&#39;s understanding. &#34;Thank you, Tessa. I appreciate your understanding. Let&#39;s find Tristan and make sure he&#39;s safe,&#34; he said, his voice filled with renewed determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they set aside their personal tensions, Tessa and Lucas refocused on the urgent task at hand. They meticulously examined the kitchen for any clues, the sight of blood on the floor intensifying their worry. They checked the surrounding areas, hoping to find some sign of where Tristan could have gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their search yielded no immediate answers, leaving them with more questions and a growing sense of unease. Tessa&#39;s worry for Tristan escalated, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios. Lucas, too, felt a mounting urgency, his earlier doubts about Tessa and Tristan&#39;s relationship now replaced with genuine concern for their missing friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their shared determination, Tessa and Lucas decided to expand their search beyond the apartment. They reached out to their mutual friends, hoping that someone had heard from Tristan or seen him recently. As they made phone calls and sent messages, their anxiety grew with every unanswered query.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours passed, and the tension in the air became palpable. Tessa&#39;s mind raced with thoughts of possible locations Tristan could have gone to, wondering if he sought solace in familiar places or if he was in grave danger. Lucas, on the other hand, battled with guilt, regretting the time he had wasted on his own insecurities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as despair began to settle in, a knock at the door shattered the heavy silence. Tessa and Lucas exchanged glances, their hearts pounding in unison. With cautious hope, they approached the door together, their worries momentarily forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door swung open, their eyes widened in disbelief. There stood Tristan, a mix of relief and exhaustion etched on his face.Tessa rushed forward, enveloping Tristan in a tight embrace, relief flooding her every being. Lucas, too, let out a sigh of relief, a weight lifting off his shoulders. &#34;Thank goodness you&#39;re safe, Tristan. We were so worried,&#34; he said, a hint of emotion creeping into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Tessa continued to embrace Tristan, her worry quickly transformed into confusion. She pulled back slightly, her brow furrowing with concern as she looked at him intently. &#34;Tristan, what happened? What&#39;s with the blood in the kitchen?&#34; Her voice carried a mix of relief and curiosity, grateful that he was safe but eager to understand the situation.</p>
