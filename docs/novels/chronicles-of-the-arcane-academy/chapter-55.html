                <p>Tessa&#39;s cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she quickly apologized, her voice filled with genuine remorse, &#34;Oh, sorry, sir. I didn&#39;t know it was you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader of the Council of Elders chuckled softly, his tone understanding, &#34;No need to apologize, Tessa. I understand the confusion. I called to inform you that your presence is required immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity sparked within Tessa, and she couldn&#39;t help but ask, &#34;May I speak with Tristan first, please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; the leader replied, passing the communicator to Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s voice soon filled the airwaves, bringing a sense of reassurance to Tessa&#39;s racing heart. &#34;Hello, my lady, it&#39;s me, Tristan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Tessa as she spoke with a mixture of urgency and concern, &#34;What&#39;s happening? Why does the leader need us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s voice was tinged with uncertainty as he responded, &#34;I&#39;m not entirely sure. The leader wants us to gather Lucas as well. Whatever it is, it appears to be important. Although Lucas is not in the best condition, he knows about the situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry etched itself onto Tessa&#39;s face, her thoughts immediately turning to Lucas. &#34;But he&#39;s not well and stable. Is it safe for him to join us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s voice carried a note of assurance, &#34;Lucas understands his limits, but it seems the council has deemed this matter of utmost importance. We should gather together to face whatever awaits us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding in agreement, Tessa made up her mind, her determination shining through her voice, &#34;I won&#39;t waste any more time. I&#39;ll be there right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the call ended, Tessa hastily prepared herself, a whirlwind of thoughts and questions swirling in her mind. As she stepped into the corridor, her eyes caught sight of Jack, who appeared to be in a hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the opportunity, Tessa called out to him, her voice laced with urgency as she waved her hand to catch his attention. Amidst the bustling activity of the academy, her voice struggled to reach him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeterred, Tessa tried again, raising her voice, until finally, Jack&#39;s gaze locked onto hers. He altered his course and made his way across the corridor to join her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm smile greeted Tessa as Jack approached, concern evident in his eyes. &#34;Hey, Tessa! What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning the smile, Tessa couldn&#39;t contain her relief, grateful for Jack&#39;s presence. &#34;Hey, Jack! I was just wondering where you were rushing off to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack nodded, his expression serious, &#34;Yeah, I received a summons from the leader of the Council of Elders a few minutes ago. I&#39;m on my way to the meeting room right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity burned within Tessa, intensifying her desire to find out the cause of the urgent gathering. &#34;Something significant must be unfolding. I received the same summons, and Tristan mentioned that Lucas was called too. We should go together and unravel the mystery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s agreement was swift, his voice filled with determination, &#34;Absolutely. Let&#39;s not waste any more time. We must gather in the meeting room to discover the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With shared resolve, Tessa and Jack embarked on their journey, walking side by side through the academy&#39;s corridors. The sound of their footsteps reverberated against the walls, blending with their hushed conversations,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa took a deep breath, trying to calm her racing heart as she entered the meeting room. The space was filled with an air of anticipation, as the council members sat around a large oval table, their expressions ranging from curiosity to solemnity. Tristan and Lucas were already present, standing near the entrance, their gazes locked on the council members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Tessa and Jack made their way further into the room, they exchanged a glance, silently acknowledging the gravity of the situation. They found an empty spot near Tristan and Lucas, joining them in their vigil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan reached out and squeezed Tessa&#39;s hand, silently offering reassurance. Tessa returned the gesture, grateful for his presence. Lucas, despite his weakened state, wore a determined expression, showing his resolve to be part of whatever was about to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader of the Council of Elders, a figure with a commanding presence and a long white beard, stood up from his seat at the head of the table. His voice resonated through the room as he addressed the gathered individuals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you all for gathering here today. I have called this meeting to discuss a matter of utmost importance,&#34; the leader began, his tone serious. &#34;Recent events have unfolded that require our attention and decisive action.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s heart skipped a beat. She leaned closer to Tristan, their hands still intertwined, as they waited anxiously for the leader to elaborate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader continued, his voice filled with a mix of urgency and gravity. &#34;A dark force has emerged, threatening our realm and the delicate balance we strive to maintain. It is a force that seeks to exploit the powers we possess for its own malevolent purposes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers of concern and disbelief rippled through the room, the council members exchanging worried glances. Tessa felt a chill run down her spine, realizing the magnitude of the situation they were facing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To combat this threat,&#34; the leader continued, &#34;we must unite our powers, our knowledge, and our strength. Only by working together can we hope to stand against this darkness and protect our realm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s mind raced with questions, but she held her tongue, absorbing the leader&#39;s words. She glanced at Tristan, whose face mirrored her own mix of determination and apprehension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader&#39;s gaze swept across the room, his eyes meeting each council member&#39;s in turn. &#34;In the coming days, we will embark on a mission to confront this force. It will require bravery, sacrifice, and unwavering dedication to our cause. But together, we can prevail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the weight of the situation settled upon them, Tessa felt a surge of determination rise within her. She looked around the room, seeing the faces of her comrades, each one ready to face the impending challenge head-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader&#39;s voice took on a softer tone, filled with conviction. &#34;Know that the Council of Elders stands with you. We will provide guidance, support, and all the resources at our disposal. But it is up to each one of you to embrace your role, to channel your powers for the greater good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa felt a renewed sense of purpose coursing through her veins. She tightened her grip on Tristan&#39;s hand, silently affirming their commitment to the cause. The room fell into a momentary silence, the weight of the impending battle settling upon their shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>, &#34;I ask each one of you to prepare yourselves physically, mentally, and emotionally. The time to act is near. We will reconvene shortly to discuss our strategy and assign roles. May our powers unite and our spirits remain resolute in the face of adversity.&#34;</p>
