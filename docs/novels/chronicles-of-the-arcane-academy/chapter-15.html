                <p>As Tessa helped Tristan up from the floor, her hands lingered on his arms, providing him with support and stability. She could feel the warmth of his body seeping into her skin, creating an unspoken connection between them. Together, they slowly made their way towards the bed, its softness inviting them to rest their weary bodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s eyelids grew heavy with exhaustion, her energy spent from the events of the day. With a gentle sigh, she whispered, &#34;Come to bed, I think I&#39;m feeling sleepy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. Grateful for Tessa&#39;s presence, he allowed her to guide him onto the bed, his body sinking into the plush mattress. As they settled down side by side, their shoulders lightly touching, a sense of tranquility washed over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was enveloped in a serene silence, broken only by the sound of their steady breaths. Just as Tessa felt herself drifting into a peaceful slumber, a soft voice interrupted the tranquility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you sing?&#34; Tristan&#39;s voice broke through the stillness, his words laced with vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s lips curved into a gentle smile, her eyes reflecting a mixture of curiosity and tenderness. &#34;Yes, I can,&#34; she replied, her voice filled with warmth. &#34;Why do you ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s gaze softened as he met her eyes. &#34;Please sing for me,&#34; he requested, his voice carrying a subtle longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa chuckled softly, her fingers tracing delicate circles on the bedsheet. &#34;Are you a child in need of a bedtime lullaby?&#34; she teased affectionately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s smile widened, a flicker of playfulness dancing in his eyes. &#34;Not really,&#34; he confessed. &#34;But music has a way of soothing me, especially in times of healing and rest. It brings me peace and helps me find sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s understanding deepened, recognizing the power of music to heal and restore. &#34;Alright, I will,&#34; she agreed, her voice gentle yet melodious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a deep breath, Tessa began to sing. Her voice resonated through the room, carrying a soothing melody that embraced them both. Each note flowed effortlessly from her lips, infused with a sense of comfort and tranquility. The softness of her voice intertwined with the air, creating an intimate atmosphere that enveloped them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan closed his eyes, surrendering himself to the enchanting spell of Tessa&#39;s song. He listened intently, allowing the music to wash over him, drowning out the remnants of pain and fatigue. In Tessa&#39;s voice, he found solace and respite, a sanctuary from the battles they had fought and the wounds they had endured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the last notes of the song dissipated into the air, Tessa&#39;s voice lingered, filling the room with its gentle echo. Tristan&#39;s breathing grew deep and steady, a clear sign that sleep was gently tugging at him, eager to embrace him in its comforting embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa observed Tristan with a tender smile, her eyes tracing the lines of his face. Leaning closer, she pressed a soft kiss on his forehead, an act of affection and reassurance. In that moment, she felt a profound sense of love and protectiveness towards him, an unspoken promise to always be there for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the tranquil darkness of the room, their breathing fell into synchrony, creating a serene rhythm that lulled them into a peaceful slumber. Wrapped in the warmth of their shared dreams, they found solace and refuge in each other&#39;s arms, knowing that no matter what challenges awaited them in the waking world, they had found a sanctuary in each other&#39;s hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the morning sunlight streamed through the curtains, casting a warm glow across the room, Tristan slowly emerged from his slumber. He yawned, stretching his arms, and instinctively reached out to find Tessa&#39;s comforting presence beside him. However, his hand met with empty space, and his brows furrowed in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tessa?&#34; he called out, his voice laced with concern. &#34;Are you in the bathroom? Come out, let&#39;s start the day together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no response, and a growing sense of worry began to gnaw at Tristan&#39;s mind. Despite the lingering pain from his injuries, he pushed himself to sit up and swing his legs over the edge of the bed. Each movement sent a wave of discomfort through his body, but his determination to find Tessa propelled him forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With slow and deliberate steps, Tristan made his way to the kitchen, calling out her name once more in hopes of eliciting a response. The silence that greeted him only intensified his concern. He couldn&#39;t shake off the nagging thought that something might be wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by worry, Tristan&#39;s next destination was the bathroom. He pushed open the door, his eyes scanning the space, desperately seeking any sign of Tessa. But the room was devoid of her presence, and panic surged within him like a tidal wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear gripped his heart as he contemplated the worst-case scenarios. &#34;Oh my God, what could have happened to her?&#34; Tristan whispered, his voice quivering with dread. The thought of Tessa being in danger or harmed sent chills down his spine. &#34;No, no! This can&#39;t be happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind raced, trying to piece together the puzzle. Why would Tessa leave without a word? Where could she have gone? The unanswered questions weighed heavily on his chest, suffocating him with uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as despair threatened to consume him, Tristan&#39;s eyes landed on a small piece of paper resting on the table. His breath caught in his throat as he reached out, his fingers trembling with a mix of anxiety and hope. Unfolding the note, he devoured the words Tessa had penned, relief washing over him like a gentle breeze on a hot summer day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Tristan,&#34; the note began, Tessa&#39;s familiar handwriting bringing a sense of comfort. &#34;Sorry I left so soon. I didn&#39;t want to disturb your sleep. I had to rush to my apartment to prepare for my lectures. They&#39;re important to me, and I couldn&#39;t afford to miss them. Please take good care of yourself. I&#39;ll come visit you once I&#39;m done with my classes. Oh, and I forgot to mention-I prepared something for you in the kitchen. Eat and rest well. Take care of yourself. Yours, Tessa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, a mix of relief and amusement coursing through him. &#34;What a relief,&#34; he murmured to himself, his voice filled with a blend of gratitude and lightheartedness. &#34;I almost gave myself a heart attack. This girl certainly knows how to keep me on my toes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a renewed sense of calm, Tristan made his way to the kitchen, curiosity and hunger tugging at his senses. As he entered, the aroma of a delicious meal enveloped him, instantly whetting his appetite. A smile tugged at the corners of his lips as he took in the sight before him-a beautifully prepared breakfast that Tessa had left for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grateful for her thoughtfulness, Tristan settled into a chair and began to savor each bite, relishing the flavors that danced on his tongue. With each morsel, he couldn&#39;t help but reflect on the rollercoaster of emotions he had experienced in such a short span of time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The minutes ticked away, and Tessa&#39;s eyes widened in realization. &#34;Oh my God, it&#39;s almost time for the lecture!&#34; she exclaimed, her voice filled with a mix of panic and frustration. Despite meticulously preparing ahead of time, she had lost track of time and now found herself on the verge of being late. Hastily gathering her books and notes, she hurriedly made her way through the bustling corridors of the academy, her mind racing with a flurry of thoughts and her heart pounding in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she navigated the maze-like hallways, Tessa&#39;s mind couldn&#39;t help but replay the night  with Tristan. The way he had kissed her passionately, the warmth in his eyes, and the gentle touch of his hands lingered in her thoughts. There was an undeniable connection she felt, even in that brief moment, and it left her longing for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in her thoughts, Tessa rounded a corner, only to come face to face with a familiar figure. It was the witch she had defeated in the competition just the day before.</p>
