                <p>chapter Twenty-four</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you&#39;re back!&#34; Tessa exclaimed, trying to divert the conversation. &#34;Did you manage to find it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas&#39;s shoulders slumped slightly, a hint of disappointment evident in his voice. &#34;I&#39;m really sorry, Tessa. I went to three different shops, but it seems they had run out of it. I couldn&#39;t find what you were looking for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s heart sank, her hopes dashed. She mustered a smile and reassured him, &#34;It&#39;s fine, really. Don&#39;t worry yourself. It&#39;s not your fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprised by Tessa&#39;s understanding and lack of frustration, Lucas couldn&#39;t help but express his gratitude. &#34;Thank you for understanding, Tessa. You&#39;re one of a kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Lucas approached her, Tessa&#39;s heart skipped a beat. She quickly wiped away the tears that had welled up in her eyes and adjusted herself, pretending she was simply tired. She didn&#39;t want Lucas to see her vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Lucas was not one to overlook the genuine emotions of those he cared about. Concern etched on his face, he gently reached out and touched Tessa&#39;s hand. &#34;Why were you crying? What happened?&#34; he asked, his voice filled with genuine care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa felt a mixture of relief and apprehension. She wasn&#39;t ready to share the contents of the letter just yet. &#34;No, it&#39;s nothing,&#34; she replied, her voice tinged with a touch of melancholy. &#34;I think I&#39;m just feeling a little sleepy, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas wasn&#39;t convinced. He knew Tessa well enough to sense when something was amiss. Determined to uncover the truth, he sat down beside her, his eyes locked with hers. &#34;Tessa, please, talk to me. Why are there tears in your eyes? Is it because you&#39;re unhappy here? Please, don&#39;t hesitate to share. I care about you deeply. I can&#39;t bear to see you in pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard by his unwavering concern and the sincerity in his eyes, Tessa felt her heart flutter. The walls she had built around herself began to crumble. She could no longer hold back the emotions that had been bottled up within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas&#39;s presence was comforting, and she longed to confide in him. With a deep breath, she decided to take a leap of faith. She wiped away the remaining tears, took out the crumpled letter from behind her back, and held it up for Lucas to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m talking about this,&#34; she said, her voice trembling with a mix of curiosity and longing. &#34;You wrote this letter, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan, taken aback by the sudden revelation, felt a wave of coldness wash over him. His mind raced to find the right words, but his voice betrayed his nervousness as he scratched his short hair. &#34;Wha... What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa gazed at him intently, her eyes searching for the truth. She had stumbled upon his deepest feelings, and she needed to understand why he had never shared them with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You love me, don&#39;t you?&#34; she finally asked, her voice barely above a whisper. &#34;And you never bothered to tell me all this while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan&#39;s stammering continued as he struggled to find the right words to convey his emotions. &#34;Yes, and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Tessa stood there, holding the crumpled letter in her hand, she couldn&#39;t help but feel a mix of emotions swirling inside her. She had just confessed her realization to Lucas, and now the ball was in his court. The room seemed to grow quiet as they both exchanged glances, their unspoken words echoing in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas, clearly taken aback by Tessa&#39;s discovery, struggled to find his voice amidst the torrent of thoughts flooding his mind. He ran a hand through his hair, his eyes locked with Tessa&#39;s, searching for the right words to express himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I didn&#39;t expect you to find that letter,&#34; Lucas finally managed to say, his voice filled with a mix of vulnerability and sincerity. &#34;It&#39;s true, Tessa. I wrote that letter, pouring my heart out onto those pages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa felt her heart skip a beat as Lucas confirmed what she had suspected all along. The weight of his unspoken love suddenly became tangible, and she couldn&#39;t help but be moved by his heartfelt words. Yet, her heart was still filled with questions, uncertainties, and a longing for a deeper understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you send it to me, Lucas?&#34; Tessa asked softly, her voice laced with a hint of sadness. &#34;And when was this letter written? It feels like it holds so much more than just today&#39;s feelings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas took a deep breath, his eyes never leaving Tessa&#39;s gaze. He moved closer, sitting down beside her, his voice filled with remorse and honesty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to send it to you, Tessa, I really did,&#34; he confessed, his voice barely above a whisper. &#34;But I was afraid... Afraid of losing our friendship if my feelings weren&#39;t reciprocated. I couldn&#39;t bear the thought of you rejecting me, so I kept it hidden, locked within the pages of that book.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa listened intently, her heart aching for the fear and vulnerability Lucas had carried within him. She reached out and gently placed her hand on his, offering a comforting touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Lucas,&#34; Tessa whispered, her voice filled with a mixture of tenderness and understanding. &#34;I had no idea... The letter... It moved me deeply.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan mustered a fragile smile, his eyes reflecting a whirlwind of emotions. &#34;You... you read it?&#34; he asked softly, his heart hanging on her every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. &#34;Yes, Lucas, I read it. And I can&#39;t express how much it means to me that you would pour your heart out so vulnerably. Your words... they touched something deep within me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of relief washed over Tristan&#39;s weary soul, his vulnerability met with acceptance. He squeezed Tessa&#39;s hand gently, cherishing the connection they shared. &#34;Tessa, I&#39;ve loved you for so long, in silence. Every day, I&#39;ve admired your beauty, your kindness, and your laughter. You are the light that brightens my world, and I can no longer bear to keep my feelings hidden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Do you love me ?? asked lucas.</p>
