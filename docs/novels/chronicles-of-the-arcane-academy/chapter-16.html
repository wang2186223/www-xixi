                <p>The witch&#39;s eyes narrowed, a devious smirk curling her lips as she recognized Tessa. &#34;There she is, that little brat. I&#39;d like to teach her a small lesson,&#34; the witch muttered under her breath, her voice laced with malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to Tessa, the witch extended her hand and conjured a small, hard rock, sending it hurtling towards Tessa&#39;s path. Engrossed in her thoughts, Tessa continued her hurried pace, unaware of the impending danger. Just as the rock materialized in front of her, she stumbled upon it, losing her balance and on the verge of crashing to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment of peril, as if guided by fate, strong arms suddenly enveloped Tessa, preventing her from falling. Startled yet relieved, she found herself safely caught in the embrace of a stranger. Looking up, her eyes met the concerned gaze of the person who had come to her rescue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, are you okay?&#34; a deep, melodious voice filled with genuine concern reached Tessa&#39;s ears. The stranger&#39;s captivating eyes, a shade of warm amber, bore into hers, and a comforting aura surrounded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathless and slightly flustered, Tessa managed to gather herself and nodded. &#34;Yes, I am,&#34; she stammered, her cheeks flushed with a mixture of embarrassment and gratitude. &#34;Thanks for saving me. I owe you one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm smile tugged at the corners of the stranger&#39;s lips, and his eyes sparkled with amusement. &#34;No problem at all. I couldn&#39;t let a damsel in distress stumble and fall,&#34; he replied, his voice laced with a hint of playfulness. &#34;I&#39;m Jack, by the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s heart skipped a beat at the sound of his name. Jack. It suited him perfectly, she thought. She returned his smile, feeling an unexplainable connection growing between them. &#34;Tessa,&#34; she introduced herself, extending her hand towards him. &#34;Nice meeting you, Jack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s hand enveloped hers in a firm yet gentle grip, their fingers briefly intertwining. &#34;Likewise, Tessa,&#34; he replied, his warm smile widening. &#34;It&#39;s not every day I get to rescue a champion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft blush crept onto Tessa&#39;s cheeks as she remembered her victory at the competition. &#34;Oh, that was nothing,&#34; she modestly replied, her eyes gleaming with a mixture of pride and humility. &#34;It&#39;s just a small milestone on my magical journey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s gaze held a mixture of admiration and intrigue. &#34;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more to your story than meets the eye,&#34; he said, his voice filled with genuine curiosity. Tessa couldn&#39;t help but feel drawn to his attentiveness and the way he seemed genuinely interested in getting to know her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their conversation deepened, Tessa found herself opening up, sharing stories of her magical training, her dreams and aspirations, and even the challenges she had faced along her journey. Jack listened intently, his eyes never leaving hers, as if hanging onto her every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to stand still as they exchanged stories and discovered common interests. They laughed at shared jokes, and their conversation flowed effortlessly, as if they had known each other for much longer than mere minutes. Tessa felt a sense of comfort and ease with Jack, as if he were a missing piece she hadn&#39;t realized was absent until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But amidst the whirlwind of emotions and burgeoning connection, the urgent reality of her impending lecture resurfaced in Tessa&#39;s mind. &#34;Oh my God, my lecture! No way, Jack, I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she exclaimed, a mixture of disappointment and urgency in her voice. &#34;I have to rush for my class. Catch you later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s face reflected a mix of understanding and disappointment, but he nodded understandingly. &#34;Of course, Tessa. Your education is important. We&#39;ll catch up later,&#34; he said, his voice filled with sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hurried wave and a lingering glance, Tessa turned and sprinted off, her heart still fluttering from the encounter with Jack. Her footsteps echoed through the emptying corridors as she made her way to the lecture room. The anticipation and excitement of meeting Jack remained etched in her mind, fueling her steps and sending a renewed energy surging through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally reaching the lecture room, Tessa entered and quickly found a seat near the front, her mind still buzzing with thoughts of Jack. As she settled into her chair, attempting to regain her composure, the professor&#39;s voice rang out, signaling the start of the lecture. Tessa tried her best to focus, to immerse herself in the subject matter at hand, but her thoughts kept drifting back to Jack, his warm embrace, and the way he made her feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scribbled notes and participated in the discussions, but her mind felt divided between the lecture and the enchanting encounter with Jack. She couldn&#39;t help but wonder if their paths would cross again, and if the connection she felt was mutual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the lecture concluded, Tessa gathered her belongings and joined the stream of students exiting the classroom. She scanned the crowd, hoping to catch sight of Jack&#39;s familiar face amidst the bustling corridor. However, he was nowhere to be found, and a tinge of disappointment washed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even in the midst of that slight letdown, Tessa couldn&#39;t suppress the spark of hope that burned within her. She knew deep down that her encounter with Jack was more than just a chance meeting. There was a connection, an undeniable chemistry that she couldn&#39;t ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked through the academy&#39;s corridors, Tessa couldn&#39;t help but smile, her heart brimming with anticipation for their next meeting. She realized that in the vastness of the magical world and the academy&#39;s bustling halls, she had found someone who made her feel seen, understood,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>,,,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in her thoughts, Tessa wandered through the bustling corridors of the academy. The weight of recent events pressed upon her, making it difficult to fully engage with her surroundings. It was at this moment that she heard a familiar voice calling her name,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and she turned to find Lucas,  her closest friend, standing before her with a pained expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tessa, I&#39;ve been calling you for quite a while now. You didn&#39;t even check up on me, and now you&#39;re heading home. What&#39;s wrong? I thought we were friends,&#34; Lucas lamented, his voice tinged with hurt and confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s heart sank as she realized the impact her distraction had on Lucas. She reached out, taking his hand gently in hers, her eyes filled with regret. &#34;Lucas, I&#39;m so sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to neglect you. It&#39;s just... things have been complicated lately. Please understand,&#34; she pleaded, her voice filled with sincerity.</p>
