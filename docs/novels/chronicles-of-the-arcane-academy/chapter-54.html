                <p>As the lecturer marked the end of the class, the students began to gather their belongings, preparing to leave. Tessa turned to her newfound friend, Jane, a girl she had met recently during the lecture. They had quickly formed a bond, sharing laughter and insights throughout the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm smile, Tessa asked, &#34;Hey, what did you learn today? I&#39;m curious to hear your thoughts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane&#39;s eyes sparkled with enthusiasm as she replied, &#34;Well, I learned that the powers we possess are meant to be used for good. They give us an opportunity to make a positive impact and help others in need, if we can. It&#39;s such a wonderful responsibility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa nodded, impressed by Jane&#39;s perspective. &#34;Absolutely. It&#39;s essential to use our powers responsibly and for the betterment of others. I&#39;m glad we share the same belief.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane returned the smile and then turned the question back to Tessa. &#34;And what about you, Tessa? What did you learn today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa let out a small sigh, her expression momentarily troubled. &#34;To be honest, I wasn&#39;t fully focused during the lecture. My mind was elsewhere, dealing with some personal matters. I apologize if I seemed a bit distant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern flashed across Jane&#39;s face as she listened attentively. &#34;We&#39;re friends now, so you can confide in me. What&#39;s wrong? Maybe I can offer some support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s heart warmed at Jane&#39;s offer of friendship. She appreciated the genuine concern. &#34;Thank you, Jane. I truly appreciate that. But first, I realized we skipped a vital step. I don&#39;t even know your name yet. I apologize for the oversight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane blushed slightly, realizing their oversight as well. &#34;Oh, my apologies, Tessa. I&#39;m Jane. It&#39;s a pleasure to officially introduce myself. And yes, we should have done this earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa chuckled softly. &#34;No worries, Jane. Better late than never, right? I&#39;m Tessa. It&#39;s lovely to meet you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the introduction complete, Tessa took a moment to gather her thoughts. She appreciated Jane&#39;s offer of support and decided to open up about her concerns. However, before she could utter a word, her communicator rang, interrupting their conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s eyes widened in surprise as she glanced at the screen. &#34;Jane, I&#39;m so sorry. I have to take this call. It seems urgent,&#34; Tessa pleaded, stepping aside to answer it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane nodded understandingly. &#34;Of course, it&#39;s fine. Take your time,&#34; she replied, giving Tessa an assuring smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa picked up the call, her tone filled with worry. &#34;Hello, Lucas? What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the other end of the line was calm and familiar. &#34;Hey, Tessa. How are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, just nevermind,&#34; Tessa replied, her voice sounding slightly distracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas picked up on her unease and pressed further. &#34;Just what? Tessa, you don&#39;t sound alright. What&#39;s the problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa hesitated for a moment, torn between her desire to confide in Lucas and the urgent situation at hand. She finally made a decision. &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll tell you once we see each other, okay? I might come to your apartment today. Is that alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. I hope to see you soon. And please, send my regards to Tristan,&#34; Lucas said, his voice filled with genuine care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s concern for Tristan mirrored Lucas&#39;s sentiments. &#34;Absolutely. I&#39;ll make sure to pass along your message. Take care, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; Lucas assured her before ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa sighed, her mind still preoccupied with the conversation she had just had with Lucas. She couldn&#39;t shake off the worry that had settled within her. The urgency in his voice and his request to deliver regards to Tristan left her with a lingering sense of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she ended the call, Tessa turned her attention back to the classroom, only to find that Jane was nowhere to be seen. Confusion crossed her face as she wondered where her new friend had disappeared so quickly. Picking up her bag, she prepared to leave when suddenly, someone tapped her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reacting instinctively, Tessa swiftly turned around, her reflexes honed from years of training. She pushed the person away, causing them to stumble and crash into the wall. However, in that split second, Tessa&#39;s eyes widened as she realized that it was Jane she had accidentally knocked over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock and guilt flooded through her as she rushed to Jane&#39;s side, her words spilling out in a hurry. &#34;Oh my gosh, Jane! I&#39;m so sorry. I didn&#39;t know it was you. It startled me, and I reacted without thinking. I hope I didn&#39;t hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane, though momentarily surprised by the sudden shove, recovered quickly and let out a hearty laugh. &#34;It&#39;s fine, Tessa! I did it deliberately to see your reaction. But gosh, I didn&#39;t expect you to be so quick. You practically broke my fall more than anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Tessa as she realized that Jane was unhurt. She let out a nervous laugh, grateful that her unintentional push hadn&#39;t caused any harm. &#34;I&#39;m really sorry, Jane. You shouldn&#39;t have surprised me like that. I guess I let my reflexes take over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane grinned mischievously, brushing off the incident. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, Tessa. I&#39;m tough. Besides, I couldn&#39;t resist testing out your defense skills. You definitely have some impressive moves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s guilt eased further as Jane&#39;s playful energy filled the air. She realized that Jane was someone who knew how to take things lightly and find humor in unexpected situations. &#34;You certainly know how to keep me on my toes, Jane. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jane brushed off her clothes, still chuckling. &#34;No harm done, trust me. But I think I should head home now. See you some other time, dear Tessa. And remember, no need to apologize anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa waved goodbye, a mixture of relief and amusement coursing through her. &#34;Absolutely, Jane. Thanks for understanding. I&#39;ll see you soon. Take care!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jane left, Tessa couldn&#39;t help but reflect on the unique friendship they had formed. Jane&#39;s lighthearted nature and her ability to find humor in even the most unexpected situations were qualities that Tessa admired. She felt grateful to have met someone like Jane, who brought a sense of playfulness to her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a renewed sense of positivity, Tessa made her way out of the classroom, her earlier worries momentarily pushed aside. As she walked through the corridors, her thoughts turned back to the call from Lucas. She wondered what could have prompted such urgency, and the weight of concern settled upon her once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to exit the building, Tessa&#39;s communicator chimed once more, indicating an incoming call. Excitement and relief flooded her as she recognized the caller ID. It was Tristan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a radiant smile, she answered the call</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, my love,&#34; Tessa&#39;s voice echoed through the communicator, expecting to hear Tristan&#39;s familiar tone on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, instead of Tristan&#39;s voice, a different, more authoritative voice responded, &#34;Sorry, this isn&#39;t Tristan, although he is here. It&#39;s the leader of the Council of Elders.&#34;</p>
