                <p>chapter Fifty-Six</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa listened intently, absorbing the leader&#39;s words. The gravity of their mission settled upon her once more, and she felt a renewed determination to retrieve the stolen scrolls and restore balance to their world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader&#39;s gaze shifted to Jamie, acknowledging his presence. &#34;Jamie, your enchanted powers will serve as a valuable asset to this team. Your ability to sense and manipulate magic will aid us in tracking down the witches who have taken the scrolls. I have faith in your abilities, just as I have faith in all of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of camaraderie enveloped the team as they stood together, united in their purpose. They were a formidable force, strengthened by the purification rituals and the unique skills each member brought to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, sir,&#34; Tessa spoke, her voice filled with determination. &#34;We won&#39;t disappoint you. We will retrieve the stolen scrolls and ensure the safety of our academy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader nodded, his gaze filled with unwavering trust. &#34;I have no doubt that you will succeed, Tessa. Your resilience and dedication have already proven your capabilities. Remember, the fate of the academy and its teachings rests in your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words resonating in her mind, Tessa felt a surge of determination coursing through her veins. She turned to her team, meeting their determined gazes one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve come so far together, faced countless challenges, and triumphed over adversity,&#34; Tessa began, her voice steady and filled with conviction. &#34;Now, it&#39;s time for us to embark on this crucial mission as a united front. We will find the stolen scrolls, and we will bring them back to the academy where they belong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were met with resounding agreement and nods of determination. The team understood the significance of their task, the weight of responsibility that rested on their shoulders. But they also knew that together, they were stronger than any obstacle they might encounter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they prepared to set out on their mission, the leader of the Council of Elders approached Tessa once again, his expression a mix of pride and concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tessa, there is one more thing I must tell you,&#34; the leader said, his voice solemn. &#34;The group of witches who stole the scrolls is led by a powerful sorceress named Morgana. She wields dark magic and will stop at nothing to protect the scrolls and prevent their return to the academy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s eyes widened at the mention of Morgana. She had heard tales of the sorceress&#39;s malevolence and her insatiable thirst for power. The challenge ahead seemed even more daunting, but Tessa&#39;s resolve remained unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will face whatever dangers come our way, sir,&#34; Tessa replied firmly. &#34;Morgana may be powerful, but we have something she lacks: the strength of our unity and the belief in our cause.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader&#39;s eyes gleamed with admiration. &#34;Your words inspire confidence, Tessa. Always remember that true power lies not only in individual abilities but in the bonds we forge with those who stand by our side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those final words of wisdom, the leader stepped back, allowing Tessa and her team to meditate</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas spoke up, breaking the momentary silence. &#34;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s too early to embark on this mission? We just underwent the purification rituals, and we need time to understand the effects and the powers they have unlocked within us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan chimed in, supporting Lucas&#39;s concern. &#34;He&#39;s right. It&#39;s essential for us to comprehend the extent of our newfound abilities and how we can utilize them effectively. Rushing into the mission without fully understanding our powers could put us at a disadvantage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa contemplated their words, understanding the validity of their concerns. However, a sense of urgency nagged at her, compelling her to act swiftly. She believed that time was of the essence and that delaying the mission might give Morgana an opportunity to further her dark plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand your reservations, but I have this unshakeable feeling that we need to prepare for this mission as urgently as possible,&#34; Tessa expressed, her voice filled with conviction. &#34;We can take some time to familiarize ourselves with our newfound powers, but I don&#39;t think we have the luxury to wait for long. The longer we delay, the greater the risk to the academy and the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas and Tristan exchanged hesitant glances, contemplating Tessa&#39;s words. They understood her sense of urgency and acknowledged the potential consequences of delay. Reluctantly, they agreed to proceed with the mission, albeit with a condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Tessa,&#34; Lucas conceded, his voice reflecting a compromise. &#34;We will embark on this journey, but let&#39;s give ourselves at least a day to rest and fully understand the effects of the purification rituals. We need to be in the best shape possible for what lies ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa nodded in agreement, appreciating their compromise. &#34;Fair enough. We will reconvene tomorrow evening in the meeting room to finalize our plans and strategies for our encounter with Morgana. Use this time to rest, reflect, and unlock the potential within yourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie, who had been silently listening to the discussion, interjected with a note of enthusiasm. &#34;That won&#39;t be a problem. I can&#39;t wait to embark on this mission, even if it means going right now. The anticipation is fueling my eagerness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa smiled, impressed by Jamie&#39;s courage and determination. &#34;I admire your enthusiasm, Jamie. Your zeal to fight for the academy is commendable. We need more champions like you, not  babies, she said looking at Lucas and Tristain ,But let&#39;s take Lucas and Tristan&#39;s suggestion into consideration. We will meet tomorrow evening and ensure we are fully prepared for what awaits us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter filled the air as Tessa&#39;s words sank in. Jack, Tessa, and Jamie chuckled, lightening the tense atmosphere. However, Lucas and Tristan remained unconvinced, their expressions reflecting their concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t a laughing matter,&#34; Tristan remarked, his voice serious. &#34;We should approach this mission with caution and thorough preparation. Morgana is not to be underestimated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas added, his tone matching Tristan&#39;s seriousness, &#34;I agree. We need to be careful and make sure we have a solid plan in place. Our lives and the future of the academy depend on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s smile faded, replaced by a look of understanding. &#34;You&#39;re right, guys. I apologize if my earlier remark seemed insensitive. We need to strike a balance between urgency and caution. Let&#39;s use the time we have to rest, gather our strength, and devise a comprehensive strategy. Tomorrow, we will reconvene with a clear and focused mindset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their concerns addressed, the team dispersed, going their separate ways. Jamie bid them goodbye, eager to prepare himself mentally for the challenges ahead. Jack left, assuring them he would see them at the meeting tomorrow.</p>
