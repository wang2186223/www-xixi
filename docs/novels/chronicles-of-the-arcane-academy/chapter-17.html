                <p>Lucas sighed, his features softening as he recognized the sincerity in Tessa&#39;s eyes. &#34;I know, Tessa. It&#39;s just... sometimes it feels like you&#39;re slipping away, and it scares me,&#34; he admitted, vulnerability seeping into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s grip on his hand tightened, her voice filled with reassurance. &#34;I&#39;m here, Lucas. I value our friendship more than anything. I promise I&#39;ll make an effort to be more present,&#34; she vowed, her words carrying the weight of her commitment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of a smile tugged at the corners of Lucas&#39; lips, and he nodded appreciatively. &#34;Thank you, Tessa. That means a lot to me,&#34; he said, a sense of relief evident in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s eyes sparkled with determination as she looked at Lucas. &#34;Actually, there&#39;s something important I need to do. I was wondering if you could come with me,&#34; she suggested, hoping to strengthen their bond and alleviate any lingering doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas&#39;s curiosity was piqued, and he nodded, his trust in Tessa evident. &#34;Of course, I&#39;ll go with you. Just tell me where we&#39;re headed,&#34; he replied, his voice filled with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa took a deep breath, preparing herself to share the truth. &#34;I need to visit Tristan. Something happened yesterday that left me shaken, and I think seeing him will help me find some clarity,&#34; she confessed, her voice tinged with a mix of vulnerability and determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern etched itself onto Lucas&#39; face as he heard the name Tristan. &#34;What happened to him? Is he okay?&#34; he asked, his voice laced with genuine worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa took a moment to gather her thoughts, knowing that recounting the events would be difficult. &#34;When Tristan accompanied me to my apartment, we were unexpectedly ambushed by intruders. We had to flee for our safety,&#34; she explained, her voice faltering slightly as the memories resurfaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas gasped, his eyes widening with shock. &#34;My goodness, Tessa! Are you alright? Where did you stay last night?&#34; he asked, his concern overflowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa hesitated for a moment, her gaze shifting to the ground. &#34;I stayed at Tristan&#39;s place,&#34; she confessed, her voice barely above a whisper, bracing herself for Lucas&#39; reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mix of emotions flickered across Lucas&#39; face, a storm of jealousy, worry, and fear battling within him. He struggled to maintain his composure, quickly wiping away a stray tear that escaped his eye, not wanting to reveal his vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s heart ached as she witnessed Lucas&#39; internal struggle. She reached out to him, her touch gentle and comforting. &#34;Lucas, what&#39;s happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas sighed, his emotions bubbling beneath the surface. He managed a weak smile, attempting to hide the turmoil within him. &#34;It&#39;s nothing, Tessa. I think something just got into my eyes,&#34; he replied, his voice tinged with a mixture of sadness and longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa studied Lucas&#39; face, her concern deepening. She could sense that there was more to his reaction than mere irritation. She wanted to offer him support, to lend a listening ear and a comforting presence, but she also understood the complexity of their friendship and the unspoken feelings that lingered between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you ever want to talk about anything, Lucas, know that I&#39;m here for you,&#34; she reassured him, her voice filled with warmth and sincerity. She gently squeezed his hand, silently conveying her support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas nodded appreciatively, grateful for Tessa&#39;s understanding. &#34;Thank you, Tessa. I appreciate your friendship more than you know,&#34; he admitted, a glimmer of gratitude shining in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stood there, their hands intertwined, Tessa felt a sense of connection and trust between them. They had shared countless moments, both joyful and challenging, and she valued the bond they had formed. Despite the confusion and complexity of their emotions, she hoped they could navigate through it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Tessa was about to speak again, Lucas interrupted, his tone slightly abrupt. &#34;Don&#39;t you think we should get going? Tristan is waiting, after all,&#34; he suggested, trying to redirect their attention and shift the focus away from his own emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa nodded, understanding Lucas&#39; need for a change of subject. She appreciated his attempt to protect himself and maintain a sense of normalcy amidst the whirlwind of emotions. &#34;You&#39;re right, Lucas. Let&#39;s head to Tristan&#39;s place,&#34; she agreed, a gentle smile gracing her lips as she intertwined her arm with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked side by side, their footsteps echoing through the academy&#39;s corridors, Tessa&#39;s mind raced with thoughts and questions. She couldn&#39;t deny the growing connection she felt with Lucas, nor could she ignore the newfound vulnerability that had surfaced between them. The events of the past day had stirred something within her, a yearning for deeper understanding and exploration of their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching Tristan&#39;s place, they stood outside the door, their hands still intertwined. Tessa took a deep breath, her heart pounding with anticipation and uncertainty. She turned to Lucas, her eyes meeting his, and spoke softly, &#34;Lucas, I know things have been complicated lately. But I want you to know that you mean so much to me. Our friendship is special, and I don&#39;t want to lose that. Can we take some time to talk, to be honest with each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas looked at Tessa, his eyes filled with a mixture of apprehension and longing. He nodded slowly, a flicker of hope illuminating his expression. &#34;I&#39;ve wanted that too, Tessa. Let&#39;s take the time we need. I value our friendship more than anything,&#34; he confessed, his voice laced with sincerity.</p>
