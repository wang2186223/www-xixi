                <p>chapter Nineteen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they arrived at the restaurant, they were greeted by the sight of a newly built establishment. Its elegant architecture and enchanting ambiance captivated their attention, making them marvel at its beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, this place looks absolutely beautiful,&#34; Lucas exclaimed, his eyes scanning the surroundings in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa nodded in agreement, her gaze taking in the magical atmosphere. &#34;It&#39;s incredible to think that this entire place was built using magic. The attention to detail is mind-blowing,&#34; she remarked, unable to contain her admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their initial fascination subsiding, the trio made their way inside, eager to find a suitable table. However, as they entered the main dining area, a debate ensued over where to sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we should take that table over there,&#34; Tristan suggested, pointing towards a secluded table in the far corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas disagreed, pointing at a table on the opposite end of the room. &#34;No, I think this one would be better. It has a better view,&#34; he argued, his competitive nature coming to the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa, growing increasingly frustrated by their bickering, interrupted their dispute. &#34;Guys, please, let&#39;s not create a scene here. We came to enjoy a meal, not argue about seating arrangements,&#34; she pleaded, her voice filled with exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas turned to Tessa, a hint of annoyance in his tone. &#34;Tessa, you always side with Tristan. Can&#39;t you understand my point of view?&#34; he retorted, feeling a pang of frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa sighed, feeling torn between her friends. &#34;Lucas, we&#39;re going with Tristan&#39;s suggestion because he&#39;s the one treating us tonight. Please try to understand,&#34; she explained, hoping to diffuse the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas relented, realizing the logic behind Tessa&#39;s words. &#34;Fine, let&#39;s go with Tristan&#39;s choice,&#34; he conceded, albeit reluctantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they settled into their chosen table, a waiter approached them with a warm smile. &#34;Good day, ladies and gentlemen. What would you like to order?&#34; he asked, ready to take their requests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas eagerly spoke up, his excitement palpable. &#34;I&#39;ll have the Donut and Seal with a side of vegetables, please,&#34; he ordered confidently, causing both Tristan and Tessa to raise their eyebrows in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan leaned in to whisper to Tessa, &#34;Tonut and Seali is a supernatural dish known for its effects. It tends to make you feel a bit high, similar to the effect of alcohol in the human world,&#34; he explained, chuckling softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa nodded, a mixture of curiosity and amusement on her face. &#34;Alright, then. I guess I&#39;ll order after you,&#34; she replied, deciding to give it a try as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan turned to the waiter. &#34;I&#39;ll have the same as hers,&#34; he said, gesturing towards Tessa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter jotted down their orders and soon returned with their food. As they began eating, a light-hearted atmosphere settled over the table. Lucas, known for his voracious appetite, dove into his meal with gusto, unaware of the amused glances exchanged between Tristan and Tessa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dude, take it easy on the food,&#34; Tristan teased, watching Lucas devour his meal with unparalleled enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa couldn&#39;t help but burst into laughter. &#34;I don&#39;t understand how someone can be so passionate about food,&#34; she remarked, her eyes sparkling with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The playful banter continued as they enjoyed their meal, creating an atmosphere of camaraderie and joy. However, in the midst of their laughter and conversation, a food mishap occurred. In his haste to savor every bite, Lucas accidentally spilled a portion of his dish, causing it to land on his lap, resulting in a humorous and somewhat messy situation. Sauce splattered on Lucas&#39;s pants, and a piece of vegetable found its way onto his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan and Tessa erupted into laughter, unable to contain their amusement at the sight of their friend covered in food. Lucas, initially taken aback, couldn&#39;t help but join in the laughter. He wiped the sauce off his clothes with a napkin, his face turning slightly red from both embarrassment and laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, Lucas, I guess your enthusiasm got the best of you,&#34; Tristan chuckled, trying to stifle his laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa, still giggling, added, &#34;I told you to take it easy on the food, but I didn&#39;t expect you to wear it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas laughed sheepishly, realizing the comical nature of the situation. &#34;I guess I got a little carried away. At least it adds some flavor to my outfit,&#34; he quipped, playfully gesturing to the food stains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the laughter subsided, they resumed their meal, albeit with a lighter and more relaxed atmosphere. The incident had brought them even closer, bonding them through shared laughter and camaraderie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the rest of their time at the restaurant, they engaged in lively conversation, sharing stories, and exchanging jokes. The delicious food and enchanting atmosphere of the restaurant served as the backdrop for a memorable evening together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they finished their meal and prepared to leave the restaurant, Tristan called the waiter to settle the bill. Tessa interjected with a mischievous smile on her face. &#34;You know what, Tristan? Since Lucas here provided the entertainment, I think it&#39;s only fair that he pays for his own dry cleaning,&#34; she teased, causing all three of them to burst into laughter once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas playfully rolled his eyes, knowing that he couldn&#39;t escape the consequences of his food mishap. &#34;Fine, fine. I&#39;ll take care of it,&#34; he conceded, laughing along with his friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their laughter echoed through the restaurant, creating an air of joy and friendship. However, just as they were about to leave, the restaurant suddenly experienced a power outage, or perhaps a technical glitch, plunging the establishment into darkness. The sudden shift from light to darkness startled them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Tessa asked, her grip on Tristan&#39;s hand tightening with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tristan, always calm in such situations, reassured her. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Tessa. It&#39;s probably just a temporary power outage. Let me find a way to get some light.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fumbled around in his pockets, searching for his phone, and then realized that he had left it at home. &#34;I must have forgotten my phone,&#34; he said, a hint of frustration in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucas, always prepared, pulled out his phone and turned on the flashlight. Its beam illuminated the immediate area around them, casting eerie shadows on the walls.</p>
