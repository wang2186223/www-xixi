                <p>chapter Fifty-one</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Tessa hurriedly made her way through the bustling hallways towards the lecture room, she felt a sense of unease. The ticking clock on her wrist served as a constant reminder that time was slipping away. She knew she was running late for her class and she couldn&#39;t afford to miss any more lectures. Determined to find a seat, she quickened her pace, hoping to blend in unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a burst of urgency, Tessa pushed open the door to the lecture room and quietly slipped inside. The room was already abuzz with students settling into their seats, their attention directed towards the front where the lecturer stood. Tessa&#39;s eyes darted around, searching for an empty chair. Spotting one towards the middle, she decided to make a beeline for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, just as she passed the lecturer, who was engrossed in explaining the day&#39;s topic, his gaze suddenly locked onto her. The room fell silent as all eyes turned towards Tessa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you!&#34; the lecturer&#39;s voice boomed, his stern gaze fixed upon her. &#34;Who are you, and why are you late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa felt a pang of anxiety tighten her chest. She hesitated for a moment, then gathered her courage and replied, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, sir. My name is Tessa. I was in a meeting with the council of elders, discussing matters of great importance. That&#39;s why I&#39;m late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers erupted among the students as they exchanged surprised glances. One voice rang out, breaking through the murmurs. &#34;She&#39;s the leader of the Academy Champions!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lecturer&#39;s expression softened slightly as he glanced at Tessa. &#34;Are you the champion?&#34; he inquired, a hint of curiosity lacing his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa nodded, her voice filled with a mix of humility and pride. &#34;Yes, sir. I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of recognition sparked in the lecturer&#39;s eyes. He quickly recovered from his initial sternness and smiled warmly. &#34;Oh, I&#39;m really sorry for the interruption, Tessa. Please go ahead and take your seat. It&#39;s an honor to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a blend of relief and gratitude, Tessa thanked the lecturer and headed towards the seat she had spotted earlier. As she settled down, she stole a quick glance at the students around her. That&#39;s when she noticed the young woman sitting next to her, her features strikingly familiar. There was something about her that tugged at Tessa&#39;s memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to resist her curiosity, Tessa leaned slightly towards the girl and spoke in a friendly, soft tone. &#34;Hello, greetings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl turned her head and offered a small smile. &#34;Hey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa studied her face intently, trying to unravel the enigma. &#34;I&#39;ve been thinking, have we met before? You look strangely familiar to me. Have our paths crossed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl paused, her brow furrowing in contemplation. After a moment, she shook her head. &#34;I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m pretty good with faces, and I&#39;m sure I would remember meeting someone like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s mind raced, desperately searching for any connection between them. She couldn&#39;t shake off the nagging feeling that they had indeed crossed paths. Determined to find answers, she mustered up her courage and gently reached out to touch the girl&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as soon as Tessa&#39;s fingertips made contact, an unforeseen and alarming phenomenon occurred. The girl&#39;s body erupted in flickering flames, as if a dormant fire had been ignited within her. Her eyes blazed with an intense fury, and she recoiled, screaming, &#34;Hey, stay away from me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden outburst caused the entire room to freeze in shock. The lecturer quickly regained his composure, his eyes widening in concern. He pointed towards their direction, his voice laced with urgency. &#34;What&#39;s going on over there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s heart pounded in her chest as she withdrew her hand, shock and confusion etched across her face. The girl&#39;s flaming form gradually subsided, leaving behind a faint trail of smoke that dissipated into the air. Tessa&#39;s mind raced, trying to comprehend the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing, sir,&#34; Tessa stammered, her voice trembling with a mixture of fear and reassurance. &#34;Just a small... misunderstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lecturer&#39;s gaze lingered on them for a moment longer, his brows furrowed with suspicion. Sensing the tension in the room, he decided to let the matter go, albeit reluctantly. &#34;Alright, but please be careful,&#34; he cautioned before turning his attention back to the lecture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the whispers and murmurs gradually faded, Tessa turned towards the girl, her eyes filled with concern. &#34;I... I&#39;m so sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to cause you any harm or distress. I don&#39;t understand what just happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl took a deep breath, her fiery demeanor gradually subsiding as she regained control. Her voice held a mixture of frustration and vulnerability. &#34;It&#39;s not your fault. You see... I possess the ability to manipulate fire. It&#39;s a part of me, but it&#39;s also unpredictable and difficult to control. Your touch must have triggered an intense surge of anger within me, igniting my powers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa listened attentively, her curiosity piqued. She had encountered individuals with unique abilities before, but the girl&#39;s power over fire fascinated her. She leaned closer, speaking softly. &#34;That&#39;s... incredible. And undoubtedly challenging. How do you manage to keep it hidden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl&#39;s expression softened, a hint of sadness in her eyes. &#34;For most of my life, I&#39;ve tried to suppress it, to blend in with normalcy. It&#39;s isolating, but I thought it was for the best. That&#39;s probably why you find me familiar-I&#39;ve been here in this very class, keeping my secret hidden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s eyes widened in realization. The familiarity she felt wasn&#39;t a result of their paths crossing in the past, but rather an intuition born from a shared struggle. She placed a hand gently on the girl&#39;s arm, offering comfort and understanding. &#34;You don&#39;t have to face this alone. I am among the  Academy Champions, individuals with extraordinary abilities like yours. We support each other, learn from one another. Maybe... we can help you embrace your powers and find a way to control them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimmer of hope sparkled in the girl&#39;s eyes, blending with a flicker of apprehension. &#34;You&#39;d do that? Even after what just happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa nodded with determination, a warm smile gracing her face. &#34;Of course. We&#39;re a team, a family. We understand the challenges and the potential within these extraordinary abilities. You don&#39;t have to hide anymore. We&#39;ll guide you and help you discover your true potential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl&#39;s lips curved into a hesitant smile, a mix of gratitude and excitement lighting up her features. &#34;Thank you. I&#39;ve been searching for acceptance and guidance for so long. I&#39;m ready to embrace who I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s heart swelled with joy as a sense of purpose enveloped her. She knew this encounter wasn&#39;t a mere coincidence. Fate had brought them together, and now their journey would intertwine, leading them towards a future of discovery, growth, and the realization of their true potential as champions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back in their seats, the two fellows turned their attention back to the lecture</p>
