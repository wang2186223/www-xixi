                <p>The attack and everything we witnessed ys in my mind repeatedly; the ground crowded with my brothers&#39;&#39; bodies, the funeral pyre Lucas, Eli and I built, the dread once I realized the beast wasing for us too. We fought with everything we had, but we couldn&#39;&#39;t even see our enemy; once it had me in its maw, I knew it was the end for me. Strangely however, right now all I feel is peace; I feel weightless. Is this limbo? Am I dead? I must be because I have never felt so good in my life. Every worry I ever harbored, every insecurity and every ounce of pain, simply gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel like I&#39;&#39;m floating but there is this strange warmth about the ce where I&#39;&#39;m at right now. I really hope I&#39;&#39;m dead so I get to stay in this warmth forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, though, I feel a tingling sensation on my forehead and it spreads throughout my body. It intensifies the warmth and I fight to open my eyes to see where this ising from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyelids feel heavy, like it&#39;&#39;s an impossible task to open them but I&#39;&#39;m determined to find the source. As the fog of my mind clears even further, I realize it&#39;&#39;s not just tingling, it&#39;&#39;s downright electricitying from my forehead. It jolts me awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I see and feel is even better than my limbo. It&#39;&#39;s an angel, my angel. Her beautiful face is looking at me with concern and I realize it&#39;&#39;s her hand on my forehead that caused my awakening. Her straight, ck hair frames her face as she regards me, she has the most seductive full lips I have ever seen, and her eyes... her eyes are the most beautiful shade of green I have ever seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My beaten and dying lycan is also awake, and we&#39;&#39;re both staring at her. He doesn&#39;&#39;t need to tell me, I already know, &#34;Mate...&#34; It is barely a whisper and shees closer to me to make sense out of what I just said. Does she not feel it too? &#34;Mate...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, the fog and darkness ims me again.N?velDrama.Org ? content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again I feel the fog lifting and I know she is close; I can feel her. I fight to open my eyes to find her; I need to see for myself that I didn&#39;&#39;t dream her. Before I canpletely wake up, the first thing I perceive is her smell. So she&#39;&#39;s a wolf, and she smells like vani and honey, but... there&#39;&#39;s another smell to her I can&#39;&#39;t quite ce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes finally open, and she&#39;&#39;s even more stunning than I remembered. I&#39;&#39;m apparently at some sort of hospital and she&#39;&#39;s writing down notes while looking at the machines hooked to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more I look at her, the faster my heart beats. She frowns and looks over to me as the machine starts beeping faster. Her eyes finallynd on mine and I can feel myself smiling like an idiot. I don&#39;&#39;t know if it&#39;&#39;s because I&#39;&#39;m high on my mate&#39;&#39;s smell or high on drugs. I attempt to speak, I want to ask her name but my throat feels as if I&#39;&#39;ve eaten sand. She brings a ss of water to my lips and I drink. My lycan stirs awake too, which surprises me because of how banged up we are. I guess he&#39;&#39;s also excited about meeting his mate but strangely, we can&#39;&#39;t fully sense her wolf; it&#39;&#39;s like she&#39;&#39;s hidden somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;&#39;s looking at me intently, her eyes unwavering and suddenly I forget what I was going to say in the first ce. I take her hand to my chest and ce my hand on top of hers. She lifts her hand to my cheek and all doubts dissipate; It&#39;&#39;s very clear to me that we both feel this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew I couldn&#39;&#39;t have dreamt someone as perfect as you.&#34; I tell her, although this was more of an internal thought I unconsciously say out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I vaguely notice the lights turned on. She turns her head to the door, breaking our connection and I take the opportunity to keep admiring her. Her skin is fair and smooth and her eyes are of a color I have never seen before, so light they could look white under certain lighting. Her straight hair is cut to her shoulders and it looks thick, I can&#39;&#39;t wait to wrap my hand around it and -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this a new way of checking his temperature, doc.&#34; My train of thought is interrupted by none other than Eli&#39;&#39;s grumpy a*s; I feel guilty I hadn&#39;&#39;t thought about asking about them. He called her &#39;&#39;doc&#39;&#39; and I realize,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;&#39;re the one who saved me, huh?&#34; I tell her. My hand instinctively goes up to hers, keeping her here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I merely operated on you, from what I hear, your friends here carried you all the way to the clinic from goddess knows where.&#34; Now I turn to look at both Eli and Lucas and it grounds me to our reality. We were attacked and nearly killed, and we don&#39;&#39;t even know by what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;&#39;t be so humble, doc! We might have carried him but when we got here, he was basically dead. You brought him back to us. Literally.&#34; Lucas tells her with a big smile; he&#39;&#39;s like a little brother to me but if he smiles at her any longer, I&#39;&#39;m breaking his other arm. &#34;I think it&#39;&#39;s getting prettyte, isn&#39;&#39;t there somewhere you have to be?&#34; Eli clearly doesn&#39;&#39;t like her and I&#39;&#39;m not surprised, but if he continues to look at her like that, I&#39;&#39;m also going to have to break his other arm. I&#39;&#39;m about to growl at them to back off, but my angel speaks to me first,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;ll be back tomorrow morning, for now try to get some rest.&#34; Rest?! How can I get any rest knowing she&#39;&#39;s not in bed with me!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? No! I&#39;&#39;ming with you!&#34; I tell her, panic settles into me at the thought of her leaving, but also at the thought of whatever attacked using here and me not being able to protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to rest and I need to go to our Alpha, she&#39;&#39;s called me into her office. I&#39;&#39;ll be back tomorrow morning, I promise.&#34; She steps out of the room and all I want to do is follow her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck, Noah?!&#34; Eli is angry enough to dare yell at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean &#39;&#39;what the f**k&#39;&#39; she&#39;&#39;s my mate.&#34; I tell him very calmly, knowing damn well how much this is going to irritate him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WHAT!?&#34; His scream could&#39;&#39;ve awoken the entire ce and his face was getting redder by the second, but anyint he might have would fall on deaf ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already mine.</p>
