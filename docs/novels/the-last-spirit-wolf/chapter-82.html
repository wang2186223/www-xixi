                <p>It takes me a moment to realize that I have been attacked. As I try to get up, a sharp pain in my mid body stops me; I&#39;&#39;m fairly certain I broke a rib and my arm instinctively wraps around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a look back at the witch to see what exactly happened and realize it was Alistair who came to her aid. Our warriors are still fighting their soldiers which is why nobody noticed when Alistair slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Noah separate from the group to go after Alistair before noticing that I&#39;&#39;m not there. He stops mid step and turns his head around frantically looking for me. When his eyesnd on me, on the ground, and the tree I crashed against, he snarls and goes after Alistair full force, tackling him to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They begin fighting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah is slightly taller than Alistair and by far the better warrior, but Alistair is still the son of a beta; he might prove to be a more challenging enemy than we initially anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few momentster, I feel the healing abilities I got from Noah start to work their magic. The pain is decreasing, enough to let me stand and make my way to the witch. With Alistair entertained, I just might be able to kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a step forward and lock eyes with the witch, she was only temporarily entertained by the sight of Noahing for Alistair, but her main focus all this time has been me. She has unnerving milky white eyes and they are following my every move now. I scan my surroundings looking for my spear which wasunched in the air with me. I need it to finally kill her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spot the spear in between the witch and I, but she follows my gaze and realizes what my intentions are. We both start running towards it, her dropping her artifacts to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach it first and pick it up but before she can stop herself froming closer to me, I use it to sh a clean cut across her cheek, bright red blood dripping from the wound. I smile to myself. Gotcha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stops for a moment, touching the cut with her fingertips and then looking at them covered in fresh blood. She frowns, looking back between the spear and her fingers in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she screeches; her mouth opening wide in the most unnatural way. It is a loud, horrible sound thatpels me to cover my ears; it sounds like nails being drawn to a chalkboard, only worse. The rest of the people nearby do the same, some even falling to their knees as they cover their ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she&#39;&#39;s done, I barely have time to react as sheunches herself towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her movements are quick but there&#39;&#39;s something soft about the way she moves, something almost ethereal. She has long hair, it almost touches the ground, and horribly long, w like nails. I had a feeling this was the same woman I saw in my vision before from when Alistair was young, but now I have confirmed it. So, he has been involved with this witch for a very long time now. It raises many theories in my head, but I can&#39;&#39;t stop to ponder on them now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I use my spear to stop several of her attacks; I have a feeling those nails can do as much damage as any weapon. She stops chasing and attacking me after only a few minutes when she realizes she can&#39;&#39;t get to me this way. Then, she begins chanting something and my ears begin to ring; she&#39;&#39;s trying to use magic against me as I recognize the samenguage my father was using at Jade Waterfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she&#39;&#39;s done, she points her fingers at me and the ringing in my ear stops. She has a nasty grin on her face that quickly dissipates as whatever macabre n she had for me does note to fruition. She tries again and again, chanting in that familiarnguage, but nothing happens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She growls in frustration,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This is the first time I hear her voice and it&#39;&#39;s surprisingly very pleasant. It sounds soft and delicate, much like what she presents herself as; but I know better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tired of her antics, Iunch myself forward. It&#39;&#39;s a great relief to know that her spells won&#39;&#39;t work against me; it&#39;&#39;s the only thing that worried me about facing her since I still can&#39;&#39;t really use my magic. She steps aside again and again as I attack, almost as if reading my moves. If Iunch the spear forward, she knows to step back, if I stab to a side, she knows to step to the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I&#39;&#39;m incredibly fast, she is too, and she knows it. At this rate, it&#39;&#39;s really a matter of who gets tired first, or who gets reinforcements first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I start looking around to see if anyone is avable to help me, but the warriors that came with us are still fighting off the soldiers which outnumbered us, and Noah is still entertained with Alistair. I&#39;&#39;ll have to keep her like this until someone cane in and distract her so that I can put my spear through her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to me, while I was busy trying to think of a strategy and looking around, the witch hase close to me andunched her ws forward, getting me right on my stomach. The sting of the cut is painful, but I also take advantage of the proximity to again sh at her, this time getting her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both separate, her checking on her wound. It&#39;&#39;s a deep cut and she has to keep her hand on it to avoid losing too much blood. Quickly, I take a look at mine. She has shed through my clothes and the wound is deep, but my healing kicks in and it&#39;&#39;s already closing as I step forward to try and get her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsurprisingly, she dodges my attacks but her movements are noticeably slower. She&#39;&#39;s getting tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, finally, I see Noah behind her put Alistair on the ground. He&#39;&#39;s unresponsive from what I can tell at this distance, but I&#39;&#39;m not sure he&#39;&#39;s dead yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah, who has noticed my struggle to kill that witch, ising up from behind her and tries to tackle her but his footsteps are too heavy and she hears himing. She dodges him with ease. Hees to stand next to me as the witch starts moving, circling us. There&#39;&#39;s a change in her expression that I can&#39;&#39;t quite understand. She looks... triumphant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step forward with the intent of attacking her again, but something stops me in my tracks; she&#39;&#39;s whispering something. I can&#39;&#39;t quite understand what it is, it&#39;&#39;s unlike the spell from before. though. But then I also notice...she&#39;&#39;s looking straight at Noah. Oh no.This belongs to N?velDrama.Org - ?.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to look at him,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah!&#34; I yell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;&#39;s unresponsive. His eyes are following the witch&#39;&#39;s every move, his body rxing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah!&#34; I yell again,ing closer to him and nudging his massive arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my horror, his eyes begin to ze over.</p>
