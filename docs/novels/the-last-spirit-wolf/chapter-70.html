                <p>The next morninges along faster than I&#39;&#39;d like. I turn around and extend my arm to the other side of the bed, searching for Noah but I hear the shower running; he&#39;&#39;s already getting ready. I yawn and stretch, getting up to join him in the shower. When Ie in, he has his eyes closed, letting the water stream down on his head. I take a minute to admire the physique on this man; his toned abs, legs and arms look absolutely delicious; and then, I let my gaze linger one of my favorite parts hanging between his legs. &#34;See anything you like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;&#39;s staring at me, catching me shamelessly ogling him. I blush, but still step into the shower with him. I take the rag and soap, soaping up his back. When I&#39;&#39;m done, he returns the favor, washing my entire body before we have to go out and face our new reality. &#34;Did you get any sleepst night?&#34; I ask him as we towel ourselves dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Barely,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We continue getting ready. We&#39;&#39;re in casual clothes; jeans and a t-shirt. Before we&#39;&#39;repletely done, Eli is knocking at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah goes to let him in as I grab my spear and hang it on my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning your Royal Highnesses,&#34; he smiles, sarcastically, &#34;we have a busy day ahead of us so I suggest you keep up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turns around and begins walking. Noah gives me a look and we both follow behind him. It&#39;&#39;s around 5:00 AM and most of the people are still asleep. &#34;First thing&#39;&#39;s first, we have to meet with the Council andy down the new rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which are?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it&#39;&#39;s quite simple,&#34; he says as he opens the door to the Council meeting room, &#34;either they ept Noah as the new King or they get decapitated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;&#39;s smiling as he opens the doors wide and we step in, no doubt picturing the decapitation of one these poor souls; a chill runs down my spine. The Council is already sitting around the grand table, leaving only one spot at the head designated for the King. None of them stand as Noah takes the empty seat, followed closely behind by myself and Eli. Once he sits, he looks back up at me as I stand beside him. I smile at him, letting him know this is fine; I don&#39;&#39;t mind standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gentlemen,&#34; Eli speaks, &#34;your new King doesn&#39;&#39;t need any introduction, of course, but from now on you shall address him as His Highness, His Royal Highness, or King. Is that clear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the Council members stands up angrily, his seat scooting back and falling and his face bright red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will NEVER be King. *Warrior* Noah, you hear me?! What you did was a disgrace! We have ways, we have protocol, and you just shitted on all of it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suggest you sit down, Council member, or this will be a shorter meeting than I intend it to be,&#34; Noah says. His voice is thick, clearly indicating that his lycan is just below the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Council member does not sit down and instead looks at Noah disdainfully. He huffs and angrily begins walking to the exit. Eli looks at me and nods in the direction of the door. In a moment, I unsheathe my spear and throw it to intercept the Council member. It incrusts itself on the wood, only a few inches away from the Council member&#39;&#39;s head. He stops cold in his tracks, his face looking rather pale as he stares at his reflection on the metal of the weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;|</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suggest you listen to your King. Council member.&#34; I say a little too sweetly. &#34;I didn&#39;&#39;t get much sleepst night, I might miss next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see the adam&#39;&#39;s apple on the council member&#39;&#39;s neck bob up and down. He slowly steps away from where he was almost impaled by my spear and moves back to his seat, picking up the chair and sitting on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First order of business, I&#39;&#39;m not going to force anyone to support me as King, you can leave* after you&#39;&#39;ve heard what I have to say and then decide if this is something you want to be a part of or not. We did not do what we did on impulse, and if there would&#39;&#39;ve been any other solution, we would&#39;&#39;ve taken it, but there wasn&#39;&#39;t. It shouldn&#39;&#39;t be a secret to you how much Alistair was despised in this castle; how many warriors, healers, and schrs deserted after he became King. it is also no secret to *any* of you &#34;how he became King.&#34; he makes a point to look directly at the Council member that spoke earlier, &#34;but now, all of that changes. If there is any legitimate im to the throne, it will be evaluated fairly, honestly, and with the well-being of *all* lycans taken into ount.&#34; Eli looks at him sideways but gives nothing away. I know he&#39;&#39;s confused by what Noah just said but we can&#39;&#39;t tell him anything, not yet. Noah continues,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will be looking at the financial situation of the entire kingdom over the next couple of days. There have been some troubling reports from beyond the castle that evidence just how mismanaged it has been. There is a shortage of crops being reported from the east and attacks by rogues from the south. Any idea what King Alistair was doing about all of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Council members remain quiet for a moment, looking at each other. One brave voice speaks,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm, if I may?&#34; Council member William says as he stands, &#34;a party of ten was sent to the south to deal with the rogues a month ago, we never heard back from them. In regards to the crop shortage, we didn&#39;&#39;t... we didn&#39;&#39;t do anything... King - Alistair didn&#39;&#39;t think they were being truthful, merely trying to avoid their taxes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stare at him in disbelief and Noah runs his hand through his face in annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;&#39;ve got to be kidding me. Ten warriors to deal with a rogue invasion to one of our most crucial territories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah sighs,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok. What else should I know about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting proceeds for many hours more. Eventually, I get tired of standing and retreat to one of the chairs at the back designated for guards. Eli joins me eventually,pletely satisfied with how Noah is handling the meeting. &#34;Would you look at that, the kid is a natural; it&#39;&#39;s like he was born for this,&#34; he whispers to me.Content ? provided by N?velDrama.Org.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I simply smile. If only he knew just how right he might be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think they&#39;&#39;llply? I&#39;&#39;m afraid we have a couple of wolves dressed as sheep amongst us.&#34; I point out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Certainly, but they&#39;&#39;ll be revealed in time. Noah has the support of his warriors and soon will have the support of all the kingdom, I have no doubt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I admire your positivity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean to tell me you don&#39;&#39;t think he can do it?&#34; He raises an eyebrow at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean to say, Alistair is still out there up to Goddess knows what. Before dealing with all of this, we should be hunting him down to the ends of the earth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And we will, we have warriors scouting for him as we speak, it&#39;&#39;s only a matter of time before he shows up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire table stands, including Noah, and we stand with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will meet again after lunch. Again, if you are not on board with my proposals, I suggest you don&#39;&#39;t return. If you don&#39;&#39;t return, you will be given 48 hours to get your affairs in order, pack up your stuff, and get the hell out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of Council members nod and take their leave, others are left whispering amongst themselves off to a corner, taking turns to throw scornful looks our way. I retreat my spear from the door frame and make sure to look at them as I do; it&#39;&#39;s a very clear threat to them and I&#39;&#39;m hoping, for their sake, they understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli and I join Noah and head to the dining halls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I have to listen to one moreint about the state of the Councils&#39;&#39; quarters, I&#39;&#39;m going to lose my shit,&#34; he says under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we&#39;&#39;re about to enter the dining hall, something catches my eye off to a corner and I find Elden partially hidden. He beckons me over and I share a look with Noah; he nods and I head over to where Elden is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wolf, I need your help. Come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I just have lunch firs -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quick.&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grunt but follow him, hoping this is worth losing my lunch over.</p>
