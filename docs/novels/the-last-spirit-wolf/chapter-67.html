                <p>peaks, irp&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>g to whomever is at the door but I can&#39;&#39;t make out what they&#39;&#39;re saying; instead, I vel on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continues nibbling at my neck and caressing my breasts, as one hand slowly makes its way down, right where I want it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, to my annoyance, there&#39;&#39;s a loud, intrusive knock on the door. Noah stops and turns towards the direction of the door. &#34;It&#39;&#39;s Ezra, I have to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noo!&#34; I protest, grunting as his hand makes its way back up, towards my chin; he lifts it up gently to kiss me and he leaves the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was practically panting already and now he&#39;&#39;s leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah is getting dressed outside the bathroom but pops his head in,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come find me in the courtyard as soon as you&#39;&#39;re done, the ceremony will start in about an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell Ezra I&#39;&#39;m gonna kill him.&#34; I say through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noahughs and I hear the main door shut, meaning I&#39;&#39;m alone now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take my time to wash my hair this time; It&#39;&#39;s been so long since I&#39;&#39;ve tended to it. I also intended on cleaning up the wound on my forehead but it&#39;&#39;spletely healed; amazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I&#39;&#39;m done, I get dressed in regr jeans and a ck t-shirt. There is no protocol as to what to wear for these ceremonies, at least not one that I&#39;&#39;m aware of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I enter the courtyard, most of the lycans are already there, including our friends. I find Noah in the middle of a crowd and instead of disturbing him, I find something else to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk around for a bit, noting how there&#39;&#39;s an overall feeling of relief and calmness, one that I had never experienced here before. It really is something considering Alistair has been gone for less than 24 hours and already people feel better here. I smile to myself; this is all thanks to Eli and Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the crowd around the pyre continues to grow, I stay in a corner, observing everyone walking around as if a weight had been lifted off of their shoulders. Then, it&#39;&#39;s time to start the ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli steps in front of the pyre, looking solemn as he speaks,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brothers and sisters, it is with a heavy heart that we stand here, mourning the death of ourrades to such a noble cause,&#34; the entire crowd is silent, &#34;as some of you may know, this has been a long timeing. For many more than two decades we have been serving an undeserving King, a coward King, and a treacherous King, but now, all of our prayers have been answered! From now on we will serve with purpose! With pride! We will finally have a worthy King, a true King! All hail, King Noah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli gestures to Noah and he steps forward; the crowd goes wild, cheering for him and chanting his name. I have goosebumps all over my arms from the emotion in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah steps forward, carrying a live me on one of his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brothers and sisters,&#34; everyone goes silent again, &#34;I have always fought for you and alongside you, and I will continue to do so for as long as I shall live. Tonight, however, we don&#39;&#39;t celebrate this new era for lycans, tonight, we honor those who fought bravely and helped us trace this new path, a path worthy for us and our children. Tonight, we mourn and tomorrow we celebrate when we have Alistair&#39;&#39;s head!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd again goes wild, roaring like maniacs and chanting Noah&#39;&#39;s name once again. He nears the me to the pyre, starting it as the crowd chants in a battle cry manner; it&#39;&#39;s their way of mourning the warriors they lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming from such a different culture, it really is fascinating to observe lycans from up close. They have apletely different perception of death. While wolves mourn the fact that we won&#39;&#39;t again see our loved ones in this lifetime, lycans celebrate their deaths as the highest honor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the pyre is fully ignited, the crowd has broken down into groups. Some are drinking heavily, others are less boisterous, talking andughing amongst themselves. I walk towards Noah now that there aren&#39;&#39;t as many people around him. I notice as I make my way to him that Elden is actually here, off to a corner on his own. I think of going to him first but Noah spots me and calls me over. He has a beer on his hand and I&#39;&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;&#39;s tipsy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go to his side and he hugs me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our hero!&#34; Ezra says and I narrow my eyes at him,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You and I need to have a little talk about something.&#34; I point at him usingly and he and Noah burst outughing, tears in their eyes. They&#39;&#39;re definitely drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We keep chatting andughing about Noah&#39;&#39;s childhood, how he was always pranking Eli and the other teachers but nobody ever dared give him away because he&#39;&#39;d kick their asses; everyone else would get med but Noah. Judging from Eli&#39;&#39;s reaction, this is the first time he&#39;&#39;s hearing about it and he&#39;&#39;s not happy, causing even me tough. &#34;Hey, boss!&#34; One of the younger guards approaches us, &#34;we did as you asked, here&#39;&#39;s the prison- I&#39;&#39;m sorry, Chirp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An old manes up behind the guard, looking extremely fragile and malnourished. He can&#39;&#39;t really walk right; he&#39;&#39;s being aided by the other guard. Instinctively, I go to him, my doctor brain kicking in and assessing his condition, hoping toe up with a treatment n if possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you I&#39;&#39;d see you again, Chirp.&#34; Noah says, smiling at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I get close to him, I take over holding his hand as support, and something happens. It&#39;&#39;s as if something clicks as he looks at me. His eyes suddenly don&#39;&#39;t look lost, he looks focused. He turns his attention to Noah, and walks towards him without letting go of my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He approaches Noah, maybe a little too close, and reaches for him with his free hand. He&#39;&#39;s inspecting his hair, his eyes, he even lifts Noah&#39;&#39;s lips to inspect his teeth. The entire thing is incredibly bizarre and now everyone still in the courtyard is staring at the scene. &#34;Ok, ok,&#34; Noah says, taking Chirp&#39;&#39;s hand and cing it to his side, &#34;I missed you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew it.&#34; Chirp says, his expressionpletely serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elden hase out of his corner and is now behind Noah, looking extremely shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It can&#39;&#39;t be,&#34; Elden says, sniffing the air and approaching us tentatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hees up and touches Chirp&#39;&#39;s face lightly, unsure, examining his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no this can&#39;&#39;t be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s good to see you again, my friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beta Caleb,&#34; Elden says, &#34;It&#39;&#39;s been too long, old friend.&#34;</p>
