                <p>&#34;Noah!&#34; Veraughs, it&#39;&#39;s the sweetest sound in the world, &#34;we have to get out of this room!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow, I promise,&#34; I say, nibbling at her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said that four days ago!&#34; She protests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This time it&#39;&#39;s for real,&#34; I lie, again, moving my hand to caress her breasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said that two days ago!&#34; She&#39;&#39;s trying to push me off of her rather feebly; I know what spots to kiss and lick to get my way by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what Vera told me, I had been unconscious for two entire weeks, making everyone wonder if I was going to wake up at all. It turns out, even after my physical wounds were already healed, I needed a little more time for my body to fight off the witch&#39;&#39;s spell. Vera&#39;&#39;s idea to mark me was brilliant. Considering my healing abilities were transmitted to her from my mark, it made perfect sense that hers would also be shared with me; only her healing abilities are more so catered to magic. Not that I didn&#39;&#39;t give her shit when I found out she marked me while I was unconscious; I had ns of how I wanted to be marked and they didn&#39;&#39;t involve being asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally opened my eyes and Vera exined everything. I made her lock the room and not tell anyone I had woken up. Well, it&#39;&#39;s been an entire week since I woke up and we have not left this room once. It&#39;&#39;s fine though. Not a day had gone by before people started noticing all the noiseing from this room; if that didn&#39;&#39;t hint at my full recovery, I don&#39;&#39;t know what would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, I wouldn&#39;&#39;t mind spending another week couped up in here with you,&#34; I tell her as I lift up her shirt. Really, that&#39;&#39;s been the only barrier between us as I have not once put on clothes and she wears nothing underneath my t-shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never got to tell her how much I loved that she wore my t-shirt and nothing else to sleep; it&#39;&#39;s about time I showed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dive beneath the shirt and take one of her breasts in my mouth, teasing her n****e with my tongue and teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;&#39;s no longer protesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arches her back, silently pleading for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move on to the next breast; licking, biting and teasing them back and forth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she&#39;&#39;s finally moaning; it&#39;&#39;s quiet, but it&#39;&#39;s all the encouragement I need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I start to smell her need and grin to myself, confidently moving past her breasts, making my way down her soft skin. I can&#39;&#39;t exin how much I love her reaction as I lick and nick at her skin gently; I can feel her goosebumps with my tongue. When I reach her most sensitive spot, I part her legs without much effort, beginning to gently and slowly kiss her clit, teasing her more.Content ? provided by N?velDrama.Org.</p>

                <p>I smile, intending on teasing her until she goes crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After only a few minutes, she gets up quickly, lifting my face with both of her hands; we&#39;&#39;re both sitting now, only she&#39;&#39;s straddling me and grinding up against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like you impatient,&#34; I smile into her kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She keeps kissing me; it&#39;&#39;s a desperate kiss, but today I n on taking my time with her. I don&#39;&#39;t know how much longer the council will let me evade my responsibilities as King, so I n to make the most of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hug her with one arm while my free hand goes to her hair, slowing her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just like to torture me, don&#39;&#39;t you?&#34; she breathes into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe,&#34; I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;ve been doing that a lottely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I position myself at her entrance and she slowly lowers herself onto me. Her head tilts back slightly, giving me ess to kiss her neck, right where my mark sits proudly. She moans loudly this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was wrong; *this* is the sweetest sound in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She starts moving her hips slowly, up and down, up and down, while holding on to my shoulders. I can feel us both begin to build up to an orgasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;&#39;t realize it was possible but ever since she marked me, our connection got much stronger. Now, we are truly one and I feel her as if she lived inside my chest; I am in tune to her moods, her feelings, her needs and her fears. Vera keeps moaning softly as she builds up to her orgasm and I&#39;&#39;m just enjoying the view when a knock interrupts us. Vera&#39;&#39;s eyes fly open and she stares at me wide eyed; she&#39;&#39;s also stopped moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yell at the door, already annoyed that they&#39;&#39;d make Vera stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh... Your Highness?&#34; Comes a small, trepidatious voice from the other side of the door, &#34;we&#39;&#39;ve had to call for an emergency council meeting... the uh... the rogue attacks have intensified and we... we&#39;&#39;d like to request your presence.&#34; Vera chuckles,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, Your Highness,&#34; she sits up, letting me slip out of her and I gape at her, &#34;it seems like duty calls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gets up from the bed, heading to the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or so she thinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bolt from the bed, feeling my lycan begin to stir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your... Highness?&#34; The voice asks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LEAVE,&#34; my lycan says. I hear the person shuffling away in a hurry after that; I can smell his fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I intercept Vera before she enters the bathroom and she gasps at the suddenness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you would use *me* of t*****e?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckles but I&#39;&#39;m too impatient now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lift her up, cing her back against the wall while my arms snake the backs of her knees; putting in her in the position I want. She&#39;&#39;s helpless like this and she hangs onto my shoulders for support. I enter her quickly, crudely, and her eyes flutter close as she moans. The sound of her wetness as I m into her again and again, coupled with her wild moans, is driving me crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growl, my lycan just below the surface, enjoying this as much as I am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kiss her, lick her, nick her, until I feel her tense around my erection, signaling that she&#39;&#39;s about to o****m. After a few more plunges into her she starts spasming; her muscles squeeze my dick for all its worth, making the next few thrusts my undoing. We both moan out our orgasms, sinking into each other for support. We&#39;&#39;re a sweaty, tired mess, and I wouldn&#39;&#39;t change a thing about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without putting her down, I carry her to the shower, her eyes now sleepy and her bodypletely rxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leans her back to my chest as I turn on the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, I think this technically counts as a wolf-moon,&#34; she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A wolf-moon. When two wolves be mates and mark each other, they&#39;&#39;re not expected at ss or their jobs for weeks. Now I know why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I begin tother her hair with shampoo and we both take a few moments to clean ourselves before we head out, reluctantly I might add, to the real world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we&#39;&#39;re done, we get dressed and head to the council meeting room, ready to face whateveres next.</p>
