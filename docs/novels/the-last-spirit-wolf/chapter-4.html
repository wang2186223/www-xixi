                <p>agreed but, as we came to inspect many of our brothers’ bodies, we realized that no beast known to us</p>
                
                
                
                <p>could’ve caused this type of damage. Eli was first to voice his opinion,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It was wolves,” he scowled and affirmed with absolute certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I have never met any wolf that could cause this, Eli, not against a lycan.” Noah does not share the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>deep-rooted hate for werewolves that Eli has.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We are right by their border, kid! If not them, whom?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Eli, look around you! Not a single dead wolf? Not a single surviving lycan? And more importantly, no</p>
                
                
                
                <p>smell of wolf!” Eli grimaced, he knew Noah was right, but even I found myself wanting to believe the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wolves were to me if only to make some sense of this. The alternative that this beast was something</p>
                
                
                
                <p>unknown, far more powerful than us, was sending waves of fear throughout my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We have to give them proper burial,” Noah said and we all agreed, even if it would take us all day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took us hours to gather enough firewood for the funeral pyre. A proper send-off would’ve been done</p>
                
                
                
                <p>at the main castle, with all of our brothers and sisters present and mourning. At dawn, we would’ve lit</p>
                
                
                
                <p>up the fire, sending our brothers into the afterlife. But we had no time, and we knew that the Council</p>
                
                
                
                <p>would not bother on transporting them for any proper ceremony. We had to do it ourselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we set the bodies, picking them up one by one, my stomach started to churn and my eyes to sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking them up grounded me to what had happened. I contained my need to cry, as we ced them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>on the pyre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we were done, Eli set it all on fire and we all bowed our heads in respect. I looked to Noah, and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he had a solemn look on his face. The fire had engulfed all of them, and it was a matter of time before it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>would all turn to ash. We remained silent for the rest of our makeshift ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the fire had consumed itself, the sun was about to go down. Lycans have very good vision in the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>dark, so the walk back was not my concern, but what we might encounter was. Noah was the first to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>move, heading towards the camp-site, no doubt looking for clues. Clearly it had been a surprise attack,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>everything was in disarray. The beds were not even made, which indicated that the warriors got up in a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hurry to fight. This had happened very early in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as we were gathering some evidence for the council, a noise was heard deep within the forest and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>birds were flying away in a hurry. A chill imed my spine. I was ready to shift any moment but Eli put a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hand on my shoulder, looking into the forest. Noah stepped in front of us. Cautiously walking towards</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the sound. We didn’t move, we didn’t breathe, we didn’t dare utter a sound in expectation of what could</p>
                
                
                
                <p>be out there. It was very close to wolf territory, but not quite there. This was still lycan territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We heard the sound again, closer, and I almost jumped out of my skin. My lycan was on high alert, with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the hairs on my nape standing up. Eli’s eyes had turned ck, indicating that his lycan was also just</p>
                
                
                
                <p>below the surface. The sound was something like a big thud, almost like arge tree had fallen over,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but we knew better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Noah shifted a few meters in front of us andunched himself in the air, fangs and ws out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not needing any indication of what he had seen, Eli and I shifted and went after it too. Noahtched</p>
                
                
                
                <p>onto something, in the middle of the air! We both attacked, but missed. As Noah was furiously biting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>whatever it was that hade our way, Eli and I both kept jumping and missing. When I finally felt like I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hadtched onto something, it caught my leg, painfully crushing my ankle, and crushing me against the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ground. I whimpered in pain, but mostly confusion. I noticed Noah was also on the ground, looking far</p>
                
                
                
                <p>worse than I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eli came to stand in front of us to protect us though we couldn’t see the enemy. At first, I thought it was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>simply too fast for me to see, but in reality, this thing was invisible. Invisible! Noah and I exchanged a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>look, and he made the signal. A paw to his shoulder meant retreat. Before we could signal Eli, it was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pinning him violently to the ground. The old lycan whimpered as both Noah and Iunched ourselves to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the air,tching on to the beast. It wiggled us around until it released Eli, then he grabbed me by my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>middle and crushed me too. Noah saw this and deepened its fangs into it, forcing it to release me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I helped Eli up and assessed his wounds; the old man wasn’t looking so good. Noah came to us and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>we started to retreat, but the beast was already waiting and in our way. This time, I paid more attention</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and could see a very faint silhouette. It was too big for me to gauge before, but now, I understood and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>panic gripped my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quite simply, if we didn’t manage to escape, we would die.</p>
