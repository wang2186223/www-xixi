                <p>-Vera-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you want to do this, Liam?&#34; I ask as we head towards one of the alternate entrances to the castle. It&#39;&#39;s midnight and only the night guards are up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;&#39;t really have a choice.&#34; He says, resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah had given Liam the chance to run away with Harriet and they were about to do just that, or so he thought. Harriet stabbed Liam in his back numerous times, leaving him for dead and shing her mark off of his neck before taking off on her own. Now, instead of being branded by his mate&#39;&#39;s love, he is branded forever by his mate&#39;&#39;s rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It makes me angry that I didn&#39;&#39;t kill her when I had the chance. Now, she&#39;&#39;s run off to goddess knows where and Liam has volunteered to go after her and kill her himself. This is his one chance to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers; if he fails, he might as well note back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slings his bag over his shoulder and turns to Noah, who has his arms crossed. Liam simply nods at him and starts to turn his back to us, but before he can, Noah stops him. He gets closer to him and gives him a hug and a few pats on his back. &#34;You always have a home here, Liam, remember that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam nods but he doesn&#39;&#39;t hug Noah back. His eyesnd on mine and I smile slightly, he does too, but those are undeniably the eyes of a broken man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Noah breaks off the hug, hees to stand at my side and I wave as Liamposes himself and heads into the woods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His real mission, assigned by the council, is to infiltrate the rogues that are progressively taking over more and more lycan territory; but his mission to find Harriet has been sanctioned by Noah; he will take care of both missions at the same time. Noah and I stay looking at Liam&#39;&#39;s figure as he disappears into the woods, his shoulders somewhat slumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m surprised you offered him toe back,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That man has been through enough. I can&#39;&#39;t even imagine what a mess I&#39;&#39;d be if you ever... left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harriet didn&#39;&#39;t just leave.&#34; I point out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which makes it worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happens when a mark is removed?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely nothing, the connection is still there. Removing a mark is only done to humiliate someone, to show the rest of the world that you&#39;&#39;re not even wanted by your mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear I should have killed her,&#34; I mutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he turns to me, &#34;I should have. I made the mistake of trusting Liam&#39;&#39;smon sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He takes my hand and leads me into the council meeting room again. It&#39;&#39;s empty at this time of night, and I&#39;&#39;m surprised he wants toe back here after we spent almost all day sitting here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There is a massive map in the middle of the table with all kinds of figurines, depicting where our warriors are and how the rogues are expanding into the territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes of admiring the map, Noah speaks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;&#39;t want anyone knowing you&#39;&#39;re half witch.&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, I think it&#39;&#39;s pretty evident,&#34; I frown at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;ve had the guys ask around, most of them think your... abilities...e from being a wolf. Most of them had never met a wolf in their lives, much less a witch,&#34; he says, looking at the map. &#34;And why don&#39;&#39;t you want them to know, exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lycans are simple creatures; they know a witch was behind Alistair&#39;&#39;s attack and they&#39;&#39;ll put you into the same bag as her if they knew you were also a witch... and you&#39;&#39;re already a wolf and you know how hard that&#39;&#39;s been for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stay quiet for a moment. There are a lot of changes happening very quickly, and even if Noah is the legitimate king, he still has a lot to prove to the council and more importantly, to his people.Please visit Jo :b nib and search the book title to read the entire book for free. If they found out his mate is a witch... on top of being a wolf...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m sorry Vera. It won&#39;&#39;t be forever,&#34; he says, turning to me and putting his hands on my arms, &#34;I promise as soon as I know it&#39;&#39;s safe for you, you wont have to hide but for now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I interrupt him, &#34;it makes perfect sense. Besides, we don&#39;&#39;t want that Witch Mother finding out who I am just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raises his eyebrow at me this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;&#39;s a long story.&#34; I exin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone clears their throat behind us. Both Noah and I turn to the door and it&#39;&#39;s none other than Beta Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May I have a ...word?&#34; He says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn to leave to give them some privacy, but he stops me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, please, with both of you, if that&#39;&#39;s okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah nods and we sit at the table. Caleb closes the door behind him before sitting across from us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uhm, I&#39;&#39;ve been meaning to talk to you both, I feel like... I feel like I owe you two an exnation... to the entire council really... I just haven&#39;&#39;t... I&#39;&#39;m still...&#34; His hand brushes over his head in exasperation, &#34;I&#39;&#39;m sorry I don&#39;&#39;t even know where to start.&#34; &#34;Take your time,&#34; I smile at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiles back but there is so much sadness in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Elden tells me you already know who your father is,&#34; he looks at Noah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And my mother,&#34; Noah interrupts him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you already know you&#39;&#39;re half wolf. Luckily from what I can tell, you seem to be mostly lycan,&#34; he says and Noah nods in confirmation, &#34;well, nobody knew who your mother was, in fact nobody knew King Alexander even had a mate, much less that she was a wolf. He didn&#39;&#39;t mind people knowing, but she was already mated to someone else and for the sake avoiding conflict with the wolves, we kept it quiet. Only he, Ellie and I knew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah perks up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, her name was Ellie Goldmoon,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From the... Gold Moon n?&#34; I interject, my mouth hanging open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know of them. Much like the Allens, Sofia&#39;&#39;s bloodline, the Goldmoons are what in wolf society would be considered royalty. They have the second biggest pack in all the territory, after ours.&#34;N?velDrama.Org owns ? this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Correct. Which is why her rtionship to your father had to be kept a secret. That and...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pauses, looking at us apprehensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That and what?&#34; Noah asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything changed with Alistair of course, because he wasn&#39;&#39;t a royal he didn&#39;&#39;t follow royal protocol, but Noah... the King is not supposed to mate with his... mate,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of bullshit is that?&#34; Noah asks, irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The kind of bullshit that keeps alliances stable and territories safe,&#34; he says seriously, &#34;even if you already have a mate,&#34; he eyes my mark on Noah&#39;&#39;s neck, &#34;you are meant to marry someone who can provide alliances beneficial to the kingdom. Your mate is never supposed to bare your children, only your spouse is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;&#39;m gaping at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah sits up and begins to pace, probably trying to calm himself down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I know. It *is* bullshit, but I didn&#39;&#39;t make the rules,&#34; he puts his hands up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what you came to say?! To &#34;suggest&#34; I take a &#34;spouse?&#34; Noah&#39;&#39;s lycan has begun to swirl</p>
                
                
                
                <p>in his pupils and I go to him, taking his hands in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, hey, look at me. Nobody is going to separate us, Noah. Breathe, calm down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, I... I actually came here to apologize. What happened with Alistair, everything with your parents, it was all my fault,&#34; his voice cracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both turn to look at him as his hand flies to his face, covering his eyes. After heposes himself, he turns to us again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alistair started seeing a witch many, many years ago. I should have stopped it. I should have known that nothing good coulde out of it and I did nothing. She tricked him into believing she was his mate with some... some spell... I ...&#34; he adjusts his throat, &#34;it&#39;&#39;s the same witch that hexed me and the same one that was controlling his army. I never knew what her interest in Alistair was, it was just clear to me that she wanted your father dead for some reason. Noah,&#34; he looks at him seriously, &#34;you survived by chance, because nobody knew of your existence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah sits back and crosses his arms as he thinks, then he looks at me but before he speaks, I know what he wants,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;ll ask them.&#34; I say gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabs my hand and kisses it. Caleb regarding the gesture with a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In truth, I came here to apologize for not killing my son when I had the chance. All of this, your father&#39;&#39;s death, Alistair&#39;&#39;s atrocious rule, it&#39;&#39;s all because of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;&#39;s looking at the floor now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;&#39;s a lot of regret going aroundtely,&#34; I say absentmindedly, thinking of Harriet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only thing I have to offer, Noah... Your Highness... is my service at your side. I may not be beta material anymore, but I have learned from all of my mistakes, even the ones I made with your father. When the entire world is against you, Noah, I will be on your side, always, if you will have me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sincerity is obvious in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few moments, Noah gets up and goes to Caleb&#39;&#39;s side, who hastily gets up and tries to bow but Noah stops him, taking his hand and shaking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a deal,&#34; Noah says and Caleb smiles, his eyes ssy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the moment is over, he turns to me,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I owe you an apology, Vera. When I saw your eyes I just... I know one witch does not represent all but I just... my pledge to be on Noah&#39;&#39;s side of course applies to you as well.&#34; &#34;My eyes?&#34; I frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your wolf&#39;&#39;s eyes,&#34; he says as if this is supposed to ring a bell. When he notices my frown he continues, &#34;Vera, your wolf&#39;&#39;s eyes are white, like a witch&#39;&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh?</p>
