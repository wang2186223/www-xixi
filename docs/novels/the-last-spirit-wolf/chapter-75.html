                <p>&#34;Guys, could we have the room, please?&#34; I say a little too nicely.</p>

                <p>working at the clinic was. I can&#39;&#39;t help but wonder what everyone home is up to. Maybe once this is all over, I can go home and visit for a few days. for me to do there since most of the Council is now on board with Noah&#39;&#39;s proposals.</p>

                <p>de of the castle are too vast to expect trackers to find Alistair&#39;&#39;s tracks, especially now that so many days have passed, so maybe I can use my abilities to find hest thing they were saying:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the sound of my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sh looks between Noah and I; almost like they were doing something they are not supposed to. They all excuse themselves and make their way to the exit,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Surely*, you weren&#39;&#39;t thinking of leaving this castle, were you? Not now that you are King, and * surely you weren&#39;&#39;t nning on leaving *me* again.&#34; I say, not even caring to hide the venom in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to make sure he is found and killed, I will not make the same mistake Alexander made, underestimating Alistair caused him his life and his family,&#34; he&#39;&#39;s visibly upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see. You&#39;&#39;re making this personal. But have you not considered that this is might be exactly what he wants? If he gets rid of you there is absolutely no one else left to defy him, no one else that the people will follow.&#34;N?velDrama.Org owns ? this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can I not make this personal?! He killed my father and presumably my mother, and if I don&#39;&#39;t find him first, he&#39;&#39;lle after us, after you, Vera! I will not allow that to happen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;&#39;s speaking through clenched teeth now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Noah, you can&#39;&#39;t think only about yourself anymore, you are King now! Your wellbeing is the kingdom&#39;&#39;s wellbeing! Besides, have you not even considered that we are a team now? You don&#39;&#39;t have to keep me from anything Noah, I am your equal, not a damsel in distress. In any case if he&#39;&#39;s a threat to both of us, we should both go after him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;&#39;s fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That will not happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Because you don&#39;&#39;t trust my abilities? I could singlehandedly destroy every single lycan you throw my way.&#34; I&#39;&#39;m equally angry now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I can&#39;&#39;t lose you!&#34; He yells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both stay quiet for a moment, my anger not diminishing in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;&#39;t lose you; you are the only thing I have left. Why do you even think I agreed to all of this? Because there was no way that bastard was going to stop pursuing you, mark or no mark. He&#39;&#39;s a power hungry a*****e that would stop at nothing to have you. Vera, you have to trust me on this, *please*&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you have to trust *me*. You *should not* go looking for him, Noah! We don&#39;&#39;t even know where to start looking, let alone what he&#39;&#39;s been up to these past few weeks! What if he ambushes you? What will five of you do against an entire army?! I&#39;&#39;ve heard you talk about Liam&#39;&#39;s and Mason&#39;&#39;s tracking skills, let them handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenches his fist,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;&#39;m not good at delegating. Vera. You should know th -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then you better start practicing. *Your Highness,&#34; I say as I turn around to leave, smashing the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk around aimlessly through the castle after my fight with Noah. I really can&#39;&#39;t understand how thick headed men are sometimes, and they say we are the illogical ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as we&#39;&#39;re concerned, we don&#39;&#39;t know where Alistair is, we don&#39;&#39;t know what he&#39;&#39;s up to, and we don&#39;&#39;t even know how many moles he can have within the castle walls. Going out and hunting him down is the single most idiotic n Noah has evere up with. Does he not understand how crucial he is to everything now? Especially now that we know his parentage. He is not only King now but he is the veryst of his n.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire world could burn down, and he still would be the only one capable of building it back up.</p>
