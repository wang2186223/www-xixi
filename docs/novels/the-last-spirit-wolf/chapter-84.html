                <p>I always heard that the first shift to a beast form is incredibly painful. How, much like growing pains, w</p>
                
                
                
                <p>itively try to fight it as much as we can because our body does not yet understand that it isn&#39;&#39;t dying, it&#39;&#39;s only changing. Some people spend days, weeks, with this pain before inevitably giving in to it and shifting. After it&#39;&#39;s over, it is said to be the most liberating feeling of all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have no time to think about any of this too deeply. It is indeed excruciating pain as I can feel my eve ne breaking under the pressure of the shift, but instead of shying away from it, I wee it. cing Noah&#39;&#39;s head gently on the floor, I crawl a few paces away from him. I&#39;&#39;ve never shifted before som pot sure how this will go, I just know I can&#39;&#39;t afford to hurt him further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel my spine elongate and curve, my arms bulk up and fur begins to explode from underneath my s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It feels like hours before it&#39;&#39;s over, but in reality, the transition probably took less than a minute. &#34;What the fuck?&#34; Alistair says, stepping back a few paces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>jaw starts to break and elongate as well, making it perhaps the most painful part. It is a pain that I feel in my every nerve ending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I open my eyes, my vision is the sharpest it has ever been, it&#39;&#39;s almost as if every movement around me is in slow motion. I have never shifted to my wolf form, so I am not sure how I&#39;&#39;m supposed to handle this; but I remember something Sofia told me a long time ago, to just let my wolf guide me through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snarl furiously at Alistair, my full set of teeth showing menacingly. He keeps retreating and I step gently over Noah, protectively. I turn my face to him and he&#39;&#39;s looking at me with a gentle smile on his face.    He&#39;&#39;s looking very pale, I know I have to make quick work of these two to et him help. I lick his face reassuringly before I step past him and turn to Alistair once again. &#34;You... your eyes,&#34; he says, &#34;are you seeing this?!&#34; He yells at the witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can still feel her standing there, looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;&#39;s weird, but in this form, it&#39;&#39;s as if my connection to the forest is permanent, I no longer have to cond steadily coursing through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Iunch towards Alistair and he quickly shifts to his lycan form, dodging my attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>e on it to get its feedback; its readily avable for me at any moment. I also feel like my magic is freely flowing through me now; small, electric shocks</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Iunch again but this time. I falsify my step, making him believe I will go left and instead go right, grabbing him with the full force of my jaw by his shoulder. I forcefully separate from him using my hind legs before he can react. I feel a chunk of his shoulder detach from his arm as I ripped it off with my teeth. He falls to his knees in an attempt to swing his ws at re</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alistair was already tired and severely injured by Noahing into this fight; so was I until I switched to my wolf form and before I was fueled by pure rage after seeing Noah injured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take advantage of his shock to go after him again, my ear twitching in the direction of the witch whoaying to use the same spell she used on Noah on me,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Mortem!* She yells, &#34;*mortem, mortem, mortem!&#34; She repeats desperately, her slender finger slightly trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as I&#39;&#39;d like to take my time to dismember Alistair and make him pay for everything he&#39;&#39;s done, I have to think of Noah first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a big leap so that Ie over him, standing behind him. I attack him from behind. sinking my teeth into his nape. He screams and ws at me, trying to get me off of him. As it is, he can only use one arm against me since the other one is too wounded from my earlier attack. I feel him actually puncture my skin deeply, drawing blood, but I don&#39;&#39;t care about the pain... not anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bite down harder on his neck, until I feel him go limp against my grasp. Once that&#39;&#39;s over, I turn my full attention to the witch. I growl and snarl at her, stalking her as she&#39;&#39;s taking slow steps backwards,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It can&#39;&#39;t be, you can&#39;&#39;t be real!&#34; she says in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel Alistair&#39;&#39;s blood dripping from my snout as I growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The witch is visibly shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly turns around, attempting to escape. She has no chance to outrun me; not in my human form much less in my wolf form, but she still tries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;&#39;t have time for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Stay still,* I think to myself, and she actually freezes in ce, mid step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach her just secondster, circling her slowly to look her in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes are wide and panicky, I can see beads of sweat forming in her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;&#39;t kill me. I&#39;&#39;ll do anything. I gave Alistair everything he wanted, imagine what I can do for you,&#34; she pleads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growl at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No no! Please! You have magic, I can see as much. I can take you to my mistress, she can teach you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ear twitches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;&#39;d like that, right? She&#39;&#39;s the best! She&#39;&#39;s our Witch Mother and you... you&#39;&#39;re a spirit wolf, right? You&#39;&#39;ll be her absolute favorite!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly shift into my human form. I&#39;&#39;m naked, covered in blood and grime, but I need for her to look me in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;&#39;t... I didn&#39;&#39;t think your kind was real,&#34; she says, a little more rxed now that I&#39;&#39;m in my human form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She misinterprets my intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted you to be able to look into my eyes as I did this...&#34; I say.</p>

                <p>She gasps as I punch my hand through her chest and reach her heart, squeezing it slowly as I take it out. I see the life drain out of her eyes and she falls to the ground. The heart beats a few times before itpletely stops. When it does, I crush it.N?vel/Dr(a)ma.Org - Content owner.</p>
