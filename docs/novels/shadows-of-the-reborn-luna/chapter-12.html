                <p>Three Days After.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heat period lasted for three days. Three whole days. Valentina stayed holed up in the room all day, unable to leave, or even see any one. Remy was with her throughout her entire ordeal. He was very supportive and he provide her with the comfort that she needed. She was glad of it all when it was all finally over. Even though at first she had been skeptical in the beginning when she was informed that she was a werewolf. But as she passed each stage of her heat period, the answer to her question became increasingly clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy had been with her all the night too, during the toughest moment, providing her with as much support as he could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There you are!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellen exclaimed as she rushed towards Valentina who looked bashful. The woman looked surprisingly energetic even though it was still the early hours of the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well, Aren&#39;t you a sight for sore eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellen beamed as she touched her shoulders lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning Ellen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m guessing Remy has told you everything now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About me being a werewolf, yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina watched Ellen&#39;s reaction and saw a smile on forming on the woman&#39;s face. The woman looked slightly relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you understand why we all couldn&#39;t say anything, it wasn&#39;t in our place to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellen sounded apologetic. Valentina understood, after all, Remy had warned them not to say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Of course, You&#39;ll have to listen to your Alpha. I don&#39;t blame you for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yesss! And you are his Luna. The pack missed you so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina rolled her eyes. She doubted that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t exaggerate Ellen, they barely knew me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellen chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh why would I exaggerate? Did Remy tell you about the history of our pack? We&#39;ve had no Luna for decades!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes. Yes, he did tell her, in fact it was one of the many stories that he had told her while she was in heat and locked up in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Remy? I haven&#39;t seen him all day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellen glanced around, she turned back to Valentina and gave her a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He isn&#39;t with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he must have left very early in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes. Maybe he went for his morning run. Since there&#39;s nothing to hide now, I&#39;m sure he must miss running in his wolf form.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman smiled fondly and Valentina wondered what she was getting at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle appeared from the end of the hallway. She was dressed in slacks and there was a wet towel slung over her shoulder. She approached them and waved at them. Valentina wasn&#39;t sure she was up for conversation but she waved back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody could run in their wolf form to risk been seen by you, especially Remy so he hasn&#39;t been on a good run in a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle murmured to them both as she inched closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle tuned to Valentina, her face was slick with sweat and strands of her hair was plastered on her face, but she still smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should address you properly, now that you know what you are,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no use for formalities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina replied quickly, she didn&#39;t know how she would react if everyone started calling her &#39;Luna&#39;. It would be too strange for her to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, You&#39;re my Luna, I will give you the respect that you deserve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small blush crept to Valentina&#39;s cheeks and she looked away quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered what was for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you insist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied as they started walking towards the dining room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mansion was bustling with movement, the news that the Luna was in heat spread far and wide and the pack members started jubilating. It was a great thing when a Luna was in heat. Heat meant that mating and mating brought along a new heir. But Valentina and Remy did not mate, while the thought had crossed her mind much more than once while they were together, her resolve was strong and she fought against the temptation.  She blamed it on the heat period, it was the only reasonable explanation for her developing such feelings for Remy in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More people were also in the house, since they didn&#39;t need to hide or walk on tippy toes around her anymore. Valentina had hoped that the experience would somehow juggle her memory but nothing came up, nothing but the same dream. The dream of the curly headed girl with green eyes that she kept seeing. This time, she kept it to herself and she didn&#39;t tell anyone, not willing to be a burden to Remy who was constantly worrying about her and being by her side all through her heat period.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the dinner table, she met some faces she did not recognise. They had all been eager to meet her, Ellen introduced them as core members of the pack. Close relatives of the family too, Valentina was polite to them, despite their many questions about her accident and her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her memory seemed to be a hot topic among all of them, everyone was concerned about her in that regard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally settled down, she served herself some toast and some butter. Someone brought some coffee for her from the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle sat next to her, she must have freshened up since she no longer looked sweaty and she was wearing clean clothes. She filled up her plate up with a lot more food than Valentina did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, did you end up remembering anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and Valentina looked at her with a confused expression on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remembering what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and Marielle took a generous bite out of her eggs before replying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your memories duh!!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina simply said. Not knowing what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t remember anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a prolonged silence between the two women before Marielle continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We had all thought the heat period might trigger some of your past memories and that you would remember something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well it did nothing. Nothing but provide her with great discomfort and more time than she cared to spend with Remy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing happened. I still don&#39;t remember anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured as she slammed her fork on the plate, making a loud clanging noise. Ellen turned to her with a worried look on her face, Valentina flashed her an apologetic smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy walked in around that moment, he looked straight ahead, not even sparing a glance at her. She had not noticed before, but there was an aura around him that she had no idea about. The way his presence demanded respect, demanded to be felt and seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like Marielle had mentioned he had just come back from a run, but he didn&#39;t look like it.  Although he was in clean dry clothes, a loose black shirt with grey pants, his hair still looked a little damp and the unruly strands framed his face perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met, but that was just about all the interaction they would get. Valentina looked away quickly, colour staining her cheeks as she remembered all the nights they had to spend together bundled up in bed and touching each other and this was all a few hours ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale had walked in with him, quickly sitting next to his alpha and grabbing a piece of bread from the bread basket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you feel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up from her food Valentina could tell that the question was directed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. Do you remember anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;i don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied curtly and Remy nodded his head. For some reason he didn&#39;t look too surprised by her answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a full moon approaching in about a week. Since you have no recollection of being a werewolf, Marielle will help you with shifting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina nodded. She was in no mood to argue, or ask for the specifics. She would do all that later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;ve decided to take you to a specialist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A specialist?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She repeated and Remy nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your doctor recommended it. He said seeing the specialist might help you regain your memories faster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When do we leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy&#39;s face furrowed in deep thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know yet. I have some errands to run and I&#39;ll have to schedule a meeting with the specialist first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The specialist comes highly recommended. So I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be able to help you regain your memories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, Valentina retreated back to her room, declining the invitation of Ellen to take a walk with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her room, she heard the ringing of a phone and set out to investigate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her phone!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since most of what was on the phone was strange and foreign to her, she had simply left it on the dresser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caller ID was unknown, but Valentina still picked the call out of curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no answer. Only the sound of someone breathing heavily from the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said again, this time a little bit more concerned and slightly pissed that whoever it was was, they weren&#39;t saying anything, but their breathing got louder, faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear gripped Valentina as she threw the phone on the bed.</p>
