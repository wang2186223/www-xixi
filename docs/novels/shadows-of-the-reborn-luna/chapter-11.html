                <p>Words were pouring out of Remy&#39;s mouth but Valentina wasn&#39;t sure she was listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words like heat, cycle, mate. She didn&#39;t understand what was going on, her entire mind was in a state of turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Remy was shouting!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So loud that it was hurting her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was barking out orders to Kale while he guarded the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina sat at the edge of the bed, her temperature was getting worse, it felt as if she was melting, or her blood was boiling, worse, it was affecting her vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vision was not spared, everything looked red, as if she was looking through red tinged glasses.  Her ears became so sensitive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held her head in her hands, she closed her eyes tightly, trying to control herself. Trying to calm herself down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash Remy was by her side and she weakly protested that he let her go but he refused. He wrapped his burly arms around her and something about the simple gesture made her feel so much better. She couldn&#39;t explain why she felt better, only that something about the hug made her temperature drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her to the bed, with his arms still around her and her head felt so much clearer. She panted slightly as she blew the air out of her face, she felt so much better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her eyes and saw that she could see clearly, the red tinge that clouded her vision disappeared and it felt like a wave of cool air was poured all over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?! How did you do that?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked after she garnered enough strength to talk and Remy chuckled. With him so close to her, his breath tickled her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Magic?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered sarcastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina rolled her eyes, then she tried to pull away from his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m serious, what happened?! And how did you do that?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked as she finally struggled out of his grasp and turned to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy sighed, he sat upright on the bed, his fingers scratching his chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a lot of things I haven&#39;t told you. Things about yourself and things about us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what is that?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew it! She knew he was hiding something from her. She just didn&#39;t expect that he would actually confess it himself. She wondered if he would at least be truthful about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to sit down for this and let me hold you unless you want to get another hot flash, you&#39;re in the first stages of heat and there will be more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against her better judgement, Valentina decided to trust him and she let him hold her. His large arms wrapped around her waist as he pulled her close to him. The scent of him filled the air as she wondered why she suddenly couldn&#39;t stop looking at his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods he was hot. He was gorgeous and the more she looked at him, the more she could feel another hot flash coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s wrong with me?! She screamed to herself and Remy shot her a look, almost as if he could tell what she was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he know?! Did he know what she was thinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax. I know what you&#39;re going through. It&#39;s normal. It&#39;s completely normal&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is normal?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hot flash, the emotions... the desire...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina chuckled nervously. Desire? What the hell was he talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you talking about?! Desire for what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Desire for me. It&#39;s only natural. Trust me, it&#39;s a pretty natural feeling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a silly grin on Remy&#39;s face that Valentina so badly wished to slap the grin off his face. He was looking at her smugly, almost as if he was enjoying the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly pulled away from him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to protest but she raised a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to tell me what&#39;s going on or not?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m about to tell you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy started but she narrowed her eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get to the point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then. You&#39;re in heat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heat?! What is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy ran a hand through his long silky hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I said, it&#39;s a natural occurrence. It only happens about four times in a year. And it&#39;s very common for female werewolves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Female werewolves?! Are you making a joke right now? Is this funny to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina asked and Remy shook his head, he looked dead serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not joking Valentina. You are a werewolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Werewolf. The word sounded foreign in her ears, but Remy made it clear that he was not joking and she had a feeling he wasn&#39;t either. He continued to tell her more unbelievable things, each one leaving her more in shock than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This heat period, how do I get out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked, still slightly unsure but not quite ready for another hot flash yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t. It can last for a few days. The symptoms you are experiencing now are very mild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You call this mild?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My whole body is on fire!!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I know. But unless you&#39;re ready to mate with me, you&#39;re just going to have to endure it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She glanced at Remy, shooting him a look that asked him to explain what the hell he was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy walked to the other side of the room, his cheeks were flushed with colour. They had never talked about this, at all. None of it. And now talking about it, it was uncomfortable to say the least, especially since he wanted her. So bad it physically hurt. His wolf was practically clawing at him to get close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heat period started at dinner, but she didn&#39;t know it then.  He could smell the scent she was giving off before anybody else and he fought hard to control himself, as it got stronger he made a beeline for her when he realised she was having symptoms of a hot flash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it means you&#39;ll have to sleep with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an uncomfortable silence between two of them. With Valentina notably silent and Remy standing and watching from the other side of the room. Her cheeks flushed as she realised what Remy meant. Oh hell no!!! She wasn&#39;t going to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to sleep with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ouch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But your wolf does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care what it wants. If it&#39;s even real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured to herself. She still didn&#39;t fully believe him, he didn&#39;t give her an entirely plausible explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, in the past... how did I get this over with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She timidly asked and Remy sighed...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you&#39;re asking the right questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, physical contact helps. My presence would calm you down a lot and your wolf will at least be sated. The only problem with that is that we literally have to be together every waking moment or else you would get flare ups.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Physical contact. Okay, that wasn&#39;t so bad. She could do that. She would be able to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Let&#39;s do that. You can sleep here for the meantime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you can stay a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy watched her quietly, face flushed, hands on her waist and he realised that there was something different about her. He wished he knew what it was, but ever since she had come back, he felt like he was dealing with an entirely different person. He knew the change in attitude was due to the memory loss, but the mannerisms, the way she talked, the way she looked at him, it was nothing like the Valentina he knew. That calm calculating look she always had on her face, it was gone and it had been gone for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He beckoned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come to bed then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said and he watched her crawl to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to hold you all night, so don&#39;t freak out or anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He warned and she nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you won&#39;t mind me taking off my shirt. I&#39;m a little hot too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina shook her head, her eyes firmly on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift movement, Remy pulled off his T-shirt, Valentina had the immense pleasure of looking at his powerful back and the tattoos that dotted his skin. She looked away for a bit, secretly feeling ashamed for even staring in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy caught her watching and smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s totally okay for you to feel attracted to me during this period. So don&#39;t be ashamed. You can look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you always so full of yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only around you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy climbed into bed, enveloping Valentina into his arms in the process, Valentina stood still, rigid while his arms were around her. It was a comforting kind of feeling, and he was right when he told her that she would feel much better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lay together silently, with thousands of things running through their minds,.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were we in love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina asked out of the blues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy was taken aback by the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What??!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked and she repeated the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no way of answering that. He couldn&#39;t answer it even if he tried. They were not in love, but he had hoped that they would be, that they would later fall in love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. No we weren&#39;t.&#34;</p>
