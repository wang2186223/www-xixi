                <p>&#34;Welcome!!! Welcome! It&#39;s so nice to see you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon said as he pulled Remy into a big hug. He was a short man, but he was stocky, still, Remy towered over him. With his big arms and his tall height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too Jaxon! It&#39;s beautiful this time of the year. Thank you for inviting us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said and Jaxon smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina could see Jaxon and  his Luna looking at her keenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who is the beautiful lady?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kinsley asked and Remy smiled and pulled her close, she tried not to look too shocked, instead she forced a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my mate and our Luna, Valentina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon and Kinsley exchanged a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They asked and Remy nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Yes I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow! This really calls for a celebration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon said as he laughed uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And congratulations on your heir. I know it&#39;s a happy occasion for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. It really is. We&#39;re so glad you could make it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kinsley replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please come in. It must be cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon led them out of the cold and into a small cabin that they would be inhabiting. He talked with Remy oustide while Valentina decided to settle in. Kale brought in their luggage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina stayed inside for a bit, watching the frozen wonderland from outside their bedroom window. From the little she had inspected the cabin was cozy. With two bedroom and one bathroom, they would spend a lot of time sharing a lot of things. Especially with Kale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On their way to the town, the snow-capped mountains, the vast stretches of tundra, and the icy blue lakes all took her breath away. And now as she looked outside the window she knew that she would find a way to enjoy her stay there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe hiking or something as simple as fishing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was willing to try it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least she&#39;d be able to have some fun. Remy had told her nothing as regards to why they were there. His answers had been vague and she had no strength to pursue the conversation. She would have, but she didn&#39;t even want to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was leaving very soon anyway, plotting and mapping out her escape route inside her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The best time and way for her to leave without even being noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy walked inside the room, his large frame made the room even look smaller and as he took off his jacket, Valentina quickly looked away. He had only worn some flimsy jacket and from what Ellen had told her werewolves were able to regulate their body heat, the cold wouldn&#39;t affect him, or Kale but it would affect her. They had bought winter clothes just as a precaution, but Valentina really needed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chill was the first thing to hit her as soon as she got off the plane. Thankfully, she had been prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry about earlier. But you know I had to make it real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already warned me. I wasn&#39;t too surprised.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied as she continue looking outside the window, waiting for him to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything okay with you Valentina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy asked in a very concerned tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to him and nodded her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything is fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..........</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later in the evening after she had put away her  luggage and changed into something equally comfortable, but still bulky, they had walked over to Jaxon and Kinsley&#39;s house. The two had invited them over for dinner, ahead of the festivities and Valentina heard a little history about the town. Majority of the inhabitants of the small town were wolves, the ones who weren&#39;t were fully aware that werewolves lived among them, but they preferred the proximity because it kept them safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon was alpha of his pack only because of his bloodline.  Jaxon&#39;s bloodline which was said to be the strongest, bred alphas. Each alpha had the task of creating a new alpha. And it was a cause for celebration when a baby was born to the alpha and his Luna, because they just secured their next in line and fulfilled their duty of continuing the bloodline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon&#39;s pack was mostly solitary, they kept to themselves, they rarely traveled or lived outside their habitat but they had their own strengths and they were a formidable ally to have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here. Have some more bread.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kinsley said as she passed the bread to Valentina for the second time. Her alpha shot her a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think our guest has had her fill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He murmured and she smiled at him lovingly. Then turned her attention back to Valentina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve barely touched your food. Are you not hungry? Is the food not to your liking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina forced a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it&#39;s really good. I&#39;ve had my fill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said as she pushed the plate away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for the meal. I&#39;m so glad you invited us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kinsley smiled warmly. She looked like a genuinely nice woman, but Valentina felt she might just be playing nice because she was nosy. She had been trying to strike a conversation with her all dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome. We don&#39;t get guests this often. So we&#39;re glad you could make it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On that topic, while I&#39;m grateful that you are here, I still can&#39;t help but wonder why you honored my invitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you doubt my good intentions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked and Jaxon shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. But I also know you&#39;re not coming all the way from LA to congratulate me on my newborn heir. Why is it you&#39;re here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina glanced at Remy. Well Jaxon did have a point, there was no way Remy wasn&#39;t coming all the way to Alaska for something else, something even he had not told her yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as they sat and ate their dinner, she knew there was no way Remy would be able to ignore the question, at least not without looking even more guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina&#39;s heart quickened at the thought of the fact that he would have no choice but to tell her what he came there for to her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, apart from the obvious, I think it&#39;s pretty obvious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered vaguely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon&#39;s eyes darted around the two of them. He looked like he was calculating and thinking and many things behind those inquisitive eyes of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve held on to the mantle for at least three years now. As it is our right to...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy nodded  as he wiped the corners of his mouth, finally letting go of his fork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. You&#39;re right. It is your right to. But as next in line to hold the mantle, one grows weary when rumors start to fly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were talking but Valentina could barely make out what they were talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t understand it at all, or why it was so important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon and Remy appeared to be in a very heated staring contest and Remy was winning. Jaxon&#39;s gaze had faltered at least twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What rumors are you talking about? We&#39;ve heard none of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon sounded mildly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you would say that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say what?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon fired back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deny the fact that you&#39;ve heard the rumors. It&#39;s not a very smart thing to do when your own Beta has been talking about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remy, why are you doing this? The mantle will pass to your pack after you&#39;ve met all the requirements. Are you scared you would never meet the requirements?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon&#39;s voice sounded mildly taunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy shot him a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not scared of that. I&#39;m not scared of anything. But I wonder exactly how free and fair this would be if you keep interfering with public opinion just to make the mantle stay with you a little longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think I have a hand in all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Jaxon, it&#39;s common knowledge that you wouldn&#39;t mind a little tussle in the snow. You like to play dirty, I&#39;m just wondering what your gain is in all this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I invite you to my house to celebrate and you level accusations at me. I do not take this lightly.&#34; He sounded slightly agitated and Remy looked amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not here to fight you Jaxon. We both know who would win. But, I am finally sick and tired of the mind games you&#39;ve been playing in the background.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh stop this madness Remington! You have no evidence of this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kinsley replied angrily, almost flinging her fork at Remy&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaxon looked ready to pounce at Remy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina looked at all of them, utterly and thoroughly confused on what exactly was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mantle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were they talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we should all calm down. We&#39;re supposed to be eating dinner...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina said quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s unruly to fight at the dinner table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured as she turned to Remy and touched his hand gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy smiled uneasily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry about that my love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said as he drew her in and kissed her on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
