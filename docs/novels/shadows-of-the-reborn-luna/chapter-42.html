                <p>Goldie awoke to the sound of a car engine, the gentle caress of a cool breeze on her skin, and a lingering sense of confusion that clung to her like mist. She struggled to sit up, her body feeling heavy and lethargic. How long has she been asleep?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valentina, don&#39;t push yourself,&#34; a concerned voice whispered beside her. It was Remy, he was seated next to her bedside,  his eyes filled with worry. &#34;You&#39;ve been out for hours. You must be very weak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie blinked, trying to clear the fog in her mind. Her memory was a jumbled mess, like pieces of a puzzle scattered across her consciousness. But one thing stood out - the Lunathion ritual. Last she could remember, they were dancing underneath the moonlight, she couldn&#39;t really remember much after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remy,&#34; Goldie rasped, her voice weak. &#34;The Lunathion ritual, do we still have a chance to finish it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy&#39;s brows furrowed, torn between his concern for her and the importance of the ritual. He had watched her religiously all night, worried that her condition would get worse. The healer had assured him that she would be fine, but she was exhausted and needed rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valentina, you&#39;re not well. I don&#39;t even care about the ritual right now. Your health is what matters right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie&#39;s heart swelled with emotion at Remy&#39;s words. He cared about the ritual, he knew the importance of the ritual and yet he still chose her over it. She reached out to him, her hand trembling as she cupped his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know how much the ritual means to you,&#34; she whispered, her eyes brimming with tears. &#34;I&#39;m really sorry that I couldn&#39;t complete it. I wish things had gone differently...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy smiled, his fingers gently brushing her cheek. &#34;You don&#39;t need to apologize. Let&#39;s focus on getting you better,&#34; he said softly. &#34;I just want you back on your feet very soon again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie nodded, feeling a sense of peace wash over her. She leaned in, pressing her lips to Remy&#39;s cheek in a gentle, reassuring kiss. Remy was surprised but he shot her a smile, she laid back on the bed, her eyes closing as she drifted into a light sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.......</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabel Fleming stood nervously at her daughter Lily Parson&#39;s doorstep. It had been days since they had seen each other, days since she had run away from the nursing home to attempt the spell that was supposed to bring back her granddaughter. Her heart was heavy with guilt for running away from her nursing home and worrying her daughter, she knew that her sister  Camilla must have reassured Lily when she came to visit, but she still felt very badly about her behavior. She took a deep breath and rang the doorbell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily Parson, her eyes puffy from all the crying she had been doing since she woke up in her daughter&#39;s room, answered the door. Her face lit up when she saw her mother standing there. &#34;Mom!&#34; she exclaimed, pulling her mother into a warm embrace. &#34;Why would you do that to me?! How could you leave without letting me know?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Nana&#39;s eyes as she hugged her daughter tightly. &#34;I&#39;ve missed you, Lily,&#34; she said softly. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry for leaving the nursing home like that, but like Camilla explained, there was something that I really needed to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily sighed. &#34;You&#39;re going to tell me all about this important task that made you run away from the nursing home. &#34; she said, leading her mother inside the house and into the cozy living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sat down on the couch, and Isabel looked around the house, surprised to see all the boxes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Lily with concern. &#34;Are you moving?! And what&#39;s wrong with you? You look like you&#39;ve just been crying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily took a deep breath, her eyes filled with sadness. &#34;Simon says he wants a divorce. He&#39;s packing his things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nana&#39;s heart sank as she listened to her daughter&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That bastard!!! At a time like this?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabel sounded furious, her rage only pushed Lily into tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said he stayed this long because of Goldie and tried to stay after her death but he couldn&#39;t do it anymore... he said he&#39;s been seeing someone else...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I lay my hands on that wretched man, I&#39;ll kill him. I&#39;ll kill him Lily! With my bare hands!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily wiped her tears slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squeezed her mother&#39;s hand gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just glad that you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabel squeezed Lily&#39;s hand back. &#34;I&#39;m here for you, Lily. Whatever you need, I&#39;ll always be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily managed a weak smile, grateful for her mother. &#34;Thank you, Mom. Your presence means the world to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of silence, Lily looked at her mother thoughtfully. &#34;Now that you&#39;re back, I&#39;ve been thinking. Instead of going back to the nursing home, why don&#39;t you come live with me? I could use the company, and I want to take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother&#39;s eyes welled up with tears of gratitude. &#34;Oh, Lily, that would mean so much to me. I would love to be with you, especially at a time like this... &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>........</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moon hung low in the sky as the private jet  descended upon the sprawling city of Los Angeles. Rafael Lucas peered out his windows as the wheels of the aircraft touched the runway, signaling his arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the plane taxied towards the gate, Rafael Lucas leaned back in his seat, a cigar clenched between his teeth. Smoke swirled around him, a fitting metaphor for the haze of danger that always seemed to follow him. His piercing blue eyes scanned the cityscape below, he was finally in LA. And he was there to take back what he owned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exiting the plane, he strode confidently through the runway, his presence drawing curious glances from those around him. He was met by his loyal men and a Rolls Royce that was waiting for him. He got into the car, at least two of his trusted men were already in the car, bowing slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, we finally have some news,&#34; one of them said, a sense of urgency in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rafael arched an eyebrow as he took another drag from his cigar. &#34;Tell me,&#34; he replied in a low, gravelly voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We found a message from the only werewolf who survived Valentina&#39;s brutal attack in that town.&#34; another one of his men  explained. &#34;She was working with a werewolf, he was the one who killed our men. An alpha named Remington Albrecht. We found out he was the one who picked her up in the hospital too. I suspect that they are mates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rafael&#39;s eyes narrowed. Valentina Combe was a name that stirred deep anger and hatred within him. She was a dangerous woman and she was even more dangerous as a werewolf. She had betrayed him, stole from him and he had been on the hunt for her ever since. This new man she had protecting her, whoever he was, he was only going to meet his end if he stuck with such a woman. Valentina Combe deserved nothing but death, right after he collected everything that she took from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the message?&#34; Rafael demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His man hesitated for a moment before speaking, his voice trembling slightly. &#34;He said he&#39;s coming for you. And he&#39;ll kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep growl rumbled in Rafael&#39;s chest as he crushed the cigar in his hand. Smoke curled around his fingers, and his men could feel the intensity of his rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valentina will pay for her sins,&#34; he snarled, his voice dripping with venom. &#34;And as for the Alpha who can&#39;t seem to mind his business, he will regret ever crossing my path.&#34;</p>
