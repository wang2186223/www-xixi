                <p>Goldie found herself in front of Valentina&#39;s art room. She hasn&#39;t been there in a while and she knew that it must have surprised everyone in the house that she was finally going back to check on it again, since it had looked so unfamiliar to her after she lost her memories. The art room stood like a forgotten relic, an air of melancholy hanging over it with several cobwebs and dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to find answers, Goldie cautiously entered the room. This room had answers, or at least it should have. If Valentina spent most of her time here, then there must be something her that can shed more light as to who she was as a person. Or what she did or who she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stepped into the room, she was once again reminded why she hated coming in. Valentina&#39;s drawings were gruesome to say the least. A truly disturbed mind and soul. The things she drew or thought about, Goldie didn&#39;t think it was normal to draw or even think about such things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie knew she couldn&#39;t waste any time. She began searching through the drawers and the small shelves, looking for any clues that might reveal what had led to Valentina&#39;s untimely &#39;demise&#39; that brought her to the morgue in the first place. Her death was the most unexplained part about her. No one knew why she died, or how she died or if she had been sick or anything. The doctor couldn&#39;t even give an explanation. And if Goldie was currently inhabiting Valentina&#39;s body, did that make Valentina dead dead?! Or was her soul somewhere still in her lurking somewhere?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had so many burning questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And not one answer to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could it be about?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was a treasure trove of art supplies, but Goldie&#39;s focus was on finding answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the canvases and brushes, she stumbled upon a small, weathered journal. Its pages were yellowed with age, and its leather cover was worn. Gingerly, Goldie opened it and started to read Valentina&#39;s handwritten notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The journal contained a cryptic collection of names and numbers, locations, written in a hurried, almost frantic script. It was as if Valentina had been documenting something, but the meaning remained elusive. What was she documenting?! What were the names ?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie couldn&#39;t decipher the purpose of these entries, but she was certain they held a key to understanding Valentina&#39;s secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With trembling hands, she carefully tucked the journal into the pocket of her jacket, determined to unravel the mystery it held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.......</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was afternoon, Remy received a call that disrupted his peaceful routine. He had thought he would spend the day training in the gym, but he got a call from a partner in Malibu who wanted to buy a house. An important meeting in the bustling city required his immediate attention. Goldie was in the room, and she  watched as Remy dressed in his sharp suit, his face a mixture of excitement and worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked hopefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Malibu.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy replied as he started packing a suitcase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose from the bed. All she could think about was the fact that she would see the beach. She wanted to see the beach. She could use a break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll enjoy it very much. It&#39;s a boring ass meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind. I just need to get out of here for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy gave her a pointed look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a beach house in Malibu. If you promise to stay there and not cause any trouble while I conduct business in the city, then you can come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie jumped up happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that settled, they set off in Remy&#39;s car, the wind in their faces as they cruised down the winding coastal road. The city&#39;s skyscrapers loomed in the distance, a stark contrast to the tall long trees that she was used to seeing everyday in Remy&#39;s mansion. Eventually, they arrived at a charming beach house nestled by the shore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy parked the car and Goldie ran out onto the sandy beach, her bag in her hand. She looked at the beach house from afar and smiled back at Remy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The beach house has everything you need. I&#39;ll be back in a couple of hours. Please don&#39;t do anything stupid Valentina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll call you every hour to check up on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said as he pulled out his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie nodded, barely listening to him and just looking out at sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally turned back and waved to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Remy drove away, Goldie explored her surroundings. The beach house was surrounded by lush gardens and overlooked the sparkling sea. She walked around the sandy shore, picking up sea shells she would find every now and then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, she encountered Dalia, a friendly golden retriever who seemed to have wandered from the other side of the beach. She saw the name of the dog on her collar while she petted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Dalia!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dalia greeted Goldie with a wagging tail and a playful bark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They quickly became fast friends, running along the shore, chasing seagulls, and splashing in the gentle waves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the day unfolded, Goldie and the dog  Dalia frolicked in the sun, enjoying each other&#39;s company. They rolled in the sand, Goldie wished she had treats to give the dog but she didn&#39;t have anything suitable. The dog had truly been a blessing. She had forgotten all about her worries as she reveled in the unexpected day at the beach house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the sun began its descent, a woman who she perceived to be Dalia&#39;s owner returned to pick her up. She reluctantly said her goodbyes to Dalia, promising to visit again soon.  The woman was thankful that Goldie had keeper her dog company, but what she didn&#39;t know that it was the dog that had kept her company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.......</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to uncover the truth, Marielle tracked down the witch who had mysteriously left her with a vague message that she knew Valentina Combe. The witch, whose name was Madame Eloise Grant was apparently a well known witch in New Orleans. She claimed to be a direct descendant of the early Salem witches and she publicly claimed that she was a witch. While humans might have not taken such a woman too seriously, Marielle knew that she was revered and considered powerful in the supernatural world. She had heard tales of her mystical powers and her deep connection to the hidden realms of magic. After much persistence and searching, Marielle finally secured an important phone call with Madame Eloise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The witch&#39;s voice was as enchanting as the tales that surrounded her. &#34;And who are you?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marielle Mason. You may not know me, but I have heard about you. And I need something from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it you seek, child?&#34; she inquired, her words a delicate dance of secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle, not one to beat around the bush, went straight to the heart of the matter. &#34;Madame Eloise, I saw your message, even though you didn&#39;t leave me a name to find you. You said you know about a woman named Valentina Combe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a short silence. The witch didn&#39;t speak, but Marielle continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said she came to you for something quite unusual and that you knew of her in a way. Can you elaborate on that? What did she come for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pregnant pause on the other end of the line, and then Madame Eloise asked very slowly. &#34;Do you know her? Do you know Valentina Combe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle knew the woman was unwilling to tell her what she wanted. She would have to be more straightforward then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do. From the message you sent, you were trying to contact Valentina Combe, well I won&#39;t tell you much, but I will tell you that I have direct access to Valentina Combe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Madame Eloise quickly answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t give out information of my clients so easily. If I did, it would make me very untrustworthy. But of course, if I get a little incentive, I might reconsider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Valentina was Madame Eloise&#39;s client?! But for what?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle knew it would come down to money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Name your price Madame Eloise. I will have my boss wire you enough money for you to reconsider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have my word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added and Madame Eloise scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What good is your word?! Humans break their promises all the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not human Madame Eloise. Neither was Valentina Combe. I&#39;m sure you already know that already if you were in contact with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another silence, Marielle grew impatient. Madame Eloise asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what pack are you from? Marielle Mason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Silverback pride of Alpha Remington Albrecht. You may have heard of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahhhh! The pack forever cursed to be without a luna?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle winced. Well, at least she knew who they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well. Valentina Combe came to me for a concealment spell, one that could hide the true location and identity of someone or something  for years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle&#39;s curiosity grew with each word. &#34;A concealment spell? But why would she need something like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Madame Eloise&#39;s voice became stern, and Marielle could feel the weight of her words. &#34;That, my dear, is another secret worth its weight in gold. I&#39;m afraid even money cannot make me divulge that to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle hesitated, but her desire for the truth overpowered her reservations. &#34;Very well, how long ago was this?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been going for a year now. She renews the spell every month to make it stronger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?! is the spell still active?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Madame Eloise replied simply, sending shivers down Marielle&#39;s spine. &#34;I&#39;ve been paid every month to ensure its longevity. Although, two months ago she gave me a three month advance for the spell. We haven&#39;t had any contact since then and I&#39;m afraid if she doesn&#39;t pay up after the next month I might have to discontinue the spell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two months ago. That was before Valentina lost her memories, that was before whatever accident she had that landed her in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Valentina know that such would happen to her?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she orchestrate all this?!</p>
