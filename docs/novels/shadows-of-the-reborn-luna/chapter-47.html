                <p>Goldie and Remy stood in hushed concern beside Ellen&#39;s bed, watching as the healer examined her. They had managed to arrive in time, but the report was still more or less the same. Ellen&#39;s body had healed, but she was still very weak. Ellen lay pale and still on the large bed, her breaths shallow and weak. Her flowery room was filled with the sterile scent of herbs and the sound of the healer talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie couldn&#39;t really remember his name, but she knew he was the one who treated her the last time after she had fainted after the lunathion ritual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The healer, an elderly man with a kind face and steady hands, finally broke the silence. &#34;She has lost a substantial amount of blood from the deep gash in her side.&#34; he explained gravely. &#34;Her body healed too slowly after the fall because she was knocked unconscious, so the blood loss was a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy nodded, his brow furrowed in worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard. Does she need medical attention or will she heal slowly on her own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The healer studied Ellen for a moment before responding. &#34;I suggest speeding up her healing process. She needs a transfusion to replenish her blood supply quickly. I suggest taking her to the hospital for a sterile blood transfer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy nodded again. &#34;We&#39;ll get her there as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The healer nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll prepare some of our men to carry her to the car. You can take some of her essentials along with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie murmured as she stood up looking at the healer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her closet is right there. Just pick a few things you know she&#39;d need for an overnight stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy murmured, barely tearing his eyes away from his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie moved swiftly to pack Ellen&#39;s things. Remy watched her as she moved quickly. He didn&#39;t ask for her help, yet she had willingly offered it, all through the ride home she had been just as worried as he was, but she managed to comfort him and even tried to get his mind off it. He was a little surprised by how quickly she had sprung into action, but he was very grateful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while she came out of the closet with a bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remy, I&#39;ll go with you. Do you need anything? I can help you pack too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy smiled gratefully at Goldie, appreciating her help.  &#34;Thank you. I&#39;ll take her to the car.&#34; He turned back to the healer. &#34;We&#39;ll be back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they also went to pack their bags. Goldie had selected warm blankets, water, and some food, as well as a change of clothes for Ellen. For herself, she selected a change of clothes and some toiletries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they finished packing, Kale came in to check on them, Remy gave him a brief update.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be praying for her quick recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. I want you to stay and take charge. We&#39;ll be back tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale nodded in agreement, a determined glint in his eyes. &#34;Your mother is strong. She&#39;ll be well in no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy didn&#39;t comment on that, he only nodded and walked away. One could tell he was still very worried about his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale on the other hand turned to Goldie, a smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valentina please take care of him. I know he acts all tough and strong but he&#39;s really very anxious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will. Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the bags  in their hand,  Remy and Goldie left Ellen&#39;s room, ready to go to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...........</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy mentioned that they weren&#39;t going to a regular hospital.  It was private hospital with a reputation for treating werewolves like Remy and apparently the owner of the hospital was also a member of Remy&#39;s pack. The sun had already set, and the moon was on the rise, casting an eerie glow over the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor and owner of the hospital was the first person to welcome them. He was waiting outside the hospital with his staff who helped him wheel Ellen into the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor greeted as he bowed a little. Goldie watched in fascination as the man bowed to Remy. The word Alpha on his lips sounded like a worship, a deep reverence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard about the situation. We&#39;ve prepped her for a blood transfusion. Will you be the donor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor asked and Remy nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will. This is my Luna Valentina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Goldie. The doctor&#39;s eyes travelled to her and she could see the admiration that shone in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man exclaimed as he rushed towards her, his hands outstretched to touch hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is Dr Daniel Brooke. I&#39;m a loyal pack member. I&#39;m sorry we haven&#39;t had a chance to meet, I work late nights so work keeps me away from pack meetings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie smiled warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright Dr Brooke. It&#39;s nice to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor nodded and turned to Remy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s prep you for the procedure. We have all the time to catch up later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor said as he ushered them in. In the hospital, Remy was led to the private theatre immediately, with Ellen in tow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Remy and Ellen preoccupied, Goldie decided to venture down the hospital hallway in search of some much-needed coffee. They would run some tests before starting to transfusion, she didn&#39;t know how long it would take but she decided it was best to get some coffee. So she could stay awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t get any sleep on the plane, she was too worried, Remy also didn&#39;t get enough sleep, his eyes were open the whole time even though it was a short flight. They had arrived home and gone back on the road again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The aroma of fresh brew led her to the hospital cafeteria, where she hoped to find a hot cup of strong coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw the coffee machine from afar and was venturing towards it when she saw a familiar face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart skipped a beat. She looked around and looked at him again to be sure that he was the one. He was, he was standing right in front of the coffee machine, his eyes at that faraway look in his eyes. He was dressed in a dark blue suit, he looked like he had just got off work. He was still staring far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie took a deep breath before approaching him. She knew it was the worst possible timing, but Colin was her friend, they were once the best of friends. And she missed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met as she stood in front of the coffee machine and Colin gave her a short smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her again, as if he recognised her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey. It&#39;s you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said. Oh his voice, Goldie blinked away tears, hard tears. Don&#39;t cry, don&#39;t cry. She told herself as she managed a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You gave up your spot so I could see the doctor before you in Oak Creek. Valentina right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered her, but not as Goldie. He would never remember her as Goldie, not even she was wearing someone else&#39;s face. Goldie returned his greeting. &#34;Colin Lockwood right? What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin took a sip of his coffee before responding, &#34;Remember those nightmares I used to have? Well there&#39;s a specialist here who can help me with my nightmares... I made an appointment and decided to come see him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie nodded, recalling the conversation they had shared that time at the cafe. He was having nightmares, about her. At least that was what he told her.  She wondered if anyone else close to her was suffering the same fate, forever tormented by dreams of her. She herself suffered from the same nightmares. The real Valentina it seemed, had no plans of leaving her alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And was he helpful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin&#39;s expression dimmed. &#34;Actually, I haven&#39;t seen him yet, but I&#39;m optimistic. He came highly recommended so I wanted to see him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie felt deeply for Colin. She could only imagine what he was going through, having to deal with nightmares every night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mean to pry, but is it still the same nightmare? The one with your friend Goldie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Every night I see her... it&#39;s the same thing I guess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie just couldn&#39;t understand. Why was Colin having nightmares about her?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it because a part of him suspected that she was still alive?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Colin... can I talk to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and he looked a bit confused before nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yea sure. Let&#39;s find a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led her to the closest table and chair, Goldie sat facing him, her hands shaking in anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she was about to tell him, there was only one way he would take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could either believe her, or tell her to fuck off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath and told him a memory that only the two of them shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It happened around late July, five years ago. We were in my room, we just settled after having a huge fight about you going to MIT and me going to UCLA.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin leaned forward, his brow furrowing in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tried to beg you to stay, you said you wanted to go for away since I wasn&#39;t sure I would ever feel the same way you felt for me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valentina...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie continued, tears blurring her vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone called you, you said it was your mother, you stood up to leave and I stood up and pulled you closer. I kissed you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a morbid silence as Goldie looked at Colin&#39;s face pale face, searching his eyes for any emotion, any emotion at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know that??&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You pulled away first, then you asked me if I loved you. I didn&#39;t reply to that, you waited for me to reply... I didn&#39;t even know what to say...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked you again. You didn&#39;t reply, I opened the door and left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie nodded, tears blurring her vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked for the second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie smiled. I remembered the nickname I used to call him when we were much younger, Colonel Sanders. It was my personal nickname for him all through middle school. He hated it, but I loved it, I only stopped when we reached high school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious Colonel Sanders?!&#34;</p>
