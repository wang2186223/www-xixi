                <p>She had settled down for a nap and the girl had come again. The curly headed girl with the vivid green eyes. This time, she stood in front of her, she could see her body and not just her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina felt a sort of familiarity with her. A sort of kindred. Like she knew her, from somewhere but she didn&#39;t know where. What if the girl was somehow connected to her, how she lost her memory and why she was in the hospital. She wondered if that was it. If that was the reason why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered who she was. And why she would not stop appearing in her dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl looked young, early twenties or her late teens. She had a perfectly round face, big doe eyes and Cupid bow lips. She was wearing a dress, shimmery, gold and short, it stopped at her slim thighs. Her hair framed her face perfectly, she was staring at Valentina with those piercing green eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then she raised her hand, this time Valentina did not scream, she only watched her, her hands touched Valentina&#39;s shoulder and Valentina opened her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light washed in quickly and she closed her eyes as quickly as she opened them. She had left the blinds closed, who opened them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought as she sat up on the bed and slowly opened her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy walked out of the closet, with a shirt in his hands. He looked surprised to see her awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry just came to pick up some clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned at him in annoyance, her sleep had been cut short, she had wondered what would have happened if she touched the girl but all she did was wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you open the blinds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured and he pointed to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was dark and I didn&#39;t want to turn on the lights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed as she sat upright, she pulled her hair out of her face, she was pretty sure it was sticking out of her head in all places because of how short it was, that was what she had to deal with recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy asked and she nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m only asking because you were stirring in your sleep. Bad dream?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going to reply, then she remembered how she had found her phone in his study and she had wondered what it was doing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were you doing with my phone?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fired and he paused for a bit. He looked a little confused, then his eyes widened in recognition and he nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ohhh... wait... why were you in my study?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you answering my question with a question?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fired back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The study&#39;s off limits. Even to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But my phone isn&#39;t?! Why were you touching it?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy shot her a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw it lying around and picked it up with the hopes of giving it back to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a lie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accused and Remy narrowed his eyes at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have absolutely no interest in your phone. Believe me. I saw it when it was ringing and I meant to give you but you already left with Marielle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must have taken it to my study by mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He explained as he rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina was still a little skeptical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t believe me, but in the future stay out of my study. There&#39;s a lot of sensitive stuff there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The door to your study was opened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina said. Why was he asking about the stupid study?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing but old books and dusty figurines in the study anyways. Nothing more than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s strange. It&#39;s always closed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy murmured as he folded his shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina raised her eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what are you insinuating?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and he shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve set up an appointment with the specialist. She has an opening tomorrow morning. We have to leave this evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re taking a flight, so we&#39;ll be able to meet up with her appointment in the morning and also get some rest. So pack your stuff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina asked and Remy nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the rush?! I thought you said the full moon is coming soon?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is. But you still have to see the specialist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still haven&#39;t explained to me why you&#39;re rushing this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said as she folded her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want you to get better soon? Is that too much to ask??&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better soon?! It&#39;s not like we were in love before or anything so why are you so eager about me getting back my memories?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked with a pointed look and Remy sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rubbed his temples slowly then he looked at her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because the pack depends on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack depends on it? What does that mean? Valentina mulled over Remy&#39;s words all the way to the airport. She didn&#39;t understand what he meant by saying that the pack depended on her memories. She wondered how that fit or how it made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They arrived late at night, and Remy mentioned something about them lodging in an hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was tired from the flight, she didn&#39;t even mind that they were going to lodge in an hotel, or anywhere, she just wanted somewhere to sleep. For the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They arrived at a motel an hour later, a driver had dropped them off there. Valentina waited at the lobby and stared at her shoes while Remy talked to the woman at the receptionist desk. They seemed to be having a serious and lengthy conversation. She was almost tempted to go meet them and ask what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Few moments later Remy came back with a frown on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re booked for the night. They only have one room left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina raised her eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re joking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it at least a  double bed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked him and he shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Single.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll sleep on the floor then. Or couch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She muttered as she walked past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was really tired. She just wanted to sleep. Not only had he just dragged her for the impromptu trip, now he also didn&#39;t properly plan where they would stay for the night and they had to manage the motel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well at least she had somewhere to stay for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was clean. Clean room, clean rugs and a nice sofa at the side. It was comfortable enough for the two of them. And the bathroom was covered in white tiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Room service has delivered a couple of towels for them.  Valentina intended to have a brief shower before bed. The bed was simple, thick white sheets, with fluffy pillows and a flowery duvet. She liked it a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take a shower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured as she walked straight into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy grunted in reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let herself be immersed in the hot water that washed all over her. She pondered on everything that had happened again and wondered why it was so important for her to regain her memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy had told her that it was for the good of the pack, but she couldn&#39;t decipher the true meaning behind his statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She at least hoped that the specialist they met would be able to help her in some way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hopefully she would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She changed back into her clothes in the bathroom after drying up, then went back to the room and snuggled up underneath the thick duvet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy sat on the couch brooding, his huge frame took up at least half of the couch, Valentina wondered if it was a good idea letting him sleep in such a small and confined space. She felt a little bad for him, he wouldn&#39;t be comfortable sleeping there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you be okay over there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally asked timidly. Remy raised his eyebrows, he looked like he was surprised that she had even asked the question in the first place</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told the question surprised her equally too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t tell why she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ll be awake for a while&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and Remy glanced around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll keep watch. Try and get some rest. We&#39;re waking up quite early tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded in reply and settled back into the covers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he wanted to stay up all night then fine. That shouldn&#39;t be any of her business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay then. Suit yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured as she settled into the covers. Minutes later, she drifted into sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, her dream was different. The blond haired girl didn&#39;t visit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was in a car, with a group of friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were singing loudly, the radio was blasting cheesy pop song and she was singing along with them too, but she was looking out the window, enjoying the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She liked the wind blowing on her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for a brief moment, she looked at the rear view mirror and caught a glimpse of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Green eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blonde hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she was the blonde haired girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina woke up in a cold sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was panting softly. She looked at the wall clock on the wall, the light in the room was dim but she could still make out the hands of the clock. It was past three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the corner, Remy&#39;s eyes was closed. He didn&#39;t stir. He looked like he was fast asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This dream was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like a memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the face in the mirror, the face of that girl she had seen, she was wearing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had the face on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was the girl?!</p>
