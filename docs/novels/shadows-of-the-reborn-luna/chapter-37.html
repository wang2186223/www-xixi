                <p>After their adventurous day at the beach, they were finally back home, safe and sound. Goldie was feeling much better and she was already back to her usual self, thanks to Remy. She had regained all strength and consciousness the moment they left the beach house and went on the long ride home. And  Goldie couldn&#39;t deny that while she had wanted to leave the house, she missed it while she was away. So when they arrived at the front gates with the tall familiar trees and brooding forest, it strangely felt like home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she felt even more at ease than ever. Ellen had been fussy as usual, she had begged Remy not to mention the nightmare incident so he wouldn&#39;t worry her and she was thankful that he had kept it to himself. He didn&#39;t mention it to her. Ellen was just happy that they were back home as she hurried and made dinner plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie went upstairs to take a shower and change into comfortable clothes, on her way back downstairs he overheard a heated conversation coming from Remy&#39;s study. Curiosity piqued, she quietly crept to the door, her ears tuned in to the voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t expect me to wait forever!&#34; Remy&#39;s voice was firm, filled with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other person&#39;s voice was deep and stern, she had a feeling he must be an alpha. &#34;Alpha Remington, you&#39;re asking for far more than you&#39;re owed. We&#39;ve already made concessions, and you know your pack&#39;s situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie&#39;s heart ached for Remy as she listened to the tense exchange. She knew that Remy had been trying to get back the mantle ever since their trip to Alaska. He just wanted to make sure that the seat of power reached their pack, but their opinions and reservations about his pack prevented them from acting objectively or fairly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call ended, Remy came out of the study, his face etched with worry. He looked up and saw her watching him. Goldie looked up at him, her eyes filled with concern. &#34;Remy, what&#39;s going on? You look so stressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed, standing in front of her. &#34;It&#39;s just... pack politics.... That&#39;s all it is. That&#39;s all it&#39;s ever been. Don&#39;t worry yourself Valentina, you should go get something to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie thought for a moment, then looked at Remy with a determined glint in her eyes. &#34;Remy, I want to help. I&#39;ll perform the Lunathion ritual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy&#39;s brows furrowed with concern, he quickly shook his head. &#34;Valentina, I can&#39;t ask you to do that. I know it&#39;s what I always wanted but I don&#39;t want you to feel pressured into doing it. I&#39;m more than capable of navigating all this on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her hand gently on his, silently savoring the toasty warmth of his skin. &#34;Remy, it&#39;s the least I can do for you after everything you&#39;ve done for me. I know I could never repay you for saving my life, but I want you to know that I want to do this, no matter what it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock bloomed in Remy&#39;s eyes as he looked at her, overwhelmed by her selflessness and sacrifice. &#34;Valentina, the Lunathion ritual... there&#39;s something I haven&#39;t told you about it&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy struggled with his words as he slowly cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well... because it&#39;s a ritual between the alpha and its Luna, it is generally assumed that the Luna and alpha are mates and therefore married in the werewolf community...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said as she nodded, urging him to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Lunathion ritual ends with the alpha and Luna consummating the ritual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..........</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily Parson sat in the cozy living room of their suburban home, her fingers nervously tapping on the armrest of her chair. The evening sun cast warm, golden hues across the room, but the news she had just received had left her feeling cold and anxious. Her mother had left the nursing home again, the second time this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it&#39;s been a few hours also, the nursing home had only told her just in case Nana came home, but Lily knew the opposite would happen. After what happened the last time, she doubted that her mother would confide in her. Maybe she shouldn&#39;t have harshly talked to her. But she was tired. Nana was the only one who refused to come to terms with Goldie&#39;s death. And it was exhausting hearing her talk about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Simon, we need to talk,&#34; she called out to her husband, who was in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon Parson, a tall man with graying hair, entered the room with a puzzled expression. &#34;Is there something wrong? I leave in a few minutes for a tennis match with a client.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily took a deep breath, her voice trembling as she spoke. &#34;It&#39;s about Nana, Simon. She&#39;s done it again. She&#39;s run away from the nursing home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon sighed, frustration evident in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The nursing home wanted me to stay home for a while to see if she comes here. But I doubt she will. We should go out and look for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lily, your mother is becoming a real menace. This is the second time this month. I&#39;m tired of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily&#39;s heart sank as she realized the toll her mother&#39;s actions were taking on their marriage. It had been a difficult few weeks, with her mother&#39;s deteriorating health and constant escapades. She mustered the courage to speak her mind. &#34;I know. I know it&#39;s tiring... but she&#39;s also dealing with everything and well... age hasn&#39;t made it easier for her. It&#39;s up to us to help her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon looked at her, a weighty silence hanging in the air. Then, he dropped a bombshell that shattered Lily&#39;s world. &#34;Lily, there&#39;s something I need to confess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily asked, not ready for the bombshell that her husband was going to drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been seeing someone else. Before Goldie died, I found comfort in another woman. I only stayed because of what happened to our daughter, but I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t keep up the act anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily&#39;s eyes welled up with tears, a mixture of shock, betrayal, and anger flooding her heart. She felt like the ground had been ripped from beneath her feet. &#34;How could you, Simon? After everything we&#39;ve been through, especially after losing Goldie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon looked remorseful, his voice filled with regret. &#34;I know it&#39;s unforgivable, Lily, but I was drowning in sorrow. I thought I could find happiness elsewhere. I tried so hard to stay for Goldie, but she&#39;s gone now, and I can&#39;t really keep pretending anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily couldn&#39;t contain her anger any longer. Her emotions boiled over, and she screamed at her husband. &#34;Get out, Simon! Just get out of here!&#34;</p>
