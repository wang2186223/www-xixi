                <p>I asked him as I stared at him. He had pulled me out of the party, right after Karl Schweers had just asked me to dance. I didn&#39;t say yes yet, but Karl had been eying me all night and he was pretty easy on the eyes. Any girl would want to dance with Karl. Any girl would, so I should want him to dance with me too, should I not?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyways, instead of that, I am outside with Colin, who has pulled me out of the party despite the harsh chilly weather, to tell me that he wasn&#39;t going to attend, to give me news that I had never thought of hearing. We had applied to UCLA together. What did he mean by he got accepted to MIT?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m saying, they have a great technology program.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin said soberly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we agreed we&#39;ll go to UCLA. Isn&#39;t that what we&#39;ve always talked about?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! That&#39;s what you have always talked about, I&#39;ve always told you I&#39;m keeping my options open.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears clouded my vision but I quickly blinked them away. I cried way too easily, but I didn&#39;t understand what Colin was saying, I didn&#39;t understand why he was changing his words now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told me he wanted to go to UCLA with me and now he was making it seem as if I had made the decision for the both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never said that Colin. At least not to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well now you know. Have fun in UCLA with Karl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my eyebrows and scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Karl?! Is that what this is all about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pretend I don&#39;t know what? What the fuck was he saying?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin started walking away, I held his arm and pulled him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come back here Colin Lockwood and tell me exactly what you mean!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goldie leave me alone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin protested but I didn&#39;t leave him alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Know what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped, slowly getting impatient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only said I was going to UCLA because of you, because I wanted to see you. Because I&#39;ve been in love with you all my life and I thought you&#39;d finally see it one day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All those letters you found in your locker were from me, I was the secret admirer who kept sending them to you but no! You thought they came from stupid Karl Schweers. And I have to admit, after years and years of pining after you, I&#39;m tired Goldie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t do this anymore! Not in college, not as adults, I&#39;ll rather let you go now and save what&#39;s left of my stupid heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he snatched his hand and walked away. I stood in the school lawn, my mouth opened, I was too stunned to speak, too stunned to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin Lockwood was in love with me?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.................</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina&#39;s eyes fluttered open. She thought she had been dreaming, but it was only another memory. She looked around, the room was dimly lit, the curtains had been closed to stop the light from filtering in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy was lying next to her, his amber eyes were looking at her with worry. He looked concerned. She tried to move but pain shot up her entire body so she quickly paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move. It still hurts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed as she struggled to speak, but her throat felt parched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Water?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy asked and she nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy picked up the glass of water on the bedside table, with one hand, he propped Valentina up carefully and put the glass to her lips. She took two mouthfuls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set the cup down and put her back on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked softly and she shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had us all worried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy said as he sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She muttered, trying to gather her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you run away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy asked and she stayed mute. She didn&#39;t have an answer for that. She was still stuck in her own head. After the altercation they had left the town, stopping briefly at the hospital before they left to make sure that nothing was broken, Valentina kept slipping in and out of consciousness while muttering jargons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy had been worried she had broken something but the doctor kept assuring her that medically, everything was fine, so he brought her back home. His mother had been so relieved when he did, the whole pack had been on high alerts ever since she was missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never mind that. Do you know the men that kidnapped you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I was walking down the alley and they grabbed me. They kept asking me strange questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy asked and Valentina shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They kept saying I took something from them. They sounded like they knew me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you don&#39;t remember them right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, luckily you didn&#39;t break anything. The healer said after one night of bedrest you&#39;d be fine. So don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for finding me Remy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied softly. Remy looked like there was a lot on his mind that he wanted to say, but he held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have some paperwork to do in the study, but you can call me if you need anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mother was worried sick about you, when you&#39;re feeling a little stronger you should stop by her room. Say hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina swallowed hard. How the hell was she going to face Ellen after everything she had done?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy stroked her head lightly, his fingers large and warm to the touch, she closed her eyes, savouring the sensation. Few seconds later, he walked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina slowly got out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of the mirror, she stared at her new self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not Valentina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was Goldie, Goldie Parson and her body had died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman in front of her was not her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was such a stark difference between the two of them, she thought as she looked closely. She had never imagined that she would be looking at herself through the eyes of someone else&#39;s body. Her curly blonde hair that she had struggled with all her life was gone, replaced by pin straight short black hair. Not a single curl in place, no need for her to worry about the hair been frizzy or how long she had to spend styling her hair just so she would get the perfect defined curls. She would never have to use a diffuser again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her green eyes were gone, replaced with baby blue eyes, the stuck out in her sharp features, sharp cheekbones, sharp chin with a pointed nose. She looked older, none of the softness or roundness her old face had. Or the freckles on her cheeks. It was all just smooth pale skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was slender too, she thought as she slowly took off her shirt. Slender and taller. Her arms were covered with tiny light scars all over. She wondered if the real Valentina used to self harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was different and she wasn&#39;t sure it was a difference she liked. Or would ever like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this to be her new life? Living as the elusive Valentina Combe who was married to an alpha and had a dark and mysterious that seemed to haunt her?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this her new life?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked herself, tears gathering in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even her voice was not her own. Everything wasn&#39;t hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all too much, she thought as she rushed out of the bathroom, putting her shirt back on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone was on the bed, she pulled it out and typed in a quick google search.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Goldie Parson, Oak Creek.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Numerous pictures and news articles came up, all of them talking about one thing, the accident. The tragic accident that had killed four young adults. Her chest constricted in pain as she read the news, her eyes skimming over the pages in record breaking speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was one local news site  that had pictures from her funeral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clicked it with shaky hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mom, her dad. They were there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces solemn, their expression guarded. One could easily see that her mother had been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left the site and typed in the family phone number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just had to hear her mother&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all she needed, even if it was going to be for the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just one more time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call went through and started ringing, she bit her nails nervously, worried it was going to go to voicemail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But someone finally picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her mother. And Goldie almost cried out in relief, but she held herself, covering her mouth with her hand as she tried to control the sob that was threatening to burst through her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could not reply. Who would she say she was? How would she introduce herself?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goldie?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother asked, with her voice breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bear it anymore, she ended the call.</p>
