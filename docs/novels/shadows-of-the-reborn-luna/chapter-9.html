                <p>Marielle helped with her hair. In the bathroom, Valentina sat in front of the mirror, while Marielle stood in front of her, her eyes alert and focused. Marielle worked quickly, her fingers quick, like the hands of a professional. They didn&#39;t talk much, the only sound that could be heard was the scissors and Marielle shuffling around. Few minutes later, Valentina came out looking much better, with a better hair cut. She stared at it in awe while Marielle dusted the hair from her dress and her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured as she ran a hand through the dark strands. Something about her hair felt strangely foreign to her, like she was touching someone else&#39;s hair.  It didn&#39;t entirely feel like her hair, it felt foreign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s no problem. I couldn&#39;t leave you with hair so choppy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina smiled a little. Marielle was nice and she felt comfortable around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, are you a friend of Remy&#39;s?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and Marielle nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. We practically grew up together. We&#39;ve known each other for years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But don&#39;t you worry. We&#39;re not close that way if that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added, smiling uneasily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina didn&#39;t think they were, but she found it interesting that they had been friends for so long. She wondered how Marielle had coped with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two women left the bathroom and Marielle called someone to clean up the hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle talked about her trip to New York while they walked down the hallways and Valentina instantly felt comfortable with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she talked she didn&#39;t even expect Valentina to reply, which was a relief because she didn&#39;t know what to say. She just felt better listening to her than talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale said as he found them in the hallway. He was wearing a simple white T-shirt and a baseball hat, he briefly pulled away his eyes from his phone to look at the impossible sight. Marielle and Valentina actually getting along!!!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe you two are actually getting along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am equally surprised but I&#39;m happy we finally are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina glanced at the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait. We don&#39;t get along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle laughed uneasily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just say, we&#39;re not the best of friends. You were always so quiet and withdrawn and you found me loud and obnoxious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re loud and obnoxious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle smiled but her smile didn&#39;t reach her eyes.  She looked touched but she was not convinced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, but that&#39;s not what you said when you saw me a month ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale folded his arms in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I like this new version of you, let&#39;s hope you stay that way when your memories come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Marielle gave him a look and they seemed to share a quiet look in their eye that she couldn&#39;t decipher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ll step outside for a walk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina said as she walked past the two of them. Eager to get some fresh air. On the way, she saw Mr Chops and she cuddled him and played with him for a while before leaving for the garden. The mansion was huge and the garden happened to be one of her favourite places about it. The way the plants were arranged, the little fountain in the middle of it all and the fresh smell of flowers and clean air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was learning more and more about herself everyday, but each layer she uncovered only leaves her more confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did she like to draw such weird stuff?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why didn&#39;t she get along with Marielle? Even though Marielle seemed like a perfectly nice and sensible human being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why didn&#39;t she get along with the dog?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all felt strange to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished there was a way to recover her memories soon enough so she would be able to understand herself better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy watched Valentina from a distance. He saw her when she rushed out of the house and into the garden. Her hair was looking better now, It was even and straight, Marielle had done a very good job of making it even. She walked around the garden, with her dress blowing in the wind and strands of her dark hair blowing in her face. Her expression was unreadable but he could tell that something weighed heavy on her mind. He wished she would open up to him, one of these days but she treated him like he was the enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was surprised when Kale had walked up to him and told him that he found Marielle and Valentina talking. They were getting along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was interesting to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And see, but it was still a bit weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heard footsteps and turned, Marielle appeared, a demure smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be resting after such a long journey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I could rest. But there&#39;s a lot to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had changed into a loose and casual dress, with fluffy slippers matching the colour of her bonnet. She stood next to him, they were inches away from each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could see the bags under her eyes, despite her bright and radiant face. She needed to rest. She was on a flight for a little over six hours, he was pretty sure she was jetlagged. There would be plenty of time to talk and catchup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Marielle was relentless and when she had something on her mind, she wouldn&#39;t be able to rest until she poured it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together they both watched Valentina who was staring at the hydrangeas with a faraway look in her eyes. Marielle pitied her a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t know yet. Why haven&#39;t you told her what she is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy scoffed, he knew what Marielle was referring to. And frankly he found it a bit silly that that was what she was worried about, given everything else that had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should see how shocked she was to hear that I was her husband at the hospital, you really think she would believe if I told her she was a werewolf?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, she will be in heat soon. And she will find out sooner than later. You should at least prepare her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell her when it&#39;s time. She doesn&#39;t remember anything yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if she never remembers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought had crossed his mind many times. What if she didn&#39;t remember? The doctor had told him whatever happed to her must have bene traumatic. Foe her to have been declared dead. But what if she never recovered her memories?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if she never recovered her memories? Remy didn&#39;t know how he would feel about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Much of who Valentina was, was unknown to him, it still was, maybe it was best she forgot that part of herself. That mysterious and elusive part that kept him and everyone in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The new Valentina, if she ever finally trusted him, would at least not have to keep him in the dark, or hide things about her past, because she would simply have no memory of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ll cross that bridge when we get there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how was your mission?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you wanted me to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ve been itching to tell me since you&#39;ve been back, so you might as well tell me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle smirked, she folded her arms and frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, You were right about Grayson. He&#39;s a conniving bastard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should have never trusted him. he&#39;s a snake and he&#39;s not on our side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me something new.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, I managed to find another way in. Another contact who tells me there&#39;s some super secret meeting a full moon from now. And I managed to snag an invite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was Marielle. Spymaster of the Silverback Pride pack. While Kale was better with leadership and Remy felt comfortable enough to delegate to him and lead the pack, Marielle was the charming spy. With her, he was in the loop about everything that he had to know with the outside world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything and anything he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except Valentina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As good of a spy that Marielle was, the one tough nut she had been unable to crack was Valentina. Months ago when he had found out she was his mate, Marielle had carried out her investigations and came up with nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing at all, not even a family member, or some ancestry he could trace. It was as if she never existed before. And something about that bothered him deeply, it bothered Marielle even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This, of course also made her upset and rubbed her the wrong way so she tried to get to know Valentina as a friend. To find out more about her, to see if she would ever spill some useful information, but Valentina wouldn&#39;t let her guard down. It wasn&#39;t long until she  discovered the game Marielle was trying to play and she started avoiding her like the plague.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina would not even give Marielle the time of the day and Marielle eventually stopped trying to be her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two ladies never got along since then.</p>
