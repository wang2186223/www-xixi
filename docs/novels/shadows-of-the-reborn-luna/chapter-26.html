                <p>&#34;Oh. I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry?! That&#39;s all you&#39;re going to say?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well what else do you want me to say. I told you what to expect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t mention anything about kissing me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was not a kiss. That was just a small peck on the lips to deescalate the situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I didn&#39;t agree to do that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. It was a spur of the moment sort of thing. But I did warn you about it. We were going to be acting like a real couple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you forget that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina sighed and rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t get warm, no matter how much she tried. She left on her bulky winter jacket, she was probably going to sleep in them since the house was just as cold as it was outside. No heater in it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Jaxon? The mantle stuff you were talking about?! What&#39;s that about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and he sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh well. It&#39;s a long story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She persisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then. I&#39;ll tell you about the mantle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was originally named the Cezar box. It is a special statue of power amongst the founding werewolf families. This mantle spends at least a three years or even up to a decade with each family before moving to the next. But the next pack must prove themselves worthy before the mantle can move to them. It allows them to have special immunities, attend and be privy to otherworldly powers and information and enjoy limitless prosperity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has the mantle ever moved to your pack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina asked and Remy flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once. But we don&#39;t like to talk about it. It was a really long time and a bad time for all involved. But long story short the alpha then lost the mantle and our pack was deemed unfit to have it. That stigma has remained ever since then and my father and his father before him we&#39;ve been trying our hardest to rid ourselves of that stigma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So they still think you&#39;re unfit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well it&#39;s one thing or the other with them. Our lack of a Luna for decades also added to it. But over the years we&#39;ve proven ourselves to be strong enough to hold the mantle. But then we&#39;ve been hearing rumors. Secret meetings too, almost as if they&#39;re all working against us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any reason why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina asked and Remy chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This mantle is a power symbol Valentina. And if there&#39;s one thing people want, it&#39;s more power. No family ever truly wants to give up the mantle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Jaxon wants to keep it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It certainly seems like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well... that sounds like a sticky situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured as she sat down on the bed. She was surprised he told her so much, but there were still things he was hiding from her, like the ritual, so far he had still not mentioned anything about it and she wondered if he ever would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them were silent for a while. Remy taking off his bulky boots and putting them away while Valentina examined the cabin for what seemed to be the tenth time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had not talked much about their sleeping arrangements but it was clear they would be sleeping together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kale and Remy couldn&#39;t share a bed, it would be very uncomfortable for them. And the sofa in the small living room would never be comfortable enough for Remy. It was made for sitting and even with that it was really small. The only available option was that they&#39;d share a room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something they had done before, but she had not objected to it then because she needed his help, this time, with everything that happened, she wouldn&#39;t object to it but she wasn&#39;t exactly open to the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked outside the window and sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks so beautiful outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you wanna go for a walk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll only be there  to make sure you&#39;re safe and you don&#39;t get lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh that&#39;s comforting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then. We can take a walk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...............</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was supposed to be a short walk, but what was a short walk became a hike. Remy had  told her that they could see the northern lights if they walked a little bit further and the thought of seeing the Aurora Borealis made her beam with joy. She was instantly reenergized and she walked faster, not minding that it was the middle of the night and it was almost nearly pitch black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy had good eyesight and navigated the frozen woods for her, so she didn&#39;t have to worry about anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long time of hiking through the wilderness, they finally made it to a clearing where they could see the northern lights dancing in the sky above them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I have no words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured and Remy smiled as he watched her. She was completely enraptured with it, to the point where she stood perfectly still and stopped complaining about the cold air biting at her now reddened cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at him and smiled and he walked closer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood there in awe and slowly, Remy took her hand in his, silently hoping that she wouldn&#39;t push him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t, she was too mesmerized by the colors and patterns swirling above her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sky was pitch black except for the neon green, purple, and pink lights that illuminated the surroundings. The auroras looked like a soft and delicate dance, waving and twisting across the sky in fluid motions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina slowly leaned into Remy&#39;s shoulder as they watched the magnificent display, feeling the warmth of his body and his breath on her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The temperature was freezing, but she didn&#39;t care, the warmth radiating from Remy was enough, more than enough to keep her warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were too busy staring up at the sky and marveling at the beauty of it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina and Remy had never felt so alive and connected. It was if they were the only two people on earth, lost in their own world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stayed there for what might have been hours, wrapped in each other&#39;s arms, watching the northern lights until they slowly started to fade away. As the last glimmers of light faded, they knew they had just witnessed something truly special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina turned to Remy, her heart beating fast with excitement. &#34;Did you see that?! That was magical. I&#39;ve never seen anything so beautiful,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rent smiled back at her, his eyes sparkling in the darkness, the fact that she was so excited and happy about seeing the northern lights made him equally happy too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And at peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen anything more beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was a small lie on his part, because he had, he had seen something more beautiful than the northern lights, and it was the smile on Valentina&#39;s face. Watching her entire face light up with joy as she looked at them, he had never seen her so happy before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t tell her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No not yet she would never understand or reciprocate his feelings. So he kept it to himself  and decided to enjoy the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because it might be all he had. And probably the first and only time he would see her smile so fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she regained her memories, she would go back to her old self. He would never see that smile again, at least not with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them stood there for a moment longer, taking in the last of the northern lights before turning to make their way back to the cabin. They knew they would remember the moment forever, and it would be a memory that would always bring them back to that magical place in Alaska.</p>
