                <p>Colin had made up his mind to leave Oaks Creek town. He believed it was for the best, he had stayed too long and now the past hung heavily on him. He had come because of Goldie&#39;s funeral and he had stayed longer than he anticipated that he would. Too long. Way too long, he thought as he packed his belongings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of his decision hung heavy in his heart as he packed his belongings into his old, battered suitcase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked down the quiet streets, lost in thought, he never expected to run into anyone, let alone Goldie&#39;s grandmother, whom Goldie  fondly called Nana. He was shocked to see her. Nana stayed in a nursing home, why was she walking around the streets?!  Nana was known for her gentle demeanor and wise words, but today, she appeared disheveled and out of sorts. She was wearing what appeared to be pajamas and a hooded jacket , her long gray hair scattered around her head. There was a pair of slippers on her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nana?! Nana what are you doing here?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked in shock as he looked around, the nursing home was only a few blocks away, he could take her back safely without any hassle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lockwood?! Is that the Lockwood boy?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. It&#39;s me. Colin Lockwood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Colin, dear,&#34; Nana croaked, clutching his arm as if her frail grip was the only thing keeping her upright. &#34;I remember you. I saw you not long ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin nodded as he swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. At Goldie&#39;s funeral.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nana looked up at him with narrowed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goldie&#39;s not dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said strongly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin decided it was best to play along, not wanting to upset the old woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. You&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for a while and searched his face to see if he really believed his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you know! You know the truth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin nodded, fighting the tears from dropping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But do you know where Goldie could be?&#34; She asked and Colin shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I don&#39;t. Do you?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nana shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s always had a wandering soul. She couldn&#39;t really control it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin furrowed his brows, taken aback by Nana&#39;s words. Goldie was dead. Nana&#39;s words sounded like the ramblings of an elderly woman suffering from dementia. He shouldn&#39;t encourage this, no not anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well... Nana she&#39;s been gone for a long time now... I doubt she&#39;ll ever be back,&#34; Colin replied gently, trying to ease Nana&#39;s agitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nana&#39;s eyes widened, and she gripped his arm even tighter. &#34;No, no, dear, you don&#39;t understand. Goldie&#39;s still out there, wandering, lost in the world. Her soul is looking for her body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has always been special, it wasn&#39;t her time, she wasn&#39;t going to die that way. Goldie is fine! We just have to gently guide her back home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could use your help too, you cannot leave yet. The two of you have always been very close... she must miss you in some way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin didn&#39;t know what to make of Nana&#39;s bizarre claims, but he didn&#39;t want to upset Nana further. She was clearly in distress. He nodded solemnly, pretending to believe her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Nana, I won&#39;t leave. I promise I&#39;ll help you find Goldie,&#34; he said, hoping to ease her anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nana&#39;s frail face broke into a relieved smile, and she patted his hand. &#34;Thank you, Colin, bless your heart. We must find her before it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Nana&#39;s shaky guidance, Colin escorted her back to the nursing home. As they walked, Nana spoke of Goldie&#39;s favorite places and the memories they had shared. Colin couldn&#39;t help but wonder if there was a glimmer of truth in Nana&#39;s words. Maybe, just maybe, Goldie was still out there, lost and searching for them just as they were missing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.........</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily Parson had been in Goldie&#39;s room when she heard the phone call. It was from Colin, apparently Nana had left the nursing home. She had walked out and was talking gibberish again. She was exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily&#39;s heart raced as she rushed through the sliding glass doors of the nursing home, her footsteps echoing in the sterile hallway. Nana had taken the news of Goldie&#39;s death really badly, in fact, she blatantly refused to believe it. She claimed Goldie was still alive and not dead. She had endured her mother&#39;s ramblings the first time it had happened, they were all dealing with the grief in their own way, and it was hard on all of them but Nana seemed to still be in denial about Goldie&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin was waiting near the entrance, his face etched with concern and exhaustion. Lily approached him, her eyes filled with a mix of gratitude and regret. &#34;Colin, I&#39;m sorry for the trouble,&#34; she began, her voice trembling. &#34;Thank you for bringing her back here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin nodded, his gaze heavy with the weight of the situation. &#34;It&#39;s the least I could do, Mrs Parson. Nana also asked for you, and I thought it would be better for her to see a familiar face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they walked down the corridor, reaching Nana&#39;s room. The frail woman lay in her bed, her eyes bright with recognition as she saw her daughter Lily. &#34;Lily, dear, you&#39;ve come!&#34; Nana exclaimed, her voice quivering with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily forced a smile, leaning over to hug the old woman gently. &#34;Of course, Nana. I&#39;m here for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they settled into the room, Nana&#39;s conversation took a surprising turn. &#34;You know, Lily,&#34; she said with a knowing glint in her eye, &#34;I told Colin about Goldie. He believes me. He&#39;s going to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goldie is still out there. We have to find a way to save her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily&#39;s heart sank, and she felt a knot tighten in her chest. She had been trying to bury the pain of losing her daughter deep within herself, and Nana&#39;s words threatened to unearth it all. It was really hard dealing with someone like her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nana, please,&#34; she whispered, tears welling up in her eyes. &#34;Goldie... she&#39;s gone. You mustn&#39;t say such things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nana&#39;s eyes, though clouded with age, were filled with an unshakable conviction. &#34;No, Lily, I know better than you when it comes to these things. That&#39;s why I vehemently opposed the burial. Time is running out, we need to find Goldie&#39;s soul wherever she wandered to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily couldn&#39;t bear it any longer. Her emotions boiled over, and she screamed at Nana, &#34;Stop it, mother! Goldie is dead! You&#39;re just tormenting me with all of your silly delusions!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin, caught in the middle of this heart-wrenching confrontation, rose from his chair, his eyes filled with sadness. He couldn&#39;t bear to see Mrs Parson and Nana in such pain, it was horrible, watching how they were all differently affected by her death. &#34;I think I should go,&#34; he muttered, his voice barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily, her anger subsiding into a flood of tears, turned to him, her voice filled with remorse. &#34;Colin, I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head, offering a weak smile. &#34;It&#39;s okay, Mrs Parson. We&#39;re all hurting in our own ways.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Colin left the room, leaving behind a mother and grandmother, both wounded by their grief. Lily held Nana&#39;s trembling hand, unable to shake the haunting feeling that perhaps, in Nana&#39;s world, Goldie lived on.</p>
