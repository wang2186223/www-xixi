                <p>The full moon was only a few hours to go, but anxiety and worry was already eating at Valentina. She couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the text message she got and then the nightmare that seemed to repeat itself the next night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She busied herself as much as she could, finding out she had a natural talent for baking, she found herself in the kitchen with the chef. She helped him cook some of the meals, since they were having so much guests and she found out that it especially gave her a lot of satisfaction. Especially when she baked. She baked the lemon pies, lots of bagels and bread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Ellen was surprised, commenting that Valentina baked as if she had done it all her life, meanwhile she rarely ever entered the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s like you&#39;re a whole new person!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Chef had commented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She has laughed nervously and asked what he meant and he hesitated. She finally urged him to speak and he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You weren&#39;t always in the brightest of moods. And there was barely anything that could make you smile, but it&#39;s different now. You&#39;re different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the words had stuck to her. Truly and deeply they had stuck to her because she also couldn&#39;t fathom or imagine why everything about her was so different. It was as if she was a whole new person, as if her past life was lived by somebody else. Even her dreams were just as confusing as her reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those were the things that she couldn&#39;t fathom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valentina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice called out from behind and she froze a bit, realising who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and saw Remy in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had not seen him for a long time. Hours even. Not since the arrived, not even during dinner. Apparently he was very occupied with a lot of things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remy...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured as she dusted her skirt. She was in the kitchen, just putting away some leftovers for the chef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked as she turned to look at hm, his frame was so large that he occupied the entire door frame. He was wearing a deep blue shirt and dark pants. His hair was in a bun on the top of his head, with long strands of it framing his face. He looked a little tired. The dark circles around his eyes were hard to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked towards her and she almost stepped back out of shyness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was always something abut his presence, a way that he walked that made it seem as if time slowed down when he walked. The aura he possessed was only something someone of his calibre and kind would have. An alpha. She secretly wondered what his wolf would look like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle&#39;s had been terrifying enough, so she had no doubt his would look way more scary and bigger, given his huge build.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mother said you&#39;ve been helping out a lot. Thank you for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh it&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured as she ran her hand through her hair while fidgeting slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only wanted to help out. It seemed like everyone was doing something and I didn&#39;t just want to sit down and watch them do all the work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to. You&#39;re a Luna. But I&#39;m grateful for your help. And I&#39;m sure everyone else is too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached into his back pocket and brought out what looked like a credit card. He handed it to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As you know, the full moon is approaching. We&#39;ll be out in the wild for a few days and all. I don&#39;t want you here all alone. So I suggest you take time off and go somewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked in disbelief, barely believing the words that were coming out of Remy&#39;s mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re giving me your card.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For whatever it is you want to buy or you think you might need. You could lodge in an hotel for a few days, if you want I can help you set up a place. But you&#39;re free to do whatever you want in the meantime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alone?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked startled and Remy chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For security reasons I will have two of my trusted men with you. They&#39;ll be with you at all times, watching from a distance to make sure you&#39;re safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just didn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What game was he playing at. She wasn&#39;t even allowed to leave the premises without someone stopping her or anything and now he was letting her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you doing this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and he sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you scared that I&#39;ll run away or something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a pointed look, but then he smiled and answered, &#34; Oh I wish you wouldn&#39;t, but I&#39;m being serious. You probably need a change of environment and I wouldn&#39;t feel good about keeping you holed up here when you could be up there having a good time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured and Remy smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to say anything. You just have to say yes and agree to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the card again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Definitely!!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squealed and he nodded. He started walking away, but then he halted and turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be afraid to spend as much as you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...............</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a stupid decision. It really was. But she only realised it after. That she was back in the town where it had all happened. Back in the town where she had been supposedly found dead. Only this time she was alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And no, she wasn&#39;t going to see any specialist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy would never imagine that she would come here. Or maybe he would, either way she wasn&#39;t sure she cared what he thought about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a party in town. Something about founder&#39;s day. She didn&#39;t fully know what it was, but the streets was alive with people. There were ribbons and people giving out pamphlets. She didn&#39;t stop to check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lodging into her hotel, she had decided to take a walk and check out the local shops. As promised, the two bodyguards Remy had given her were following her closely. She wasn&#39;t even annoyed by their presence. She just felt strangely comforted that they were following her and keeping her safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first shop was one which sold makeup, she found it weird that she didn&#39;t have any, so she picked out a couple of stuff she wanted. After the makeup shop she went into a small boutique, they didn&#39;t have anything trendy but they did have some stuff she really liked. The lack of jeans and fitted dresses in her closet made her wonder if it was all really her clothes. They just didn&#39;t seem like the things she would wear, but she had definitely tried her best to manage the pieces and wear what she wanted to wear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cafe shop she had been to the last time she came to the town was her last stop before she went back to her hotel. Luckily, they had more to order this time around, so she sat down and ordered the something different again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice called out and she turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Colin!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That guy who she gave up her spot at the doctor for. He was looking much better now. Clean clothes, nice smile and a boyish handsomeness she had almost not noticed before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Valentina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said as he shook her hand gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never thought I&#39;d see you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Why&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured and he shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you just don&#39;t look like you&#39;re from around town. I&#39;m sorry are you from around town?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked and she shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. You&#39;re right. I&#39;m not. What about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m leaving tomorrow. I&#39;m just here to have a drink with someone. What about you? Are you here with someone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked as he looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No she wasn&#39;t. The two bodyguards with her had sat down at least two tables away from her, pretending to be interested in the stale old newspaper on their table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I&#39;m not. I was hungry. I decided to come and eat..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin looked at the bags and chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like you had a busy day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said and Valentina blushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just looking around town. Shopping can be strangely therapeutic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially when it wasn&#39;t your own money. She thought. She still had more stuff to buy, since it wasn&#39;t her card she planned on spending as much as she could. She would also do some online shopping before she left town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can imagine. I had a friend that liked taking a look around the shops. Makeup, clothes, shoes and all, you name it. It always found a way to lift her mood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I think we&#39;d make good friends then, I can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve been this happy and relieved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colin&#39;s smile slowly fell from his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yea... you would have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Colin?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice called interrupting them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know that voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina thought as her head started to throb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! Mrs Parson. I&#39;m here. Welcome...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the voice faded, Valentina closed her eyes and was confronted with a memory. A woman&#39;s face barely inches from hers, stroking her hair softly and singing her a song. A lightly dimmed room, painted soft pink, she was on the bed, the blanket wrapped snugly around her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You are my sunshine, my only sunshine..*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You make me happy when skies are grey*.....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman smiled at her, with familiar green eyes and curly strawberry blond hair in a messy bun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said out loud.</p>
