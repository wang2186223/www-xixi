                <p>The sun was beginning its descent beyond the horizon as Remy returned from his business meeting. Goldie had been waiting on the beach, the gentle breeze tousling her short black hair as she gazed out at the waves rolling in. As Remy approached, she turned, her face lighting up with a smile that could rival the sun itself. She was wearing nothing but shorts and a long white shirt and a bikini underneath. Remy had taken off his suit jacket, his white shirt was rolled up all the way to his elbows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you,&#34; she greeted as she waved at him. Though they were now friendly with each other, she wasn&#39;t sure a hug would have been appropriate. She didn&#39;t want things between them to be awkward. A lot had been going on between them lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot of things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Valentina,&#34; Remy replied. He dropped his suitcase on the sand. &#34;Sorry I&#39;m late. The meeting ran longer than I expected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie shook her head. &#34;No worries. I&#39;ve been enjoying the view.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to close a deal on some property that I owned. I thought I&#39;d finish things a lot sooner, but apparently I didn&#39;t....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked hand in hand along the shoreline, the wet sand cool beneath their feet. Seagulls soared overhead, and the rhythmic sound of the waves provided a soothing backdrop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow. I thought you were kidding when you said you were into real estate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled and Remy gave her a pointed look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the family business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they strolled, Goldie asked, &#34;And if you weren&#39;t in the family business or an alpha what do you think you&#39;d be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy chuckled, his amber eyes reflecting the playful glint in Goldie&#39;s own. &#34;Hmm, that&#39;s a tough one. I&#39;ve never really thought about it. Maybe a mechanic?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie burst into laughter, playfully swatting his arm. &#34;A mechanic? Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy grinned. &#34;Well, yeah. I&#39;ve always loved fixing cars. There&#39;s something satisfying about making something broken run smoothly again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie shook her head, still laughing. &#34;You, the big, strong alpha, under a car, covered in grease? I&#39;d love to see that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy feigned offense, &#34;Hey now, there&#39;s more to me than just being an alpha, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their playful banter was interrupted by the sound of the crashing waves. Goldie grabbed Remy&#39;s hand and dragged him closer to the water&#39;s edge. &#34;Prove it!&#34; she challenged before, with a mischievous glint in her eye, she playfully shoved him into the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy splashed into the shallows, his clothes instantly drenched. He sputtered and laughed as he stood up, water dripping from his hair and clothes, even in that moment, he looked very handsome, Goldie thought as she tried not to look too hard at the outlines of his body underneath his wet clothes. &#34;Okay, you got me,&#34; he admitted, shaking his head to send a spray of water droplets in Goldie&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She giggled, her heart pounding as they locked eyes. In that moment, with the fading sun casting an orange and pink glow over the ocean, it felt like time had slowed. The world around them faded away, and it seemed as though they might finally share that another kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, as if on cue, a massive wave crashed onto the shore, drenching them both and shattering the tender moment. They broke into laughter again, the salty taste of the sea on their lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stood there, drenched and grinning, Remy leaned in close to Goldie, with his height and build, he towered over her, almost blocking the sunset view from her line of sight, his voice was barely above a whisper. &#34;Maybe being an alpha isn&#39;t the only thing I&#39;m good at.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie&#39;s heart fluttered as their lips drew nearer, but before they could kiss, another wave surged forward, playfully teasing them once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>......</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie and Remy had spent the entire day basking in the warm sun and playing along the shoreline, their laughter carried away by the ocean breeze. As the evening sun dipped below the horizon, casting a fiery glow across the beach, they decided it was time to retire to their cozy beach house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the salty scent of the sea lingered in the air, Goldie settled in the comfortable bed while Remy stayed outside  to receive a call. The night seemed peaceful and she was very tired, she couldn&#39;t wait to go to bed, but as Goldie&#39;s dreams took hold, tranquility was shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the depths of her slumber, Goldie found herself in a nightmarish dream. Valentina  appeared before her, her eyes filled with an ominous glow. Her clothes were black and tattered and the skin beneath it looked moon white. She whispered chillingly, &#34;Your time is running out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terror gripped Goldie, and she screamed, &#34;Leave me alone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave you alone?! You&#39;re in my body!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The apparition of Valentina screamed as she ran after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goldie&#39;s body grew hot, and she thrashed in bed, trapped in the grip of her nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy was jolted awake by Valentina&#39;s cries, concern etching on his face. He called out to her, &#34;Valentina! Valentina! Wake up!&#34; But she was trapped within her nightmare, unable to hear him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation mounting, Remy knew he had to act quickly, her body was burning hot, he shook her but she wouldn&#39;t wake up. He leaped out of bed and, with great urgency and effortless ease, carried her into his arms and rushed outside toward the moonlit shore. The cool, soothing embrace of the ocean awaited them. He hoped the saltwater would break the nightmare&#39;s hold on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they reached the water&#39;s edge, Goldie&#39;s screams persisted, her body trembling with fear. Remy, undeterred, gently out her into the water, he submerged her briefly once, hoping the need for air would break her out of her nightmare.  He did it again, whispering her name with each attempt, &#34;Valentina... Valentina, it&#39;s me, Remy. Wake up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, the icy water began to penetrate Goldie&#39;s consciousness. Her screams softened, replaced by ragged breaths. She blinked, disoriented, and finally met Remy&#39;s worried gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remy?&#34; she stammered, her voice quivering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Valentina, it&#39;s me. You&#39;re safe now,&#34; he assured her, wrapping his arms around her trembling form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they stood by the water&#39;s edge, the gentle waves lapping at their feet, until Goldie&#39;s breathing returned to normal, until her temperature dropped and her heart stopped racing. The danger had passed, and the nightmare was left behind in the dark waters of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the first light of dawn painted the horizon, Goldie and Remy returned to their beach house to pack their things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time to go back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.......</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabel Fleming had snuck out of her nursing home again. The nursing home would be confused, since they had placed her under strict care, but Isabel had her ways. She had to do something, every day that passed was a day that Goldie was not back in a body. She needed to save her granddaughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside of the nursing home, Greg Colby, her sister&#39;s husband, a believer of the faith was already waiting for her across the street in his car and her younger sister Camilla. Her younger sister just arrived in town after she had told her the news and the urgency of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had woken up a few nights ago from a vivid dream about Goldie, her granddaughter. And it gave her all the confirmation that she needed that Goldie&#39;s soul was somewhere and she was truly not dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nana whispered as she got into Greg&#39;s car. &#34;Thank you, Greg, for helping us with this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Greg smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We heard the situation and knew we had to step in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camilla nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t imagine how you&#39;re feeling Isabel. I can&#39;t bear the thought of Goldie&#39;s soul just wandering aimlessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camilla held her sister&#39;s hand. They were ten years apart, but age had been kinder on Camilla. And while her seventy-six year old sister Isabel looked her age, sixty-six year old Camilla and her husband looked like they were just approaching fifty. Being childless seemed to have been a huge advantage in that part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We understand, Isabel. We&#39;ll do our best to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been having the same dream ever since that night. And it feels like in a way Goldie is trying to tell me something...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nana looked at Camilla with desperation</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;ve seen her, Camilla, I&#39;ve felt her presence. She&#39;s not at peace. We must find her a temporary host body and bring her back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camilla nodded. &#34;We can&#39;t just ask anybody. This is a delicate matter, but I believe if we go back and tell the society, they might be able to find us a host body if we plead our case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nana&#39;s eyes filled with gratitude as they pressed on into the night. The car driving round the small town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the bells. We must get the bells for the ritual to bring her back. Greg, can you promise you&#39;ll find the bells needed for the ceremony?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will drop a formal request, but you know how the society is with these things. I can&#39;t promise, but I&#39;ll try my best. It won&#39;t be easy for them to release those ancient bells.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camilla turned to her sister, their hands still intertwined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your daughter?! How is she taking it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabel sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lily isn&#39;t a believer of the faith. I tried to talk to her. But she wouldn&#39;t listen to me. It&#39;s up to me now to find a way to save my granddaughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not just you. You have us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Camilla said reassuringly. There was a smile on her gentle face. Greg nodded too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Isabel felt at ease. More at ease than she had ever felt in a while.</p>
