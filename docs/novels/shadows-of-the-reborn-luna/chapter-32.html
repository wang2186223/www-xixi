                <p>Valentina was still on the path of recovery, ventured outside the mansion for a peaceful walk around the property. As much as she liked resting and laying in bed, she decided that walking around work do her some good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she strolled, her eyes fell upon Marielle, engaged in a sparring session with another member of the pack, she didn&#39;t remember the name of the person but he was tall. And he was twice the height of Marielle and bigger than her. But Marielle was nimble and swift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina marveled at Marielle&#39;s prowess, her movements were fluid and harmonious. She moved as if she was dancing and even while fighting, she looked graceful while doing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina felt slightly jealous that she couldn&#39;t do that. That would have come in handy while those men had captured her, she thought with a frown on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fight concluded with Marielle&#39;s victory, and Valentina&#39;s applause caught her attention. Marielle glanced at her and that was all. She didn&#39;t spare her another look, but Valentina wasn&#39;t going to give up so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impressed by Marielle&#39;s skill, Valentina approached her, their eyes meeting. &#34;That was amazing,&#34; Valentina remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle&#39;s gaze held a hint of concern. &#34;Are you fully healed now?&#34; she inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina shook her head. She was still sore, patchy and purple in some places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not entirely. But I couldn&#39;t stay indoors any longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A distant look crossed Marielle&#39;s face. Valentina shamelessly continued, deciding to ignore it. &#34;You fight so well. Maybe you can teach me some moves. I think it will come in handy next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle&#39;s response was blunt. &#34;Why would I be teaching you anything?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina sighed, finally deciding to address the elephant in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something wrong? I&#39;m getting the feeling that you don&#39;t want me here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle raised her eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wrong. I just don&#39;t like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taken aback, Valentina hesitated before murmuring, &#34;If it&#39;s because  of what just happened... I apologise. I was just looking for answers for my lost memories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle&#39;s eyes remained unyielding. &#34;That&#39;s no excuse. You can be very reckless and selfish, always putting yourself in harm&#39;s way without caring about how others feel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina sighed softly. &#34;I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m sorry if I offended you in any way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle&#39;s voice remained firm. &#34;Oh you know very well I&#39;m not the one you should be apologising to...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I will. We haven&#39;t gotten around to talking, but we will...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trailed off as she thought about talking and apologising to Remy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina looked at Marielle. Marielle was a strong werewolf, she knew how to defend herself and she would have managed to save herself in that kind of situation. She wanted to learn how to fight too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to learn to defend myself,&#34; Valentina finally confessed. &#34;I want you to teach me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle&#39;s hesitation was evident. &#34;I might not be the best teacher... Because believe me I don&#39;t have the kind of patience that it would require to be a tutor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Valentina&#39;s determination showed in her eyes. &#34;I&#39;m willing to learn. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marielle considered her request, then sighed. &#34;Fine. Come back when you&#39;re feeling better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we&#39;ll be able to talk about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..........</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellen treated Valentina to pizza. Two large pepperoni pizzas. Valentina was stuffed after she finished with it. Ellen was a nice woman, she felt bad for hurting her especially the way she did, but she  wouldn&#39;t be able to understand, she was not the real Valentina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she knew who she truly was, she had to find a way to leave again, for good this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought about seeing her parents and talking to them. She also thought about seeing Colin and her grandmother. She could imagine how they would all feel. Would they even believe her?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was in another body. He real body was buried six feet&#39;s under and most likely rotting. Oh God</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no absolute way she could come back to life was there?! She would be stuck as Valentina forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought she sighed. It was hopeless!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely hopeless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door to the room opened and it pulled her out of her thoughts. Remy walked in, he didn&#39;t even spare her a glance as he walked towards the closet. They had not really had a chance to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was also a bag in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed him, calling after him softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remy? Can we talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe later. I have to pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered. She looked around and saw that he was throwing clothes inside a bag. Pack? Was he going on a trip?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and he shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I figured I&#39;d sleep in another room for the next few nights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remy, wait. Please, let&#39;s talk about things..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally turned to look at her. &#34;Valentina, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s much left to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If this is about you leaving then you don&#39;t have to explain yourself. In fact, when you&#39;ve recovered you&#39;re free to leave. You can go right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was stunned as she heard him speak. He was letting her go?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Willingly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must be really mad at her then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only left because I wanted to find out the truth about who I was. That town was the only town that could give me answers. That&#39;s why I left...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answers?! And you couldn&#39;t talk to me about it like a normal sensible adult?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I&#39;m the foolish one Valentina, after that night in Alaska, watching the northern lights with you, I thought something had changed between us....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was softer now, she could see that he had truly been really hurt by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remy, I can&#39;t deny that it was a special moment. But there&#39;s so much I don&#39;t understand about myself. I couldn&#39;t just ignore all of that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And look where that got you?! You only ended up putting yourself in danger didn&#39;t you?! And once I again I had to come in and save you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When will you learn Valentina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your past is as complicated enough as it already is! Don&#39;t go searching for answers alone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it&#39;s not my past! She wanted to scream. It was Valentina&#39;s past. She was Goldie! Goldie Parson and she had been roped into this weird mysterious woman&#39;s life and now she didn&#39;t know if she would ever get out of it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to leave the rest of her life as Valentina, who knows how many enemies the woman had running after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to leave, tell me about it. You&#39;re not a prisoner here, I will not keep you here against your will. You&#39;ve made it quite clear that you do not care about me or the mating bond between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remy. No. It&#39;s not... it&#39;s not like that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured as she rubbed at her eyes. How could she explain to him? How could she tell him?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t even Valentina, but if she tried to explain that she was someone else he would never believe her, he would just think she was lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I ask a question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked and he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve mentioned that you didn&#39;t marry me for love. And when I was talking to that healer that you brought, he told you about your pack&#39;s history with Lunas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remy I want you to be honest with me, do you care about the mating bond between us or there is another reason why you&#39;re keeping me around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy was silent, for what seemed to be longest period of time. Then he finally sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know John told you about the story...  but then again, it&#39;s John, I should have expected that from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you&#39;re right. There is another reason I&#39;m keeping you around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it then? Wouldn&#39;t you tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked and Remy nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would... come, let&#39;s sit down for a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Lunathion is a ritual between the Luna and the alpha in a pack. It is an ancient ritual that is meant to channel power back into the pack. We&#39;ve been missing out on that ritual for years now and a lot of other packs perceive that we are weak because of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ohhh... and it&#39;s important?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remy nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is. We haven&#39;t had one in a really long time, so you can imagine how it is... when I met you and found out that you were my mate, I couldn&#39;t help but think that it would finally be possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That we will finally be able to have the lunathion ritual.&#34;</p>
