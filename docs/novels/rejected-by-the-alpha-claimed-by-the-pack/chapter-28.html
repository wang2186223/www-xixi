                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently, a very ridiculous rumor had been spreading. They said that the new witch, negotiator, seduced our future Alpha. This was really very harmonious with my original guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Claudia could seduce anyone with her current beauty, I knew very well that she was not such a person. I also wanted to go and asked Claudia. But she had avoided me. I could understand her very well. After all, I had done so much bad to her two years ago. So I found Neil and wanted to ask what happened to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I found Neil, he sat on the leather chair in the living room and drank his father&#39;s whiskey. He looked very disappointed. I didn&#39;t know if I should disturb him at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was about to leave, he said, &#34;Don&#39;t just stand there and look at me. What are you going to do?&#34; He seemed to be drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not in a good state right now. Let&#39;s talk about it when you sober.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Neil did not intend to let me go. &#34;I am in a very good state. Just say what you want to say!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no way to deal with the drunkard, Neil. I could only tell him, &#34;Recently, there is a rumor that Claudia seduces you. We all know what kind of person Claudia is. She will not do such a thing. What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil was excited when he heard Claudia&#39;s name. &#34;She didn&#39;t seduce me, but I like her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?!&#34; I never knew that he liked Claudia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said! I like Claudia! I confessed to her!&#34; He shouted at my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The great sense of danger made me panic. I pulled Neil&#39;s clothes and let him look at me. &#34;What did she say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil was full of alcohol and his tone became fierce. &#34;She refused me. She refused me!!&#34; Then he looked at me. &#34;Why are you so concerned? Do you like Claudia too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His answer brought me back to my senses. &#34;This has nothing to do with you.&#34; I let go of his clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think she can take a fancy to you? I am the next Alpha. You are nothing!&#34; Neil pointed at me and shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You drank too much. I will help you back to rest.&#34; I did not take his nonsense to heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Neil pushed away my hand that was holding him. &#34;I am very sober. I have never been more awake than I am now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was distorted with resentment. &#34;Do you think you are very powerful? Does everyone want to circle around you? Let me tell you! Claudia is my woman. We will become Alpha and Luna, and you are just nobody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this what he thought of me, his elder brother? I sighed. Neil became more and more like Andre. Since he became the future Alpha, he began to become violent and cunning. It was difficult for me to see the original Neil from him. My gentle younger brother disappeared, but I was not qualified to judge him. I was no longer the elder brother who stood up for him everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, I still wanted to drag him out of the mire as much as possible. &#34; What else do you have besides the identity of the heir? You hold it like you are holding onto a life-saving straw. I never felt that everyone is around me. But you, no one around you to make you feel unhappy and weak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he did not understand what I meant. He began to shift because of anger, and his fur was attached to his face. &#34;Don&#39;t think about what you can&#39;t get. I am the future Alpha, and Claudia is my woman!&#34; He cursed me bitterly. &#34;I want you to die outside. Father and I pray to Moon Goddess that you will never come back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your woman?&#34; The aura that had been suppressed in my body was finally stimulated by him. It was the power that I had honed from countless battlefields in the past two years. Caesar roared in my mind, and he was also enraged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Neil came into contact with my aura, he immediately returned to his human form. Not long after, he spat out all the wine he had drunk. I could feel that his wolf was unwilling to come out because he was afraid. Fear was the instinct to survive, which proved that he knew the difference in our strength. And those who tried to kill me had already rotted in the soil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked down at Neil, who was lying on the ground in fear. &#34;I should thank you for driving me out. Look at you now. No wonder you were suppressed and beaten by other packs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This noble son had never left the ivory tower. He knew nothing about my life outside. I once took a small team to go near the Midnight pack to inquire about the news, but there was a traitor in my team. He told the Midnight pack about our news. The Midnight pack was famous for stealing and fierce killing. We were completely surrounded by The Midnight pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My men were all dead. They tore up them. And I was almost bitten off by the Midnight pack&#39;s Alpha. They were right. I really almost died outside. I was only left with one breath. I covered my neck and knelt in the middle of the corpse of my teammates. The mixture of blood and soil was shallow beyond my knees. My vision was also covered by the blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should not die here. I must not die here! Hatred and despair stimulated my strength. My wolf blood was developed to the extreme. My wound healed rapidly. I broke the neck of the enemy in front of me with one hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t remember what happened after that. I was already in a berserk state. My physiological instincts allowed me to kill all living things that could move in front of me. It was only when the sun rose that I returned to my senses. That day I saw hell on earth. There were blood and broken corpses everywhere. I was still holding the head of the Midnight pack&#39;s Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From then on, I could feel the changes in my aura. There was always a smell of death and blood surrounding me. Since then, I rarely shifted. My wolf senses rose to a new level with excellent reaction, hearing, and sense of smell. I could defeat most enemies with my human form. Many werewolves died under my blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore, in my eyes, Neil&#39;s transformation was like a baby with a gun trying to attract the attention of adults. Before I left, I warned him, &#34;Stay away from Claudia. I could kill you without doing anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil didn&#39;t say anything. He just looked at me with resentment. In my heart, besides anger, there were some other emotions. Because he was my younger brother, I didn&#39;t know why our relationship became like this. So I still left him in the same place, but he would never try to steal my mate. Otherwise, it would be a very simple thing to kill him.</p>
