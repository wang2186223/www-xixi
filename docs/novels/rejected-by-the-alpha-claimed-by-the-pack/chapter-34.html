                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how much my mother had hidden from me. But this time, she couldn&#39;t use silence to deal with me. It was hard to say if this was due to fate. I was almost about to start a war with the White Claw pack. Toby reminded me. This made me immediately cancel the idea of attacking the White Claw pack. I couldn&#39;t do anything that would make me regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bypassed Andre&#39;s guards. He must have locked my mother in the basement. This pervert liked to torture people. When my mother was held hostage by Andre, her face was full of fatigue I had never seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were two guards standing in front of the basement door. I stunned them and opened the basement door with the key.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my mother saw my face, she grabbed my hand in a panic. &#34;Did you kill them? Did you kill the White Claw pack&#39;s people?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I calmed her down. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t kill anyone.&#34; I helped her sit on the bed. &#34;Now you should tell me the truth. Why do you care so much about the White Claw pack&#39;s people? Who is my biological father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother looked at me. It was difficult for her to tell me what happened in the past. I told her about the conversation between me and Toby, about the spiritual link and bloodline. She hesitated for a long time before slowly speaking. &#34;Twenty years ago, White Claw pack was almost exterminated by Crimson Shadow pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew this. Otherwise, Andre wouldn&#39;t have ignored my warning. He really thought that the White Claw pack&#39;s people were dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your biological father is White Claw pack&#39;s Alpha, died on the battlefield in order to protect the rest of us.&#34; When she talked about my father, her eyes were gentle that I had never seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Toby told me that Alpha didn&#39;t have a child at that time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother nodded. &#34;Because I was pregnant at that time. I went around the battlefield to escape to my mother&#39;s pack, but I was caught by Crimson Shadow pack&#39;s people on the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me guess, the person who caught you was Andre.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34; Mother said, &#34;He took a fancy to my beauty at first glance. He told me that he wanted me to be his mate. At that time, Andre was not Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Andre, a bitter expression appeared on her face. She paused for a while and continued, &#34;I should have died with my Alpha, but I was still pregnant with you, my child, and the child of the person I loved most.&#34; Mother caressed my face. &#34;I told Andre that as long as he could keep you and raise you like his son, I would agree to marry him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother&#39;s face was full of tears. I had never seen her cry since I was a child. In my memory, my mother always had a cold expression, including quarreling with Andre. She behaved like a strong she-wolf. But this she-wolf was extremely fragile now. She said to me, &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I know I haven&#39;t been able to give you much love since you were young. Because I can always remember your father when I look at you. All these years, I have always regarded you as a shackle that bound me, but you are clearly the last gift your father left me.&#34; My mother buried her face in her knees and cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hugged her gently. I didn&#39;t know that my mother had done so much for me. She had never been as gentle and kind to me as other mothers, but I could feel true love from her. &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter, mother. I will always be your child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, by the way, there&#39;s one more thing I didn&#39;t tell you.&#34; She wiped her tears and was about to speak when Andre barged in with his guards. It seemed that the guard who was stunned by me at the door woke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at who this is? I thought you went to kill White Claw pack&#39;s Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre approached me and my mother. I protected my mother behind me. &#34;I won&#39;t kill him, and you can&#39;t even touch a hair on my mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to disobey my orders?&#34; Andre waved, and his guards gathered around me and my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really had enough of this person in front of me. If he hadn&#39;t attacked my mother, I would still have had a little respect for him. But now it was clear that he was going to get rid of me and my mother. &#34;Do you think only these people can catch me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre pulled out a water silver gun from his sleeve and aimed it at my head. &#34;They can&#39;t catch you, but it can.&#34; The water silver gun could perfectly contain the werewolf&#39;s self-healing ability. He was really prepared well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he still underestimated me. It was not the first time that I was pointed at my head with a water silver gun. The moment he pulled the trigger, I turned into a wolf. I rushed to him at a speed that he did not realize. I kicked the gun in his hand and then crushed it with my claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre covered his hand that was injured by my kick. &#34;Are you going to resist your Alpha? You traitor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was you who broke the rules first! It was you who wanted to kill your Luna, and it was you who wanted to break the peace talks.&#34; I wouldn&#39;t listen to his nonsense. He couldn&#39;t hurt my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I helped my mother out. Andre shouted to the guards, &#34;Stop him! Don&#39;t let him go out!&#34; But no one dared to move. They didn&#39;t see my movements clearly. They saw the huge difference in strength, and they didn&#39;t dare to approach me at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sent my mother back to my room. My people will protect her. When I left the room, my mother said to me, &#34;You don&#39;t have to doubt yourself. You are Alpha&#39;s child. And your father is the strongest Alpha I have ever seen.&#34; I knew my mother&#39;s expectations of me. She wanted me to replace Andre as the next Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was easy for me to kill Andre. However, for the Crimson Shadow pack, I was not the legitimate heir. Neil was the one. As for my biological father&#39;s pack, the White Claw pack, now they were our enemies. Although I knew about my past, all of this was too chaotic, and my emotions began to stir restlessly. I missed Claudia too much. I missed the fragrance of the flowers and fruits on her soft body. Only by hugging her and smelling the scent on her body could I calm my emotions.</p>
