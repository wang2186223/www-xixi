                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pack&#39;s doctor told us that there was nothing unusual about Isaac. His body was just stronger than an ordinary werewolf. Isaac had been avoiding me for the past few days because Caesar suddenly went crazy that night. He was afraid that something like this would happen again, so he planned to wait until the full moon. I could understand his mood, so I could only check his symptoms in the witch&#39;s book and see if I could help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this made Toby very happy. He had been helping me for the past two days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just like the past days.&#34; Toby handed the book to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You speak as if a long time has passed. You have always been my assistant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have the nerve to say it, especially after you were marked. How many times have we met?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I searched in my memory, but I didn&#39;t expect that Isaac and I were together almost at every moment. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. Many things happened after that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby pursed his lips. &#34;There is no sincerity in your apologies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what can I do to make you forgive me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go out with me, old place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still remember the bar and the painful experience of Isaac carrying him back that day. &#34;Old place? Do you still remember how you came back last time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was an accident. We will drink less.&#34; Toby took the book from me. &#34;This is what you owe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I won&#39;t carry you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby still asked us to get into the club with his privilege. To avoid annoying people, we sat down in a corner of the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The girl has been looking at you. She is very hot.&#34; I pointed to a girl in a miniskirt. She had been looking at Toby since we entered the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby glanced at the girl. &#34;Well. She is not a patch on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t always treat me as the standard. I can guarantee that she&#39;ll be coming over soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, when the girl saw Toby look at her, she walked towards us. She said to Toby, &#34;Hey, can I sit next to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl didn&#39;t look at me at all. I was sure that she smelled Isaac on me. This was the advantage of having a powerful mate. With his mark, no one dared to approach you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, no spare seat,&#34; Toby said to the girl without raising his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever.&#34; The girl twisted her hips and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s pretty cute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So now you want me to be with someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just telling the truth. It&#39;s your freedom to be with anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby looked like he wanted to say something, but he just drank all the wine in his glass in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, your wine.&#34; The waiter brought my wine, and before I could get it, it was snatched away by Toby. He drank my wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be like this. What do you want to say?&#34; I didn&#39;t want to see him like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what I want to say. I only like you.&#34; Under the dim light, Toby&#39;s eyes were bright. I knew that he liked me, but I felt that he had only been with me for too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t found your mate yet. Don&#39;t spend so much time on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mate again. All of you talk about mate, but I can&#39;t control myself from not liking you.&#34; Toby left his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited for a while, but Toby still did not come back. This made me anxious. Toby was in a very bad state. He would not leave me directly. I looked for him in the direction he left. The air in the bar was mixed. I carefully looking for him and finally smelled a little of Toby&#39;s mint scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed the smell to the warehouse at the back door of the bar. It was dark and there was no one. I wanted to turn on the light to take a look, but a person held my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person opposite me pressed me against the wall. I could smell a fresh mint smell. &#34;Toby? Is that you?&#34; But the person did not respond. I turned on the light with my other hand with difficulty. The Toby in front of me startled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to you?&#34; I asked him because he looked very strange. Toby&#39;s dark brown eyes turned black and his throat let out heavy breathing. I guessed that he was controlled by his wolf Akio. I tried to appease him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Akio, relax. Let me go first, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Akio ignored me. He bit the skin on my neck with his teeth. I was pressed against the wall by Toby. I could feel the heat of his lower body rubbing against my body. Oh no, he was in rut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;&#34;Stop!&#34; I ordered Akio, but he acted as if he didn&#39;t hear me. He still tore my clothes. The smell of Isaac marking on my body made Akio angry. He bit my mark. Nicole was so anxious because of his movements that she wanted to jump out to stop Toby. But I was afraid that she would hurt Toby. I wanted to push him away, but he held me tightly. Akio&#39;s hand touched my body, which completely infuriated Nicole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole snatched the control over me. She bit Akio&#39;s neck. Akio released me because of the pain. Nicole jumped onto Akio&#39;s back and strangled Akio&#39;s neck from behind. Akio was also enraged. He threw Nicole off his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole rolled on the ground. Then she transformed. She pounced on Akio and bit his arm. Akio also shifted. He knocked Nicole over with a claw. I had never seen Akio so violent. What on earth happened to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t let them fight like this. This way, we would die here. I took back control and turned back into human form. Akio directly pounced on me. I could feel his rough fur rubbing against my skin. I looked at Akio&#39;s eyes and chanted the spell. I was not sure if this spell would work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I became a real witch, I found that I could use my ability to read minds and control others. But this ability was very difficult to master. I only succeeded once. But now it must succeed. Akio looked at me with eyes that were no longer clear. They were full of desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop! &#34;I ordered Akio in my mind. His movements paused a little. I quickly escaped from his body. He shook his head. Sure enough, I still failed? Fortunately, I escaped his control. Akio continued to rush towards me. I used my own blood to draw a magic array under my feet. I dodged Akio&#39;s attack. When he stood on the magic array, I chanted an incantation and activated the magic array.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A powerful shockwave spread out from the ground. It was like an explosion. Akio was blown to the side and fainted. I breathed a sigh of relief and knelt on the ground. Controlling other people&#39;s mind was very exhausting for me. Even if I only succeeded for a second, I was as tired as if I had just finished a marathon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, I got up from the ground. When I walked to Toby, he had already returned to his human form. I felt his body temperature and pulse. Fortunately, he had returned to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My movements woke Toby up from his coma. He looked at me and said, &#34;What happened just now? I was in so much pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Akio was out of control. He wanted to attack me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hurt? I just felt confused and I couldn&#39;t remember anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Do you know the reason why Akio suddenly became like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ever since I left my seat, I felt very anxious. Akio directly jumped out and snatched the control. Akio listened to me very much. He had never been like this before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you were very normal before. Until...&#34; For some reason, the waiter&#39;s face suddenly appeared in my mind. The bar was very dark, and I could not see his face clearly. But I always felt that his face was very familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see the waiter who served me the wine? He was a little strange.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t notice. I was still angry at that time. Do you remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too lazy to argue with him. I pulled Toby back to the bar counter. &#34;Who sent me the wine just now?&#34; I asked the bartender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought about it and said, &#34;A newcomer who just came today. Is there a problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly went to our table to find the wine glass that Toby had drunk, but only the wine glass that he used was taken away. So the waiter was targeting me? Toby was just unlucky enough to drink my wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carefully recalled the face of the waiter just now in my mind. I had definitely seen him somewhere. Then this face coincided with the face in my memory. In order to disguise himself, he covered his eyes with glasses and wore a furry fake beard to cover his face shape. Very smart, Neil.</p>
