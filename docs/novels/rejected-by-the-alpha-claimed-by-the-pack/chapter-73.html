                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After returning to Crimson Shadow Pack, I immediately carried out my investigation of Blood Moon Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my credit, there were already some records of Blood Moon Pack in the wolf pack&#39;s information, but I quickly fell into contemplation as I looked at that information on the file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood Moon Pack was a wolf pack that was in a relatively remote place. This pack rarely communicated with other packs as if they were deliberately hiding their information, which made the doubts inside me deepen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to Crimson Shadow Pack&#39;s records, there was no grudge between our pack and Blood Moon Pack, so why did they want to make a move against Claudia? I looked through all that information and couldn&#39;t find the reason, at this time I heard a voice coming from outside the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Alpha Isaac, you look like you&#39;re in the middle of something, can I help you?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted my head at this time, and a serious middle-aged man&#39;s face appeared in front of me, a thin beard lining his cheeks, he had short, dry white hair and broad cheeks full of power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the first intelligence officer in charge of all Crimson Shadow Pack&#39;s intelligence, Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some anticipation appeared in my mind and I looked at him seriously. &amp;quot;Do you know more about Blood Moon Pack?&amp;quot; I said as I pushed the information on the table half a palm towards his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Blood Moon Pack?&amp;quot; a thoughtful look appeared on Lux&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m sorry, in the recently acquired information, I&#39;m only able to know that Blood Moon Pack&#39;s Alpha possesses great power, other than that, I don&#39;t know any more than this information.&amp;quot; Lux lowered his head and looked apologetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at his apologetic look, I dragged my chin, pondered for three seconds, and then my voice took on a serious tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Blood Moon Pack sent someone to cause harm to our Crimson Shadow Pack&#39;s Luna, and they seem to want to kidnap her, which is something I absolutely cannot allow.&amp;quot; Speaking of this, killing intent appeared inside my voice. &amp;quot;You find a way to investigate all the information you can about this wolf pack for me, and send someone to pay attention to the movements of this pack, we will probably have to start a war with this wolf pack.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lux was a little surprised, but soon his face appeared with an expression of understanding. &amp;quot;This wolf pack trying to harm our Luna is indeed unforgivable, Alpha Isaac, you can rest assured that this matter is in my hands, I will definitely give you an answer within a week.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that I saw Lux leave the intelligence office, and I was once again in deep thought at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Caesar? Do you have any opinion about this matter?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I have a hunch that this wolf pack is definitely not as simple as it seems, and I think we should take fuller measures.&amp;quot; Caesar&#39;s voice answered inside my head, and at the same time, I could feel his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia was our mate, and any enemy that threatened our mate would face our bloody wrath, and I could feel that Caesar&#39;s anger was no less than mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath at this time and proceeded to walk towards the outside of the intelligence office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia now had our child inside her belly, and as long as there was nothing urgent, I had to be by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I absolutely cannot let what happened last time happen again, I wanted her to enjoy the best protection during her pregnancy, and just as I thought of this, an aroma reached my nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This smell was fresh cake, and I thought Claudia would like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of my mouth showed a smile at this time, and then I turned around and walked towards the cake store down the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days in the wolf pack were full, and I spent every day with Claudia&#39;s side while waiting for news from Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I returned to the packhouse at noon on the third day, I saw a woman with black hair and purple pupils by Claudia&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Miranda, you came to our wolf pack is ......?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac, I want to learn higher witchcraft, Miranda came to our wolf pack to instruct me in witchcraft.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia and Miranda sat very close to each other, they seemed to be reading the same witchcraft book, I looked at the close relationship between Claudia and Miranda heart relaxed a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Blood Moon Pack thing might keep me busy, but having Miranda by Claudia&#39;s side would give me a lot of peace of mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Miranda, thank you so much for teaching Claudia.&amp;quot; I turned my voice to sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I will have my people give you more access, and you can come to me for any problems you encounter in Crimson Shadow Pack that you cannot solve.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No need to be so polite, I can only feel pleasure in being able to teach a witch with such a powerful talent as Claudia.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two more days passed once again, and that wasn&#39;t even a week before I saw Lux rushing into my office gasping out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is this something urgent that has happened?&amp;quot; Looking at his appearance, I stopped what I was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Alpha Isaac, about the Blood Moon Pack, they&#39;re starting to make big moves!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What? What big move has happened?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyebrows furrowed at this time, I felt a bad premonition, like the feeling of being about to be overwhelmed by wind and rain on a rainy day, this feeling of danger appeared in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s war.&amp;quot; Lux&#39;s face began to look heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Blood Moon Pack, for some reason, is waging war like crazy, and they used just three days to destroy a small wolf pack that was very close to him!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Three days!&amp;quot; I jerked up from my seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, just three days, after they destroyed that small wolf pack, now they are once again waging war on other wolf packs as if they have no purpose just for war, they are really crazy!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;There is actually such a thing.&amp;quot; I knew at this point that my bad premonition had come true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood Moon Pack had destroyed a small pack in just three days, although it was only a small pack, it was a pack, after all, even Crimson Shadow Pack would have a hard time doing that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood Moon Pack was likely to hide a very terrifying power, which was a huge threat, and since this wolf pack had once struck at Claudia, then the object of their war afterward would probably be Crimson Shadow Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without engaging in too much hesitation, I instantly began to walk toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Lux, you continue to observe Blood Moon Pack&#39;s movements, now I have to immediately start preparations to deal with the war, I have a hunch that Blood Moon Pack&#39;s purpose is definitely not simple!&amp;quot;</p>
