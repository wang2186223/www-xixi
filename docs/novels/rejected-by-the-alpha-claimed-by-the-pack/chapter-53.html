                <p>In fact, the White Claw pack does not welcome Isaac&#39;s arrival, but they are very surprised that I am Isaac&#39;s mate. They have never heard of any witch becoming pack&#39;s Luna. Although they respect me very much, the werewolf has always been biased against witches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Richard invited us to meet at his home. He almost thought that Isaac was his family because he recognized him at first sight when he saw Isaac. Richard stared at Isaac&#39;s face and said, &#34;It&#39;s too similar!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby received this arrangement unexpectedly. I always felt that his relationship with Isaac was better than what they showed on the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really didn&#39;t expect Claudia to be your mate.&#34; Richard said to Isaac, &#34;Claudia is a powerful witch. I found her through many people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve been mates for a long time. I wasn&#39;t in pack when she was a witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I invited you here this time to tell you about your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only know that he is your former Alpha.&#34; Isaac finally became interested in what Richard said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he was our former Alpha and the strongest of us. If he hadn&#39;t chosen to protect us, he would have survived.&#34; Richard said with sadness on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember that you suffered heavy casualties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, all of us survived with the help of your father. But if he didn&#39;t choose to save us but gave everything to his wolf, he would win the war.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will he win a war with such a large number of people?&#34; I asked Richard. I read about this war from the books. The difference in numbers between them was very shocking. It was reasonable that White Claw pack would lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he is so strong. This wolf&#39;s ability can only be possessed by your direct descendants, blood relatives. So you should be the only one who has the ability now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s face changed. He must have thought of the same thing as me. He said to Richard, &#34;I am not sure if Caesar has activated this ability. I have been a little unable to control him recently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not sure either. I am just his cousin. We have never seen your father&#39;s wolf. He is usually strong enough.&#34; I always feel that Richard is talking about Isaac himself. &#34;But those who have seen the wolf are either dead or seriously injured. They are all very secretive about your father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked Richard, &#34;He has been having nightmares recently. Is there a connection?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe. Is it going to be a full moon soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it related to the full moon?&#34; Isaac asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure, but your father locks himself at home when he is a full moon. We don&#39;t know what happened. He will be tired the next day, but he looks fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never heard my mother say this.&#34; Isaac sounded a little disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She must be too sad to mention it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I know. Thank you for inviting me over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We owe your father this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard invited us to have dinner at his house. Toby and Isaac had a rare peaceful night. On the surface, they stared at each other at the table. I knew they were quarreling with their minds, but they seemed to have forgotten that except for Toby and me, everyone here could connect them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Toby! What did you say to Alpha Isaac?&#34; Richard spoke first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was the one who laughed at me first!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Toby!&#34; Luna&#39;s voice became stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, mother.&#34; Toby lowered his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby&#39;s brothers were holding back their laughter. The corners of Isaac&#39;s mouth also curled up slightly. I was very happy that he could have a new family. Toby&#39;s family was very warm. This was what I had always wanted Isaac to feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am very happy that you are Crimson Shadow pack&#39;s leader,&#34; Luna asked me. &#34;Toby did not cause trouble for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he often helped me and saved my life. I am very grateful to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Toby told me that you are very puzzled about Luna&#39;s duty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A little. I am a witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think it is a disadvantage. Luna&#39;s powerful ability is very important. You have just become Luna. You have to adapt slowly. The most important thing is that your Alpha will support you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac supports me very much. I think he is going to spoil me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haha, I can see that you have a good relationship. The relationship between Alpha and Luna is also very important to pack. You have to let it be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, I got it,&#34; Isaac asked me with his eyes. I smiled at him. I could no longer affect my mate with anxiety. He was not in a good state of mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After we returned to pack, Isaac&#39;s nightmare continued. He always woke up in the middle of the night. I tried a lot of medicine for calmness, but it was useless. The doctor could not find anything. Through Richard&#39;s description, I checked a lot of books, but there was no record of Isaac&#39;s situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, this did not affect Isaac&#39;s work. He became busier and busier. Tomorrow was the full moon. This full moon was the brightest time of the year. On the night of the full moon, Isaac did not intend to go out to avoid accidents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was going to stay at home with Isaac until I received the letter. I did not know who sent the letter. The words on the note were pieced together, but the things in the envelope made my hair stand on end. A knife stained with blood, on which was the smell of Toby&#39;s blood. It was written on the note. &#34;If you don&#39;t want him to die, come to the forest in the east of pack alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I contacted Toby, but he did not respond at all. Panic took over my heart, and the bad premonition of things made my hands tremble. This was obviously a trap, but I could not watch Toby get into trouble. I brought enough medicine and Isaac&#39;s mercury gun. The location of the note was outside of the pack, and the other party was likely to be rouge. If there were not many people, I could deal with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not want to ask Isaac to go with me. He was now doing a follow-up in the hospital, and his condition was very bad. I did not want anything to happen to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came to the place on the note. I didn&#39;t know if it was because of the full moon, but the woods were illuminated by the moonlight and the fog that could not be dispersed. I waited there for a while, and I heard a few people approaching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was indeed rouge&#39;s territory. rouge surrounded me, and there were only three to five people on the opposite side. I could still cope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Toby?&#34; I put my hand on the water silver spear at my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What Toby?&#34; rouge was puzzled by my question. &#34;We came here because a young lady said that she would give us a big gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What miss?&#34; I suddenly felt a tiny sting on the back of my neck like a needle. I touched there and felt an anesthetic dart. I turned to look behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona looked at me with her arms crossed and smiled. The scenery in front of me suddenly spun and my strength was lost in my body. I could only kneel on the ground to support myself from falling down. She squatted beside me and stabbed a small needle into my arm. After a few seconds, my consciousness blurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The effect of this medicine is really good. Do you know how many days I have been looking to find the medicine against witches?&#34; Fiona shouted to the group of rouge, &#34;This is my gift to you. She is a rare witch. Of course, it&#39;s the same for me if you treat her as a tool for venting your desires.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My limbs lost the strength to support me and I fell to the ground. &#34;Bitch.&#34; I used all the strength in my body to say this word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona kicked me in the stomach and &#34;enjoyed the rest of your time.&#34; She walked further and further away in my blurry vision.</p>
