                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I finally understand Miranda&#39;s words.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the wall made of vines in front of me and fell into a lasting shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This witchcraft I hadn&#39;t even learned before, but when I used my mind ability to recite it, I actually succeeded in launching it just once, and it took just under two seconds to recite the spell!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ability not only could speed up the use of witchcraft, but could also strengthen my ability to learn witchcraft, so this was the true power of my bloodline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out that it had been hidden in my body all along. I didn&#39;t discover it until today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The excitement almost filled my body at this time, and there was no way I could continue to wait here and quickly used some of those attack witchcraft that I had learned from my memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fireball, vine winding, vine barriers, poisonous flowers, lightning, just a little while, the entire training ground was covered by a variety of witchcraft, countless colors and light flashed in front of my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These spells that I would normally take several seconds to be able to use, were now able to be activated in just a split second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is this what power feels like?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at my hands in disbelief, and I discovered the power of my eyes once again at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was using the power of my mind to activate witchcraft, I could vaguely feel that my soul and mind were slowly improving, and this improvement would make me more energetic, which meant that I would be able to use witchcraft more often.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;And about defensive witchcraft.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the open space in front of me at this time, and the next moment, along with a short incantation running inside my mind, my world created a change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just a moment&#39;s work, I disappeared from my spot and proceeded to a place ten feet in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the witch&#39;s higher spatial witchcraft, and a witchcraft I had learned to prevent me from being attacked by my enemies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By using this witchcraft while I was under their control, I would break away from the enemy&#39;s control and quickly teleport within ten feet of where I could see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The incantation for this teleportation witchcraft was relatively short, but it had taken me two seconds to recite it in the past, and if I could actually achieve instantaneous activation continuously, I could hardly imagine any enemy being able to control me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weakness of being a witch had almost completely disappeared from my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Great ......&amp;quot; I felt some liquid slowly filling up from inside my eyes, I had become so strong now that if I continued to learn some more of those higher witchcraft, I could barely imagine how strong I would be, maybe in the future I really could have the terrifying power to help a kingdom win a war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now I can really help Isaac.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I became firm inside at this time, the old me was always protected by Isaac, now I also had the opportunity that I could protect Isaac, I could use this power to guard my pack and guard the love between Isaac and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Nicole, really thank you for the reminder, you made me find the use of my real power, otherwise I didn&#39;t think I would comprehend the power of my bloodline so quickly.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s your own talent.&amp;quot; Nicole also seemed a little shocked by my ability, but soon I could sense a little loss within her emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, I have a feeling that you will become a very powerful witch.&amp;quot; Her voice paused for a moment here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;On the contrary, I may become less helpful to you, and you may not need my power as much.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to Nicole&#39;s voice, I quickly understood the reason for her loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, if I became strong by the witch&#39;s power, maybe I wouldn&#39;t need the power to transform into a wolf so much anymore, but Nicole was my wolf after all, my other self that had accompanied me until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Nicole, maybe this power isn&#39;t as strong as one of us either, the witch&#39;s close-combat ability has always been a weakness, and I still think you can still be of very great help to me.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, you don&#39;t have to comfort me, I know that.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Nicole&#39;s voice become more downcast, and then her voice disappeared inside my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was silent at this time, although I gained great power, but I have no way to fight with my wolf together?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a little sad, but the power of my witch was indeed something I could not give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to protect my child with Isaac by being strong enough to provide Isaac with my power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed at this time, since I did not know what to do now, then with let it change, perhaps Nicole&#39;s power was indispensable to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes at this time and inhaled a breath of air, the slight heat inside my nasal cavity made me lift my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know when it was now noon, the sun was at its peak and the hottest time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not have a clear perception of the power of my strength now, maybe I should go to the army training ground and test my real strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The distance between the army&#39;s training ground and this place was a little far, but there was no way to extinguish the flame of excitement in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked quickly along the Crimson Shadow Pack road towards the army&#39;s training ground until the sound that almost shot up into the sky rushed to my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the sound of a squad in training. I looked across a few hundred feet to the training ground of the warriors, where there were strong wolves, who were following Isaac&#39;s orders to carry out various training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really didn&#39;t know how Isaac would look when he saw my current strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought excitedly, although I used to come to the training ground to visit Isaac, but never once as excited as today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued to approach the training ground, and soon some warriors in training spotted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Luna Claudia, did you come to visit Alpha Isaac today too?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Strange, why is Luna Claudia here so early today, she used to come at the end of training.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warriors&#39; puzzled voices reached my ears, but some of them also started greeting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Where&#39;s Isaac?&amp;quot; I looked at the warriors inquiringly. &amp;quot;Isaac is in the innermost command room, he&#39;s working on a new training plan.&amp;quot; The warrior answered me seriously. &amp;quot;That is, he is working?&amp;quot; I had some hesitation at this point, as much as I wanted him to see my current power, I didn&#39;t want to disturb him, maybe it would be good to get some warriors to test my current power. Thinking about it I looked to the other warriors in training. &amp;quot;I&#39;m going to use the witch&#39;s powers to challenge you now. Let&#39;s get ten of you together to attack me at the same time.&amp;quot; I looked confidently at some of those warriors, but their expressions went as if they didn&#39;t believe what I was saying. &amp;quot;Ten people?&amp;quot; All the warriors looked full of surprise, and they didn&#39;t follow my orders. &amp;quot;Luna Claudia, aren&#39;t you pregnant? You can&#39;t transform into a wolf now, so how can you possibly challenge ten warriors?&amp;quot; These warriors seemed to think I was joking, and no one performed any other actions. &amp;quot;I&#39;m serious, and even if all ten of you are together, you are not my opponent.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Impossible!&amp;quot; Someone in the crowd once again let out a shocked cry, and a strong man who looked much taller than the other warriors stepped forward. &amp;quot;Claudia, even if you&#39;re the Luna of our wolf pack, then you can&#39;t joke about the dignity of our warriors, there&#39;s no way for you, a pregnant werewolf, to take on ten warriors at the same time!&amp;quot; His face didn&#39;t look too good, and his voice turned firm. &amp;quot;You&#39;re insulting the strength of us, we&#39;re</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the warriors inquiringly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac is in the innermost command room, he&#39;s working on a new training plan.&amp;quot; The warrior answered me seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;That is, he is working?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had some hesitation at this point, as much as I wanted him to see my current power, I didn&#39;t want to disturb him, maybe it would be good to get some warriors to test my current power.</p>
