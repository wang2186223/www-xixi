                <p>I looked at several corpses on the ground with some. These people ended their lives at the same time as if they had made an appointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surroundings began to become chaotic, the traveling passersby began to run towards the distance, they tried to get away from the place, while the guards of the White Pack surrounded the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held Claudia and started walking towards the bodies on the ground in the distance. These werewolves all seemed to have some strange liquid coming out of the corners of their mouths, their faces with determination, it looked as if they all ended their own lives through poison after they knew they had no way to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of enemy was actually so vicious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face became gloomy, and at this time I saw a strong werewolf with white hair come out among the guards of the White Pack. This werewolf looked about forty years old, with some surprise and anger on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Distinguished guests, I am sorry that you were attacked within the boundaries of our territory.&amp;quot; This werewolf looked at me with an apologetic look on his face. &amp;quot;I am Beta of the White Pack, I will definitely investigate the identity of these attackers, and all your spending in our pack in the past few days will be free of charge.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Beta of the White Pack?&amp;quot; I looked at him with a frown. Because of the safety and beauty of the White Pack, that&#39;s why I brought Claudia here for our honeymoon, but I didn&#39;t expect this to happen, these people actually dared to hurt my Claudia!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Your security doesn&#39;t look as good as the word has it.&amp;quot; My voice sank, anger and killing intent still in my chest not dispelled, I felt Caesar was cranky inside my head, but I didn&#39;t know what my enemy&#39;s purpose was now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing my voice, Beta of the White Pack seemed to have some embarrassment on his face, but soon he turned his head and anger appeared on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You guys immediately take these bodies away, let the doctor investigate the cause of their death, and also dispatch a few powerful werewolves to specifically protect the safety of these two guests!&amp;quot; After saying that, he once again looked at me with apologies inside his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Guest, our pack forbids this kind of thing to happen. People who do it in our pack will not only become the enemies of our pack, but also the enemies of other wolf packs. Please believe that I will definitely give you an answer tomorrow morning.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at his sincere expression, I took a deep breath at this time, suppressed the anger in my heart, and then carried Claudia into the pumpkin carriage waiting at the entrance of the park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw several guards of the White Pack following us, and the whole pack seemed to come to life in the night, and the silence of the White Pack was broken by this sudden change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night seemed to become long, and through the hotel window, I could see the increased guards nearby, as well as the busy staff. An attack on the territory of the White Pack definitely had a great impact on the reputation of the Pack, and their swift action also made me feel more at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia seemed to be sleeping heavily in my arms at this time, and the attackers seemed to be aiming only to take her away, using only a kind of psychedelic drug that made her unconscious but had no other effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, I swear I will not leave your side next, and I will find all the attackers.&amp;quot; I stroked Claudia&#39;s cheek and looked at her sleeping face with an additional fierceness in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After placing Claudia on the hotel bed, I looked at the ceiling overhead and my thoughts began to spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who had attacked Claudia?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked my memory, and the only person who had a grudge against me and was still alive seemed to be Fiona, but hadn&#39;t she been given to a rogue?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she made the rogues listen to her orders, in the face of the powerful White Pack, it was almost impossible for the rogues to enter the territory of the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a black shadow hidden inside my back, someone was looking at me with a malicious gaze from behind, but I had no idea who that person was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pondered in the hotel bed, holding Claudia in my arms, watching her quietly sleeping, and I didn&#39;t know how long it took before I fell into sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time the sleep seemed shallow, and I felt a mere blink of an eye before I snapped my eyes open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia was still asleep next to me, and the sun was just beginning to blossom its rays outside the window. I sat up from the bed, but my movement woke Claudia up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac, what&#39;s happening to me ......?&amp;quot; Claudia had some confusion and rubbed her eyes, but the next moment her face suddenly changed, filled with a bit of alarm and looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I remember, a few werewolves put me in a coma through some drugs!&amp;quot; After saying that, she began to stroke her cheeks and body. I held her tight at this time with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s okay, all those people are dead, you don&#39;t have to worry.&amp;quot; I looked at her wary look. Some pity appeared in my heart, I wrapped her with my power to try to make her feel a little more secure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac ......&amp;quot; I could feel some trembling in her body, but her trembling made my heart even angrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was still our child inside her belly, but there was no way for a werewolf to transform into a wolf while carrying a pup, and I could almost imagine her desperation in the face of these werewolves with no way to fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac, I&#39;m trying to say that those who attacked me are not simple.&amp;quot; Claudia looked at me with her green eyes, she knew everything I was thinking right now, but she hugged me tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I had felt the footsteps of these people before they attacked me, but I let my guard down because I didn&#39;t feel them with malice.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;There was no way to feel their emotions?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, it&#39;s not just that.&amp;quot; Claudia&#39;s voice gradually took on some fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;When they had me under control, I tried to use my witch&#39;s ability to read their minds, but it didn&#39;t work! In the middle of their eyebrows, there seemed to be a hidden magic mark interfering with my ability.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Magic mark, could it be that there is a witch behind these attackers?&amp;quot; My brow furrowed even more at this point. I couldn&#39;t imagine any of my enemies possessing a witch, it was as if they had prepared themselves to target Claudia before they struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t know ......,&amp;quot; Claudia&#39;s voice began to take on some loss. &amp;quot;I relied too much on my werewolf powers before, and most of my magic was for defense or perception. It felt like everything was going in a good direction, so I gradually let my guard down, but to my surprise, when there was no way to transform into a wolf, I actually had no power to resist those few enemies.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lost voice made my heart seize up. I almost rarely saw her in such a state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, I&#39;ll definitely investigate.&amp;quot; I wrapped Claudia in my arms with the sheet and tried to comfort her, but at this time I heard a knock at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Guests, this is Beta of the White Pack, the identity of those attackers has been investigated clearly.&amp;quot;</p>
