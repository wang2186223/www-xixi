                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s knife had already stabbed into Neil&#39;s chest. However, the knife did not go deep into his chest. It only pierced his skin. Isaac&#39;s eyes changed between red and gold. Isaac&#39;s mother, Victoria, shouted to Isaac, &#34;Don&#39;t kill him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look into my eyes.&#34; I held his face. &#34;Isaac, I know you can hear me and control yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes slowly turned back to normal gold. Neil had already fainted. Victoria said to Isaac, &#34;Are you going to kill your younger brother&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to tell her that Isaac couldn&#39;t control himself just now, but he spoke first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac covered his head. &#34;Do you know what he did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No matter what he did, he is your younger brother!&#34; Victoria was very excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This has nothing to do with you. Go back quickly.&#34; Isaac&#39;s tone was full of exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria said to him, &#34;Although he is the child of me and Andre, Andre is no longer here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This has nothing to do with Andre! Go, I don&#39;t want to find someone to force you away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am a mother, Isaac! I have nothing now, only you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He kept saying that he wanted to kill me. He also kidnapped my mate!&#34; Isaac finally couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore and roared at Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victoria finally lowered his voice. &#34;I don&#39;t know what he did, but...&#34; She knelt on the ground and begged Isaac, &#34;I beg you. I will take him to my mother&#39;s pack. I will watch over him so that he will never appear in front of you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I beg you...&#34; Victoria&#39;s voice trembled. Isaac still could not refuse her. He helped Victoria up from the ground. He still let Victoria take Neil away. I gently pressed his temple with my hand. &#34;This may be the best solution. You will regret killing your own younger brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never regret killing him, but my mother is too pitiful. She once sacrificed a lot for me. I can&#39;t hurt her anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; I wrapped my arms around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, Neil was taken away by Victoria. pack&#39;s people wondered why Neil left. Victoria could only tell everyone that Neil was seriously ill and had to go to another pack for treatment. Otherwise, with Neil&#39;s reputation and crime, he would definitely be exiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Victoria left, she came to me and said to me, &#34;I apologize to you for what I did before. You are a good mate to Isaac. I am just an incompetent mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t say that. Isaac is very grateful to you.&#34; I used to be very afraid and even hated this indifferent queen. But she was also a poor mother. She should be in pain after being deceived by Andre for so many years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Although you have changed a lot this time, I can see that you are still a kind person. Can I ask you to do something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what you want to say. I will take good care of Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; When Victoria left, she kissed the side of Isaac&#39;s face. The reluctance in her eyes was true. She might never return to the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; I asked Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; Isaac lowered his head. I could not see his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Victoria left, Dean came to us. He said to Isaac, &#34;What reason do you have to refuse now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you let me go?&#34; Isaac said helplessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, everyone is waiting for you. pack can&#39;t live without Alpha. Everyone wants you to be our Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me ask my mate.&#34; Isaac suddenly asked me, &#34;Are you willing to be our pack&#39;s Luna?&#34; I hated him and he turned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean looked at me expectantly. I didn&#39;t know how to respond. I had never thought about how to be a pack&#39;s Luna. I glared at Isaac, but he only put on an innocent expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if giving up, I sighed. &#34;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m a witch. They won&#39;t recognize me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whether they admit it or not, you are my mate.&#34; Isaac looked into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you agree?&#34; Dean asked Isaac. Isaac looked at him and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will immediately announce to pack that we will hold a huge ceremony for this.&#34; Dean looked very excited. He had really waited for this for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have been here for several months. Now is their happiest day. Everyone is celebrating because of the new Alpha. There are always drunk people on the street. Dean is a little worried. He asked Isaac,&#34; Alpha, should we control them? &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them go,&#34; Isaac said to him, &#34;It&#39;s been a tough couple of months for everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was much busier than before. He had to deal with a lot of the mess left by Andre and Neil. He was a very good Alpha, but I didn&#39;t know how to be a good Luna. I didn&#39;t know if it was because Isaac was too outstanding that he announced that I was pack&#39;s Luna, people didn&#39;t overreact. They were all immersed in joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you thinking about?&#34; Isaac sat behind his desk and waved at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked over and he pulled me to his lap. &#34;It&#39;s nothing. Let me go. What if someone comes in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see anything wrong with me holding my Luna.&#34; The tip of his nose rubbed against my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the office!&#34; I felt a slight itch on my cheek because of his movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My office.&#34; Isaac put his hand on my thigh, and sparks flew wherever he touched me. He kissed the mark on the back of my neck, and I made a comfortable sound from my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly there was a rapid knock on the door, and I immediately stood up from Isaac. Isaac pointed to my chest, and I quickly buttoned up my shirt. His hand was too fast, and I didn&#39;t even notice when his clothes had been undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person who came in was Toby. I had been with Isaac these days, and I hadn&#39;t seen him much. &#34;It&#39;s you!&#34; I gave him a big hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a long time. How does it feel to be Luna?&#34; Toby asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s pretty good.&#34; Isaac was dissatisfied with our neglect of him He coughed behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Isaac asked Toby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to negotiate on behalf of White Claw pack. Thanks to the two unreliable Alpha in front of you, our negotiation has been delayed for a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go back and tell your father that I will not fight. This is my promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it so casual? Even if I believe you, how are you going to convince the warriors who killed their families?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will draft a paper agreement. No one here wants to fight now. But if you attack first, I can promise you that you will definitely lose miserably.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. There is one more thing...&#34; Toby looked at me, hesitating to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need me to give you some space?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac said, &#34;Just say it. Claudia and I have no secrets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby said to Isaac, &#34;Well, actually my father wants to see you. He is very grateful to your biological father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked at me and I said to him, &#34;Alpha Richard is a very good person. He will not do anything to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will go when I have time. Help me thank him for his invitation,&#34; Isaac said to Toby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby was about to leave the office. &#34;Wait!&#34; I stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Isaac with expectant eyes. He sighed. &#34;Well, you go. But remember that we have an appointment tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember.&#34; I pushed Toby out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby complained to me, &#34;Isaac just quarreled with me in my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am curious about what the content is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just congratulated him on becoming Alpha?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said he sat behind his desk like a mafia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be glad that Isaac became more steady after he became Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be honest, it was quite similar, especially when he looked down at others with a mercury gun. But if he really shouted, he should be smashed by Isaac&#39;s gun butt. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t mention this in front of him in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are really biased. He called me boy, and you never helped me refute. I came to see you on purpose this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because your childish temper makes you look much younger than us. I dare not say this to him, and he will definitely be angry. So I can only say, &#34;Thank you for coming to see me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now there are only the two of us. You can tell the truth. What do you think about becoming Luna?&#34; Toby was really sharp when it came to people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. I am very happy to become Isaac&#39;s Luna. But I don&#39;t know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he say?&#34; He was referring to Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac didn&#39;t give me any pressure. This is what makes me uneasy. He is a very outstanding Alpha. He has made a lot of preparations to become Alpha since he was a child. But I didn&#39;t. I used to be a slave and now I am a witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t expect you to be so unconfident.&#34; Toby had a puzzled expression on his face. &#34;You are the most beautiful and powerful werewolf I have ever seen. This is not to comfort you. I am telling the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone has times when they are not confident. If I let you replace your father as Alpha now, are you confident?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My elder brother will inherit Alpha. I never thought about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is it. I have never thought of being Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can ask my mother. She is the best Luna I have ever seen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil was sent to another pack by his mother. I have lost my last ally. Isaac sent people everywhere to search for me. He must still hate me for kidnapping Claudia. Fortunately, the pack has been in a party these days. No one noticed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn witch, after she came back, she took away everything that should have belonged to me. The envious eyes of the others would have looked at me. Most importantly, my position as Luna was also taken away by her. What right does she have to be Luna? A damn slave. My status is much higher than hers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But those damn commoners were discussing, &#34;She is a witch, but she is also a werewolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe in Moon Goddess. Alpha&#39;s mate must be our Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even children said that our Luna is the most beautiful of all packs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swear, I will make her live a life worse than death! I will dig out her damned green eyes! So I found my &#39;friend&#39;. He is a businessman from the black market. Neil once forced me to introduce the businessman to him, but who would have thought that he was so stupid that he could make a mistake in medicine?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure this is useful? I am not going to deal with ordinary witches.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, this is the medicine I have been looking for for a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night of the full moon is coming. I spent all my money on this medicine. I want them all to die, the witches and her loyal puppy, and our new Alpha.</p>
