                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Claudia disappeared, the course of my life changed dramatically. I no longer played with boys or went to bars to &#34;hang out&#34;. They didn&#39;t mean anything to me anymore. The atmosphere at home became heavier and heavier. Alpha and mother would have an argument with each other every few days. I felt like they were about to shift to wolves and scratch each other&#39;s faces off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know why they fought, it was probably that shit from the past again. So I didn&#39;t like staying home either, and I spent a lot of my free time on the outskirts of the pack. I prayed every moment that I would meet Claudia again, but I couldn&#39;t find a trace of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, when I returned home, the floor was covered with pieces from my mother&#39;s porcelain collection. And Alpha&#39;s smashed wine bottle. They just had a fight. The smell of alcohol was spreading through the air. It did nothing to hide their lingering anger. I looked at the messy room and was about to leave when Alpha snarled and called me to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop! Where have you been?&#34; Apparently the blood speckled on me stung his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The outskirts of the pack. Cleaned up a few hooligans.&#34; I didn&#39;t even want to look him in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your coach tells me you haven&#39;t been to the training ground in a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one can beat me on the training ground. I can get more of a workout out there instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think you&#39;re so capable?&#34; I could smell that Alpha was enraged by me; I hadn&#39;t spoken to him like that before. &#34;You and your mother are both bitches!&#34; With that he had reached out his claws and wanted to attack my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>! In shock, my body made a subconscious move to fight back. I held Alpha&#39;s wrist and slammed him to the ground on his back, then put a claw against his carotid artery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to kill me!?&#34; He growled, his throat vibrating beneath my claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately put my claws away. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Father. I was subconscious....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I finished my words, Alpha gave me a slap. He didn&#39;t retract his claw, so the left side of my vision slowly turned bright red. &#34;You can&#39;t wait to be the Alpha, can you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Father, I just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even try to listen to my explanation. &#34;Then, don&#39;t even think about it for the rest of your life, the next Alpha will be Neil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him with wide eyes, though one of them might be blind. Watching my reaction, Alpha gave a satisfied smile. &#34;I should have done this a long time ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still digesting the devastating news when Alpha had thrown me out. Now I could only think of my mother, who had mentioned something about my identity. Caesar smelled my mother&#39;s location, and she was indeed at home, but I hadn&#39;t even seen her earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, I found my mother in a locked room. Hell, she still had Alpha&#39;s guards at the door. I felt even more uneasy inside. It wasn&#39;t until late at night that I snuck into my mother&#39;s room through the window. Mother wasn&#39;t surprised to see me coming. There were still red palm marks on her beautiful face. I clenched my fists and approached my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay? What the hell is going on here?&#34; I asked my mother in a soft tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He put me under house arrest. But don&#39;t worry, he only dares to do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, not knowing what would happen to my mother now. I told her I was no longer the heir, but I needed the truth so badly. I could only tell her everything that had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; My mother&#39;s voice was so angry that I&#39;d never heard it before. &#34;This liar, he promised me to let you be the future Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did he say yes to you?&#34; I finally said. &#34;I know I&#39;m not Alpha&#39;s biological child. What kind of deal did you make?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother looked at me in surprise, her voice sounding like she was squeezing it out of her throat. &#34;How do you know ......&#34; Then she was silent for a moment and returned to her usual familiar expression. &#34;It&#39;s not something you should know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother took my hand and looked me in the eyes. &#34;Even if he doesn&#39;t acknowledge you, you&#39;re still the strongest in the pack, and you&#39;re going to be the future Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been like this, and you still won&#39;t tell me?&#34; I really admired my mother&#39;s calmness, as if she didn&#39;t care about anything other than the position of future Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother&#39;s words were done, and she stopped giving me a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you all are the same, so I have nothing more to ask.&#34; I laughed bitterly and jumped out of the window to the river where I had met Claudia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few months ago, I thought I could protect my mate. But after I showed her a ridiculous drama that hurt her so badly, she left me. And the goals I had had since I was a kid, all the training I had done to become Alpha, and all the questions I had received because of it, they all seemed like a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t keep anything in my life successfully, and I fell to my knees by the river, pounding my fists on the ground. I scolded myself inwardly for being so weak! I slammed my fist into the gravel at the river&#39;s edge. The pain couldn&#39;t compare to what I had lost. Was it my fault for being so weak? Then another punch, and the gravel embedded itself into my flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swore to the Moon Goddess in my heart that I would shed all my weaknesses and no one would control my feelings again from today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was unusually quiet today. I hadn&#39;t seen my mother or Isaac, although Isaac had been fighting outside the pack lately and I rarely saw him. Father was upset with Isaac for this behavior, and my instincts told me that Isaac&#39;s strange behavior was because of Claudia, who left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still didn&#39;t see my mother when we ate dinner, so I had to ask my father, &#34;Where is mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my father acted like he didn&#39;t hear my question, or maybe he was just trying to change the subject. &#34;Are you confident that you can be the Alpha?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost choked on my water. &#34;Alpha? Me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father nodded &#34;Yes, you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my head, not knowing what was going through my mind. &#34;I didn&#39;t know, everyone thought Isaac was going to be the Alpha, including me. I never thought about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mention him, I&#39;m talking about you. If I want you to be the future Alpha, do you have the confidence to be good?&#34; Father hated it when I mentioned Isaac&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, as the son of Alpha, how could I not have the thought that I would be the future Alpha? Especially after I had my wolf. Finally, people would know that I was strong too, and I beat everyone on the training grounds. But who made my brother be a perfect successor? He even defeated a berserking me with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I certainly had faith, as long as there was no Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s great.&#34; Father smiled a smile that had been missing for a long time. &#34;I will announce to the pack tomorrow that you are the next Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; I was extremely surprised. &#34;What about Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That bastard, who&#39;s been hanging out with hooligans a lot lately and dared to attack me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was a bit arrogant, but he had never acted disrespectfully towards his parents. But I didn&#39;t ask this question out loud. Since father said so, Isaac deserved to be punished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Isaac had been in the limelight of everyone for so long. It was my turn now. I ignored the discomfort I felt inside and accepted my father&#39;s offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother did not appear on the occasion of announcing me as the heir. Father said she didn&#39;t come because she was in a bad condition. But I knew that my mother had always been partial to Isaac. She was hard on Isaac, but she never wanted anyone other than Isaac to be the future Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the werewolves, curious expressions on the faces of the people who had been summoned. And Isaac was under a tree in the distance, his eyes were shadowy as he looked at our father. I guessed that he&#39;d known about the punishment for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father took my hand and stood in front of the stage.&#34; I have an announcement to make today. It&#39;s very important to our pack.&#34; The people began to murmur. The smile on my father&#39;s face grew wider. &#34;You all should know him, my son Neil, and I&#39;m sure you all know his wonderful personality and have seen his bravery on the battlefield.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone agreed with my father&#39;s words, and that made me confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I&#39;ve decided that Neil should be the next Alpha.&#34; The crowd below boiled up just as my father finished his words. I didn&#39;t mean to hear the hard words, but they were shouting too loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? He is weak compared to Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jesus, if we let him be the Alpha, how many days will we still live?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These discontents knocked at my heart, and I was tempted to grab the one leading the protest by his collar and ask him if he dared to have a fight with me. When Isaac had been announced as the heir, no one had ever dared to protest. I shouted to those people in my mind. &#39;Shut up, you loser. I&#39;m so much stronger than you guys. Who are you to talk about me?&#39; I had never felt so jealous, maybe I had never faced that before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father noticed my expression was getting ugly and he cleared his throat. &#34;About Issac.&#34; The crowd fell silent for a moment. &#34;He broke the rules by associating with rogues and attacked me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd started to get rowdy again. My father didn&#39;t expect such a reaction, so he raised his voice. &#34;Silence! According to the rules, I should have executed him or banished him, but he is my child after all. So I&#39;ve decided to let him lead a hunting party and be the vanguard of our expanding territory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father hadn&#39;t told me what he was planning, but the people shut up at once. They were afraid of being a member of the hunting party too, I guessed. After all, it was the most dangerous job. As I watched their fearful faces, I suddenly felt a sense of revenge in my heart. I felt that my father had made the right decision. Isaac left after hearing the results, not a ripple on his cold face. It took away the last shred of guilt I had for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Isaac left, everyone gradually put their eyes on me and I tried to do my business best as the next Alpha. There were still some people who didn&#39;t agree with me, but more and more people were rallying around me. Fiona was a clear example of this. When my father announced that I was the Alpha, Fiona was clinging to me every day. Her attitude had changed so quickly it made me wonder if she liked Isaac or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had only been back to the pack every few months for the past two years. Every time he came back, he would catch everyone&#39;s eyes as if a hero had returned, which made me feel unpleasant. He did come back with a lot of useful information though, which made our pack&#39;s territory expand a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time he came back with a piece of information which got him and his father into another argument. When I walked into the conference room, Isaac was still wearing the same outfit he was wearing when he got back, and the situation looked somewhat urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impossible, your information must be wrong!&#34; Our father sounded arrogant, he didn&#39;t believe Isaac&#39;s information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two of our men died because we tried to find out their names.&#34; Looking at our father&#39;s indifferent face, Isaac slapped both hands on the table. &#34;They were your men too, don&#39;t you care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I said, the White Claw pack has already been destroyed by me a long time ago. Who will attack my pack, the ghosts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can do what you want, but I&#39;ve warned you.&#34; Isaac left immediately, with a complicated look on his face as he passed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked my father with worry. &#34;Isaac&#39;s information hasn&#39;t been wrong before, we should prepare for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father glared at me directly. &#34;You believe him but not me? This little bastard is just trying to trick me! How can I give him that chance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I certainly believed my father. It wasn&#39;t until three days later, while I was still asleep, that a fire had spread into my pack.</p>
