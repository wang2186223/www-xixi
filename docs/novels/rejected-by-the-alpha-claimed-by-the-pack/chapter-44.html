                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac contacted his teacher, Dean, privately. Dean was one of the pack&#39;s commanders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac told me that some commanders had already disliked Andre. Because of Andre&#39;s conceit and incompetence, the pack suffered a war that could have been avoided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean told us that he could hold a press conference for us and let us expose all of Andre&#39;s crimes. I doubted that pack&#39;s people would believe us. But Isaac told me that he had a trump card. Let me not worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean organized a lot of pack&#39;s people to come to the venue. They were all very puzzled. The commander just told them that there had something important to announce. Of course, it was not surprising that Andre came with his people. Behind him, Gordon had a security camera on his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre blocked me and Isaac. He said to Isaac, &amp;quot;Now you are a complete traitor. I order you and the commander you drew to your side to stop in the name of Alpha. Do they want to become traitors?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac protected me behind him and said to him, &amp;quot;You know best who the real traitor is. Don&#39;t block my way.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre gritted his teeth and said, &amp;quot;Do you think I will let you go up?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac tilted his head and smiled. &amp;quot;You can fight with me here. But if you can&#39;t kill me, I will tell everyone your secret. Of course, if you can&#39;t win me, just listen to me on the stretcher to tell everyone your secret.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Kill him! Kill him!&amp;quot; Andre shouted, but they hesitated and did not dare to go forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was definitely the most powerful werewolf I had ever seen. I had never seen him fight seriously with anyone. They were all afraid of the smell of blood on Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a monster that they had never come into contact with. I was very curious about what Isaac had experienced in the past two years, which made the aura around him so terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Very good.&amp;quot; He said, &amp;quot;You are not stupid enough to not be afraid of death.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and I walked to the stage. He held my hand and let me relax. He said to the microphone, &amp;quot;Today, I want to tell everyone something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It is related to our Alpha&#39;s past.&amp;quot; Isaac looked at me and said, &amp;quot;I believe that you all know her. When she was a child, you all called her the daughter of a traitor. Now, she is a witch sent by White Claw pack to negotiate.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused and took a deep breath. &amp;quot;The problem was that her parents were not traitors. Fourteen years ago, her father, who was Beta at that time, heard Andre&#39;s plan to poison the former Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father, Calvin, wanted to inform Alpha, but he could not make it in time. Andre poisoned Alpha&#39;s whole family. Then he framed Calvin and his wife and executed them.&amp;quot; The pack&#39;s people were silent because of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac continued, &amp;quot;Andre knew that there was a war at that time, and no one would investigate it carefully. Moreover, the pack was in urgent need of An Alpha, so he did this with his advisor Gordon. Their goal was to capture the pack. &amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing his words, the crowd below became noisy after a silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Andre doesn&#39;t deserve to be our Alpha!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is a lie! How could Alpha be that kind of person?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I remember that war. It turned out that Andre was the traitor of the pack.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the noisy voices, Isaac said loudly. &amp;quot;I know that many of you don&#39;t believe me. You think I took revenge because I lost the qualification to be the future Alpha. But I think you should listen to her.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna Victoria walked out from behind the curtain. I didn&#39;t expect her to be Isaac&#39;s trump card. Since I came to the Crimson Shadow pack, I didn&#39;t see Luna. I thought she didn&#39;t want to see me. It turned out that she had been under Isaac&#39;s protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna&#39;s appearance made everyone quiet down. She slowly said, &amp;quot;It&#39;s really not easy to say these things personally because I am also an insider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Isaac said is the truth, and I am also one of the sinners. These days, Andre has been coercing me and imprisoning me. Only under the protection of Isaac can I survive to this day.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Liar, you are all liars!&amp;quot; Andre did not dare to approach Isaac. He shouted in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But people just avoided him and looked at him with contempt. Andre was still struggling. &amp;quot;I am your Alpha. What they said is not true. They want to get rid of me and take my place.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone in the crowd questioned Andre, &amp;quot;Our Luna disappeared for so long, and you never said where she went.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac said to the crowd. &amp;quot;I am not using Alpha&#39;s identity to judge anyone. I don&#39;t care about this position. The people who want to judge him should be the people who lost their family in this inevitable war.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Expel him!&amp;quot; I didn&#39;t know who shouted first in the crowd, and then everyone kept shouting, &amp;quot;Expel this liar!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Kill this traitor!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, I felt extremely relaxed. It was as if a heavy chain that had been binding me for more than ten years had been lifted. The grievances and sadness in my heart overflowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used all my willpower to stop myself from crying in front of everyone. My parents were not traitors! I could finally shout out these words and not be insulted by anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac felt my emotions, and he hugged me. I finally cried in his arms. He gently stroked the back of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, it was the commanders of the pack who sentenced Andre and Gordon. They were exiled in the end. This was the judgment of all the werewolves in the pack on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t think they could live long even if they left the pack because Andrei had so many enemies out there. He could not survive simply after losing his guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby returned to the White Claw pack. He wanted to explain the current situation to his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For example, the matter of Andre being exiled and Isaac&#39;s biological father. I believed that the war between the two packs would stop soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean always hoped that Isaac could take over Alpha&#39;s position. He said that the commanders all thought so. There was no one more suitable than Isaac in the pack, but Isaac refused him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac said to Dean, &amp;quot;I remember that the pack has a legitimate heir. Where did Neil go? I know that he was deceived by Andre. No one blamed him.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean did not say anything. The commanders seemed to be very dissatisfied with Neil. He just said, &amp;quot;Alpha must be the pack&#39;s strongest werewolf. Our pack&#39;s people want you to be our Alpha.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that Isaac actually cared about my identity. I was a witch. No Alpha would be with a witch. I wanted Isaac to accept Dean&#39;s kindness. I did not care if he would announce that I was his Luna. I just wanted him to get what he deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pinched his hand and wanted to tell him my thoughts, but he whispered in my ear, &amp;quot;I don&#39;t want anything else but you.&amp;quot;</p>
