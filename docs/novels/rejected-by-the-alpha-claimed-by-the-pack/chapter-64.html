                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was definitely the most fantastic time of my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this candy land full of fairy tales, where there were many werewolves dressed up as characters in fairy tales, we watched the plays they performed, roamed between the hot air balloons and candy houses, and played the role-play of the prince and princess in front of the castle, as if I had really become a princess in a fairy tale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such happiness made me almost forget the time. We had fun, as if we were living in a fairy tale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac, is it really appropriate for you to sit here as a man?&amp;quot; I felt the temperature behind me and the corners of my mouth could not help but smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the beautiful carousel, he held me in front of him, if not for the small children around, it really looked like the image of a prince with a princess riding a horse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I think there is no problem, because no one rules that adult men can not ride the carousel.&amp;quot; Isaac answered me with a serious face, but I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at his expression with fascination, leaning against his strong chest behind me, his charming scent surrounding me. I suddenly thought at that time, maybe only children who can not walk would be carried by adults to ride the carousel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if he had really spoiled me like a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The carousel was still playing warm music, the surroundings were changing with the rotation, I looked at the park full of pink and blue, the smiles on people&#39;s faces as if they would never disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of children&#39;s laughter rang out around me, and some of them looked at Isaac behind me with curious eyes, but there was only pure curiosity in their eyes, as if they were as pure as the park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color of the sky was gradually becoming darker, but the people in the park still did not decrease, but because of the brilliantly colored lights, the park seemed more fantastic, especially when I saw the huge lollipop Ferris wheel, but also let my eyes glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the lights installed on top of the entire Ferris wheel were all turned on, hundreds of feet high towering in the sky, the light seemed to be able to reach further through the entire park. This was definitely the most beautiful and dreamy Ferris wheel I have ever seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It really is like a dream today.&amp;quot; I leaned against Isaac&#39;s chest and whispered, but I felt the strength coming from his arm at that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;A better scene you haven&#39;t seen.&amp;quot; He jumped off the carousel with me in his arms, then grabbed my wrist and walked toward the giant lollipop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What scene?&amp;quot; My voice was tinged with doubt as I looked at the giant Ferris wheel, but instead I heard his mysterious voice. &amp;quot;Confidential.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The excitement inside him passed to my heart, and the flame of anticipation seemed to be ignited, and after I got into the Ferris wheel&#39;s sightseeing car with him, we slowly rose towards the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What kind of scene is it?&amp;quot; I sat opposite Isaac in the Ferris wheel&#39;s sightseeing car, and along with the gradual increase in height, I could almost see the outline of the entire paradise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The paradise in the light appeared more fantastic and beautiful, but such a scene I felt could not be called a surprise, and Isaac&#39;s mysterious expression also denied it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Wait a little longer, I have calculated the time.&amp;quot; Isaac lifted the cuff of his suit to see the watch in his hand, and then I could feel the anticipation in his heart become even stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I even felt that his anticipation was not even less than mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he looking forward to?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curiously watched the whole park, the lights inside the park were flashing, even the moonlight overhead became dim because of them. There were no clouds in the night today, the stars in the sky seemed to be flashing with the lights of the park, they seemed to be the same eyes watching the park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Ferris wheel was slowly spinning and I could feel Isaac&#39;s emotions starting to change as the wheel spun. We came to the highest apex in the sky and I suddenly saw a change in Isaac&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, you don&#39;t blink your eyes now.&amp;quot; His voice suddenly reached my ears, and my heart skipped a beat at this time. I stared my eyes at the paradise outside the window, but in the next moment, my eyes could no longer be closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light, this was the endless light, this was the warmth and beauty that could dispel everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pupils couldn&#39;t help but dilate, and I was shocked by what I saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those hot air balloons floating in the sky actually emitted light in turn when our tour bus came to the highest point, while there were some new hot air balloons rising from the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Countless hot air balloons emitting light rushed up into the sky. We seemed to be swimming in the river of stars. These hot air balloons emitting light like endless stars surrounded us, such a strong and flashing light, I can only think of eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I rubbed my eyes because I felt some liquid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was actually moved to tears by such a beautiful sight?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, I hope we will be as eternal and beautiful as these lights.&amp;quot; Isaac&#39;s voice brought me back to reality, and we looked at each other surrounded by the glittering hot air balloons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His caramel-colored pupils were shining brightly, and through them I could see the endless light reflected in his pupils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac, I swear this is the most gorgeous image I&#39;ve ever seen.&amp;quot; I felt that my miserable childhood had been slowly healed over the past two days. Everything I was missing from my childhood was slowly being made up for by Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Do you feel any surprise?&amp;quot; Across from me, Isaac cupped my face with his hands, my cheeks were covered by the warmth of both of his hands. I looked at his loving pupils, he was spoiling me as if he was spoiling a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I mean...this really is such a surprise ......&amp;quot; I caressed his hands cupping my cheeks, such warmth I never wanted it to go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m relieved to hear that answer from you. I told you I wanted you to be in for a surprise every single day for the seven days, and today&#39;s mission is accomplished.&amp;quot; He looked at me with a smile full of love. His smile at this moment imprinted inside my mind seemed never to dissipate. &amp;quot;This park will raise all the hot air balloons and light up all the lights every night at eight o&#39;clock, and that&#39;s the surprise I want to show you today.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listened to every syllable emphasized in his voice, then I suddenly sat up from my seat, hugged his chest, and then kissed his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop saying that, such a moving surprise to me makes my heart unable to bear it.&amp;quot; I kissed him hard, but was greeted with an even stronger response from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He responded to me very forcefully with his warm tongue, and at the top of this Ferris wheel, our love seemed to be fixed here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were in this sightseeing car that belonged only to the two of us, and I leaned on his chest as he began to tell me some interesting things about other packs that I didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The time seemed to get long and long, and I wished it would become eternal, but as sleepiness crept into my eyes, I knew the day&#39;s surprise was almost over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, it&#39;s late, for your health and pup&#39;s health, it&#39;s time for us to go back to the hotel and rest.&amp;quot; Isaac looked at the sightseeing car that had reappeared at the bottom, then he stood up. &amp;quot;I&#39;m ready for a new surprise for you tomorrow.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it.&amp;quot; A smile crossed my face and then I followed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But, before I leave, I want a lollipop from over there.&amp;quot; I had some shyness at this time and lowered my head, because there were only kids in line to buy lollipops, but I suddenly wanted it very much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isn&#39;t that one for kids?&amp;quot; Isaac suddenly laughed, then he shook his head, his face still doting. &amp;quot;Oh, what a long line, I think you need to wait for me for a while.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his voice, I saw his tall figure in line behind the small children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What&#39;s this adult doing? Does he want a lollipop too?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I heard my mother say that such adults are strange.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Leave him alone, my dad is nearby. If he bullies us, my dad will teach him a lesson!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The children began to talk, his tall body looked very conspicuous in the middle of the children, the scene looked a little comical, but to me, it made me feel very warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but smile. I looked away from Isaac. This time I heard a slight footstep from behind me. These footsteps made me feel some danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I subconsciously wanted to turn my head and get his thoughts, but the next moment I felt the footsteps behind me suddenly accelerated, and then my nasal cavity was full of the smell of drugs. I did not even have time to call for help, my vision became blurred and quickly lost consciousness.</p>
