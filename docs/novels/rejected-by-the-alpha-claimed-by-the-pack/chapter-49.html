                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Neil said this, I could clearly see the ridicule on his face. Isaac&#39;s eyes became sharper. Someone was provoking his position. This was not a problem for Alpha or Beta. Neil wanted Isaac to submit to him in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I refuse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said you would help me manage pack, and this position is the most suitable for you.&#34; Neil&#39;s tone was very naive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are a lot of commanders in the pack that are suitable for Beta&#39;s position.&#34; I removed Neil&#39;s hand from my shoulder. &#34;And, did you forget that I am part of the vanguard? You gave me this position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The expression on Neil&#39;s face could not hold back. He whispered in my ear, &#34;This is what everyone wants to see. And I am your Alpha. You must listen to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or what? What do you want?&#34; I leaned close to Neil. &#34;I warn you, I let you be Alpha because I don&#39;t care about this at all. But next time you want to provoke me, you have to think clearly that you are not qualified to command me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil stood alone in the same place awkwardly. People were discussing what had just happened. Obviously, they did not take Neil seriously. Neil cleared his throat and said, &#34;Let the party continue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac walked over and whispered into my ear, &#34;I&#39;m going to get some fresh air.&#34; Before I could say anything, he went to the balcony. I knew that he would not be angered by what Neil said, but Nicole could feel that his wolf had been anxious and uneasy. Let him be quiet for a while first. I will talk to him about this after the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean pulled Toby away to talk about the negotiation between the two packs. I was attracted by the crowd in the distance. It turned out to be Fiona. She missed Neil&#39;s speech, but in terms of the embarrassment of this speech, she came at a good time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dressed like a big pink cake. Fiona&#39;s skirt was very gorgeous and complicated. The pink lace wrapped her up layer by layer. It seemed that she was ready to let Neil announce that she was Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil must have seen her. Everyone present saw her, but Neil ignored her like air and walked towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not avoid Neil because I believed that he would not dare to sneak attack me at his coronation ceremony. He walked up to me and said, &#34;You are so beautiful today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tone was absolutely not friendly. &#34;What are you doing? Kidnapper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t say that. I never thought of hurting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you just use me as bait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry about that. I just want to get my things back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to refute him or hear him say anything more, but he kept blocking me. &#34;What do you want?&#34; I raised my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you willing to be my Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are ridiculous.&#34; I turned to leave, but Neil held my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m telling the truth. I never wanted anyone else to be my Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to be your Luna.&#34; &#34;I shook his hand off.&#34; Fiona had been looking at you. Obviously, you should go to her. &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have never liked Fiona. You know. I saved you from her two years ago. Do you remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two years ago? I treated you as a friend, but what about you? You kidnapped my mate and threatened him!&#34; If he hadn&#39;t mentioned things of two years ago, I might not have been so angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil was about to speak when he suddenly sniffed in the air. &#34;You were marked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Isaac marked me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter. I don&#39;t care. You can still be my Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was really crazy. &#34;I said, no!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Toby stood in front of me. Just then, Fiona dragged her heavy dress and slowly moved over. She quarreled with Neil in a low voice, and Neil pulled her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing.&#34; I don&#39;t want others to know that Neil proposed to me. This is ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby looked at Fiona&#39;s back and said, &#34;She really looks like a big pink cake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well. Since you are alone now, miss.&#34; Toby reached out to me. &#34;Can I invite you to dance?&#34; He had a smile on his face that I could not refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; I handed him my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have been preparing for this party since a few days ago. This is the most important day in my life. I will soon become pack&#39;s Luna. I will be the queen of everyone. I will get rid of those who disrespect me. For example, that Isaac who humiliated me everywhere, and that damn witch. I will dig out her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I walked into the auditorium wearing the dress I designed myself, everyone was looking at me. This made me very satisfied. I was the most dazzling in the crowd. But when I walked into Neil, he said to the witch that he wanted the witch to be Luna. Damn it! Was he playing with me? I wanted to argue with him, but Neil dragged me all the way to the logistics room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; I pulled my arm out of Neil&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil looked around and there was no one around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rubbed my arm and said to Neil, &#34;Are you crazy? You promised me that I can be Luna!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Alpha now. I have the final say on who will be my Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you went back on your word. You want that witch to be your Luna? Aren&#39;t you afraid that I will tell others that you kidnapped Claudia and threatened Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell them then!&#34; Neil became even angrier. &#34;I will cut off your tongue. How about I cut it off right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it! This liar! I covered my mouth and said to him, &#34;Do you think you can steal Isaac&#39;s mate? He will kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I have my own way. I don&#39;t need your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just have to keep your mouth shut.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got home, I tore the dress into pieces. It was all the witch&#39;s fault for seducing men everywhere! As long as she could disappear, I was still pack&#39;s Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Late at night, I was awakened by a shudder in my dream. Isaac lay on me, his eyes turning crimson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caesar?&#34; I tried to call out the wolf&#39;s name. He bit my neck, and I could feel his canine teeth against my blood vessels. Nicole immediately felt a sense of crisis. She controlled my body and kicked Isaac in the stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nicole! He didn&#39;t want to hurt you.&#34; I tried to take back control of my body, but Nicole was still frightened. This could not be blamed on her. Caesar kept letting out a terrible roar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I comforted Nicole and asked her to give control to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac let out a heavy breath. His eyes kept changing between gold and red. I slowly walked over and hugged him. &#34;Caesar, relax. You scared Nicole.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s tensed muscles finally relaxed, and his eyes returned to golden brown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to Caesar?&#34; I wiped the sweat off Isaac&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has been very restless lately. I didn&#39;t expect him to come out and attack me while I was asleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel it. Do you know why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pulled me to the balcony. He looked at the sky. &#34;It&#39;s almost a full moon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The full moon will affect us, but how can you let your wolf go out of control?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have been having the same nightmare these days, or not a dream, but my memory. About a year ago, when I led the team to gather information outside, my team was completely destroyed, and I was bitten in the neck by a pack Alpha. I thought I was going to die, but I didn&#39;t. When I woke up, I was holding the head of that Alpha in my hand. They were all dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never said this to me, and now I finally knew why he had such a horrible aura. It turned out that he had experienced this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac continued, &#34;This is what I dreamed about. I killed everyone uncontrollably.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to guess if I am one of &#39;everyone&#39;, but I wanted to relieve his pain. I held his arm. &#34;That was just a dream. Let&#39;s go see pack&#39;s doctor tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was afraid that I would hurt you, just like what happened just now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t hurt me.&#34; I showed him my neck. &#34;I believe in you and Caesar. I will always be with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; Isaac kissed my lips lightly.</p>
