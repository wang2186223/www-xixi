                <p>&amp;quot;This child is definitely not an ordinary child, I have never made such a prophecy before, it is as if there is a mysterious power in this child that is hindering my prophecy!&amp;quot; The wizard excitedly stroked the crystal, he lowered his head, as if he put all his attention on the picture of the crystal ball.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So what is the result of the prophecy?&amp;quot; I looked at his face and my heart felt as if it was about to pop out of my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I thought before that our child would be more gifted than the average person, I didn&#39;t expect such an amazing result.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can&#39;t clearly say what his future will be, but I can feel that his future is too extraordinary for me to reach that level of attainment in wizardry.&amp;quot; The wizard&#39;s tone became a little heavier at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I can only tell you that this is a boy who has multiple powers in him and has a talent far beyond the average werewolf, but I have no way of seeing exactly what it is.&amp;quot; The wizard stroked the surface of the crystal ball.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s as if a mist is holding me back.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;With multiple powers?&amp;quot; Isaac and I looked at each other, and we were both able to understand what the other had in mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This child had the bloodline of a werewolf and a witch. Such a result did not surprise us, but the talent far beyond the average werewolf made us feel a little surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Thank you very much, Mr. Wizard.&amp;quot; Isaac looked at the wizard at this time, with sincerity in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;We are satisfied to get such a result; may I ask how much we need to pay for this prophecy?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, wait a minute!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the wizard saw that we were ready to pay and leave, he actually stood up from his chair in excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Such a prophecy almost touches on a field of wizardry that I have never touched before, and I wish to know this child better.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot; Knowing more?&amp;quot; Isaac and I paused with some confusion, waiting for his next words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This beautiful lady, I just have too much love for wizardry, and I swear my understanding will not have any ill effects on your child. I have a crystal ball here. If you place your hand on it, you can contact me and I can make some prophecies through it.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wizard said as he pulled out a small crystal ball from a drawer under his desk, it looked like it could be held perfectly in one hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I am really very curious about this child&#39;s abilities, and I sincerely hope that you will let me prophesy about him on a regular basis, and that you can contact me through the crystal ball at any time, and I will be happy to help in any way that I can.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood frozen in place as I heard his words. I never expected this wizard to say such a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The prophecy was very energy-consuming. Was he really just curious and wanted to know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had some doubts, but I saw his eyes at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he stood up from the chair, because of the height, I finally saw his eyes, his eyes full of sincerity, his pupils white as if like a light, without any dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>White pupils? This was definitely rarer than my green pupils. Perhaps it was these eyes that were too easy to draw attention to, so he used the cloak to cover his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him seriously, and to my surprise, I didn&#39;t hear any of his inner thoughts through his eyes, as if he wasn&#39;t thinking anything inside, he clearly wasn&#39;t using any magic. Was my mind reading not working?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my head and locked eyes with someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Just how extraordinary is her child to make a wizard so excited and curious.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;She&#39;s so beautiful and her husband is so handsome!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed my mind-reading hadn&#39;t failed, but why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a powerful wizard, so maybe there was some specialness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no way to know the reason inside, but I trusted my own judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because I was equally interested in his special pupils, and at the same time, I wanted to know why I couldn&#39;t read his mind. He looked at me with such an expectant gaze that all my attention was on his white pupil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was silent for two seconds at this time, and then I placed that crystal ball in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just an ordinary crystal ball. I didn&#39;t feel any traces of magic formation; I couldn&#39;t see anything at all from the appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be on the safe side, I still used a simple spell check spell. If there was a hidden spell in this crystal ball, then the crystal ball would turn red. If not, the crystal ball would not change at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recited the spell silently, and the crystal ball did not change in any way. I looked up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Mr. Wizard, I have great respect for your pursuit of wizardry research.&amp;quot; I had a smile on my face at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Thank you very much for the prophecy. I agree with your request.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This prophecy ended in a pleasant conversation, and after paying the wizard, we left the store with the crystal ball.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, why did you believe the wizard so easily?&amp;quot; In the pumpkin wagon, Isaac let me lean on his shoulder, his voice with some doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I didn&#39;t sense any malice, and, I was just as curious about him.&amp;quot; My voice became a little more serious at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I have never seen white pupils in a witch or wizard. And, he didn&#39;t use any sorcery to block my gift, but I couldn&#39;t read his mind.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I think I need to investigate this wizard.&amp;quot; At this point the expression on Isaac&#39;s face became serious, and the determination inside his eyes was the most reassuring presence I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;During this time of your pregnancy, I will use my best to protect you, and I will not put you in danger again. Isaac held me tighter as he wrapped his arms around my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Whether or not Whit Pack&#39;s beta is telling the truth, I will stay by your side for the rest of my life, and no one will be able to hurt you as long as I&#39;m around.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smelled the scent of ebony and cedar on him and leaned against his powerful body, being in his warm embrace would always make me feel like I was drunk, it was as if he was my warmest harbor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at his strong arms, and my past experiences made it clear to me that no one was going to be around anyone all the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pregnancy had left me with no way to transform into a wolf, and I had no doubt that Isaac would do his best to protect me, but there would always be times when he wasn&#39;t there for me, so I had to make myself stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to make my sorcery stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked down and stroked my belly, my baby, I would protect you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dazzling sun shone through the window on the pumpkin wagon on Isaac and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at the window, it was a particularly nice day, which gradually improved my mood, which was bad because of the previous accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, we&#39;ll soon be at our next destination.&amp;quot; Isaac&#39;s voice rang in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;After the sea of flowers is paradise, so what is after paradise? Please look forward to it. I&#39;m going to make you feel all the wonderful things you can imagine in these seven days.&amp;quot;</p>
