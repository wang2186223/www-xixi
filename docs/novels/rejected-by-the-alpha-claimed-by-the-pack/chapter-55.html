                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby&#39;s eyes turned black. He let Akio take over his body. Black hair grew on his body, and Toby also turned into a wolf. Caesar growled at Akio. We could all feel the terrifying aura coming from his body. This was the pressure from a superior. Akio&#39;s claws dug deep into the soil to force himself not to tremble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the red eyes and tried to enter his mind. But a powerful spiritual force interfered with me, and my head felt a sharp pain. Countless images flashed in front of my eyes, and my ears were filled with sharp sounds. Isaac&#39;s current spiritual world was full of darkness and screams. I felt like I had entered a crazy amusement park. Anger and pain were transmitted into my mind through his spirit. Because I received too much in an instant, I immediately retched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caesar flew towards Akio. Akio jumped to the right to avoid him, but Caesar&#39;s claws still left a wound on his body. Akio&#39;s blood made Caesar even more excited. Caesar used a fake move to deceive Akio. He used his own weight to press down on Akio. Akio struggled under him. He wanted to bite Akio&#39;s neck, but Akio used all his strength to push him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akio escaped Caesar&#39;s suppression, but a large piece of flesh was torn off his neck. His carotid artery was torn apart, and blood kept gushing out from it. His self-healing ability was not so strong, and Caesar approached him step by step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued to try to control Caesar, but his powerful spiritual force kept refusing me. Akio&#39;s neck was still bleeding, and Caesar&#39;s claws were right above his head. No! I couldn&#39;t let him kill Toby! I immediately transformed and stood in front of Akio. Caesar&#39;s claws patted my back, and I felt like my internal organs were about to be shaken out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Akio took advantage of this moment to bite Caesar&#39;s leg. Caesar howled in pain. He knocked Akio to the side, and I could hear the sound of bones breaking. Akio fainted. Caesar stared at me with red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My white fur was dyed red with blood. I looked into his eyes. If I did not succeed this time, I would definitely die here. After so much suffering, I finally had my own mate and status. Things should not end like this. I would not allow it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I broke into Isaac&#39;s spiritual world again. My head was about to crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caesar! I order you to stop!&#34; Caesar hesitated. I could feel the blood flowing from my nose, but it was not enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held the ruby ring in my hand. It could strengthen the witch&#39;s ability. &#34;Stop!&#34; I gathered all my mental strength and issued an order. The ring shattered in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caesar stood still and howled in pain. He used his head to hit the ground. I stopped my command and he stumbled toward me. His red eyes slowly returned to normal. I lost all my strength because of this order. My vision turned black and I fell to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like countless gunfire was fired at my head. In front of me was a chaotic red and white. I heard the sound of the wind in the woods, the sound of insects drilling out of the ground, and vague screams. I could not control myself or Caesar at all. I did not know what we were doing. I could only feel the red moon calling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then there was a voice in the distance that told me to stop. I liked that voice very much. It could make all the screams stop. I continued to search for this voice, and then I heard a clear voice. It was Claudia! I suddenly remembered everything. I came to save her. But my body could not move at all. That voice tightly bound me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the sound disappeared, I saw the scene in front of me. Claudia&#39;s green eyes were shining, and golden light flashed on her irises. Then she fell to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly held her in my arms. Her body temperature was very low, and her face was pale. I felt her pulse, and her heart was beating slowly. I had to quickly send her to pack&#39;s doctor. When I left with her in my arms, I saw the miserable state of rouge&#39;s camp. My nightmare reappeared. There were corpses everywhere under the red moonlight. I also found the living Toby in the corpses. I guessed that the most serious injury on his body was caused by me losing control. He was also in a bad state. I carried him on my back and hugged Claudia with the other hand. I hoped that I could send them to the hospital in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked a little scary. The nurses in the hospital screamed when they saw me. The doctor asked them to calm down and send the two people into the emergency room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, the doctor came out of the emergency room. He told me that Claudia&#39;s body temperature was close to low temperature. Panic filled my heart and the feeling of hatred returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor saw my abnormality and quickly said to me, &#34;Alpha, don&#39;t be nervous. There are no wounds on Luna&#39;s body. Her mental strength has been injured. She needs mate&#39;s strength now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to calm down. &#34;I got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor drove everyone out. I sat by Claudia&#39;s bed and tried to connect to my mate. But just as the doctor said, she was injured. Her brain created a barrier for everything. I held her hand, hoping to give her some support. Through mate&#39;s connection, I let my thoughts seep into her brain bit by bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this obviously triggered her defense mechanism. I never knew that her mental strength was so strong. She hit me out at once, and my head felt a sharp pain. I touched my nose. Sure enough, there was bright red blood flowing down. I was punished for my earlier offense, but Claudia still showed no signs of waking up. I could only endure the headache and continue to try to repair her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t remember how many times I was kicked out by Claudia. I wrapped her with my smell and gently touched the mark I gave her with my hand. She finally calmed down. I could feel the change in her aura. This change happened last night. Her eyes flashed with golden light. You couldn&#39;t resist those eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When dawn broke, Claudia&#39;s temperature returned to normal. She opened her eyes and looked at me. I couldn&#39;t say a word and could only hug her tightly. Claudia said to me in an extremely weak voice, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned to the snow again. I walked alone in the snow. There was a soft white light in front of my eyes. My intuition told me that the white light must be very warm. I ran towards the white light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the snowstorm blocked my path. This time, the snowstorm was even bigger than before. I searched everywhere for the wolf that accompanied me last time, but he was missing this time. I wanted to call his name, but the name was right in front of my mouth. I couldn&#39;t call it no matter what. I walked with difficulty in the wind and snow. A black beast approached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to avoid the beast, but he kept chasing me. I could only run in the opposite direction of the white light. I picked up a stone from the ground and smashed it hard at the beast. Only then did he run away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time I approached the white light, the beast would come out to make trouble. Every time I would use the stone to drive him away. Where are you? I missed the big grey-black wolf. I wanted to bury my face in his warm fur. I almost cried because of this. Then the snowstorm slowly stopped. I smelled a snow pine in the wind. This smell made me no longer afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I walked into the white light again, the beast pounced in front of me. He did not hurt me. I wanted to go around him and continue walking. But he bit my clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it was you.&#34; I touched the beast&#39;s fur and he changed back to his original appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you want me to go there?&#34; I pointed to the white light not far away. The gray wolf pulled my clothes and was about to pull me back. I was not as strong as him and could only follow him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I opened my eyes, I saw Isaac&#39;s worried face. He hugged me, and his warm body temperature made me feel like I was back in the real world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac put me back on the bed. I was in a hurry to ask him, &#34;How is Toby?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is still in a coma because of excessive blood loss. He has blood in the ward next to yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brain was working normally. What happened tonight was all because of Fiona. I asked Isaac, &#34;Has the news that I was hospitalized been spread?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I sent you here in the middle of the night. The sun just rose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That Fiona should not have gone far. I will not let her go this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac immediately understood what I meant. &#34;I know, I will catch her back. You should rest well now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened last night? I don&#39;t remember.&#34; Isaac asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You lost control, worse than that night. I can only control your mind. This is the first time I have succeeded. But it consumes too much of my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; Isaac&#39;s eyes were full of guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to apologize to me. I know it is not you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is bad. My nightmare is real.&#34; Isaac covered his face with his hands. &#34;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with me. I can&#39;t control myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter. I can control you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you can&#39;t faint every time because you control me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t tell him that I could. I had a breakthrough in my abilities last night. Miranda once told me that my ability to read minds was not just a simple one. Under certain circumstances, I could control people&#39;s minds. She just helped me open my talent. My real ability still needs me to train myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what really worried me was Isaac. He was usually a very rational person. I didn&#39;t know why he suddenly went crazy last night, but it was too strange last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you still remember the moon last night?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember the red full moon. But I have experienced a Blood moon before. I have never gone crazy like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you haven&#39;t awakened before. Do you still remember what Richard said?&#34; I searched the books I have checked in my mind. &#34;That&#39;s right, I know why you went crazy.&#34;</p>
