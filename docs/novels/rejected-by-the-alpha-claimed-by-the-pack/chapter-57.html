                <p>Leaving the pack always reminded me of the past. My team and I fought with all kinds of people in this kind of place to survive. Now I am a pack Alpha, but the impact this place gave me didn&#39;t change. Fiona thought that she would be safe if she didn&#39;t tell me the name of that medicine dealer. But in those two years, I had already learned everything about the black market.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took her to meet the medicine dealer. When he saw me, he turned and ran, but my men had already stood behind him and blocked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you running?&#34; I asked the drug dealer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He directly knelt on the ground. &#34;I&#39;m sorry! Alpha, I don&#39;t know who Fiona&#39;s medicine is for. Otherwise, how could I sell it to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know who I am?&#34; He called me Alpha, but I had only been Alpha for a short time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone in the black market knows! The recent news about you, everybody knew it two days ago.&#34; The medicine dealer&#39;s tone was very exaggerated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Know about what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About you killing all the rouge groups in the east alone!&#34; He swallowed his saliva and continued, &#34;The boss of that group of rouges is a real monster. I heard that he can crush people&#39;s skulls with his bare hands. But he has been killed by you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you also know who the medicine is for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know! I could swear to Moon Goddess. After the news spread, I knew that Luna was a witch. I was always worried that you would come.&#34; The medicine dealer glared at Fiona when he said this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not here to punish you. I need you to do something for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure! As long as I can do it!&#34; The drug dealer lowered his head and touched the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed Fiona, who was tied up, in front of him. &#34;Your friend likes to be with rouge very much. Do you understand what I mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand! I will find the most&#34; suitable &#34;rouge group for her.&#34; As he spoke, he kicked Fiona hard. Fiona made a muffled sound with cloth in her mouth .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And, send her away. I don&#39;t want to see her face again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise you with my life that you will never see her again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, and the medicine against witches...&#34; I looked at him meanfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I threw it away long ago!&#34; The medicine dealer&#39;s sweat flowed down his face. &#34;No one in the black market would dare to produce this medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have saved your life. Be grateful to fate.&#34; When I left, I heard the sound of medicine dealer collapsed on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac has been busy with something I don&#39;t know recently. I don&#39;t want to read his mind. I promised him that I would trust him forever. But he was always absent-minded when facing me. I don&#39;t know what happened between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to know so much, just ask him directly.&#34; Toby was impatient with me for the first time. Perhaps it was because I had been complaining to him, or simply because he didn&#39;t want to hear about Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if he has been working all the time? I don&#39;t want him to think I am a suspicious person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are now.&#34; Toby&#39;s eyes never left the dessert in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean it. He has been a little cold to me recently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Although I hate him very much, I don&#39;t think he will be disloyal to you. He never looks at others with any emotions, except you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; I didn&#39;t pay much attention to the look in Isaac&#39;s eyes when he looked at others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t notice? He looked at us like he was looking at a potato.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby&#39;s description made me laugh. &#34;You are the most handsome one among the potatoes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby rolled his eyes. &#34;Why should I try to comfort you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t doubt his loyalty. He has been very strange to me recently. I want to know the reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to know what he&#39;s doing, follow him.&#34; Toby chewed the cake in his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea.&#34; I actually thought about it, but it&#39;s not very good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re bothering me here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, you aren&#39;t doing anything serious even if I am not here.&#34; I pointed to the desserts in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, but don&#39;t let me follow Isaac with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please.&#34; I put my hands together and looked at him pitifully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t follow a Alpha unless I am crazy. He will find out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have an idea. Help me. I will buy all your afternoon tea in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, okay, just once. This is not for the afternoon tea. I just hope you can be at ease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I gave Toby a grateful hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby and I used a drug to cover up the smell, hoping that it could deceive Caesar&#39;s nose. Isaac was going out before I woke up. He left a kiss on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hugged his waist and refused to let him leave. &#34;Stay with me for a while longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I can&#39;t do it now. I&#39;ll come back to accompany you tonight.&#34; Isaac pulled my hand away and left the house. He was different from before. I rarely acted like a spoiled child to him. Now he didn&#39;t care about me at all. The sense of loss in my heart slowly spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He went out.&#34; I contacted Toby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I&#39;m staring at him now!&#34; It was Toby&#39;s voice on the other side of the earphone. &#34;Jesus, why did I promise you to do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you are curious too. Well, keep staring. I&#39;ll come to you immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had been staying in the office this morning, and many acquaintances entered his office. Some of them stayed for a while before leaving, and there were also the commanders who were dissatisfied with Isaac. They were still cursing when they came out of Isaac&#39;s office. But I really wanted to tell them that Isaac could hear them from the other side of the door, but he didn&#39;t fuss over it. Isaac was really busy, and I felt a little disgusted with my behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said to Toby when it was almost noon, &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally, I&#39;m going to be moldy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we were about to leave, Toby stopped me. Isaac came out of the office. He didn&#39;t take anyone with him. Toby signaled me to follow him, but I had already planned to go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve already followed him here. Let&#39;s continue.&#34; Toby stared at Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes I wonder if you like Isaac.&#34; I teased him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t disgust me. Where do you think he is sneaking off to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t sneak around, and why did he tell me about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, this is the loophole. He wants to go to a place you don&#39;t know.&#34; Toby lowered his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I was persuaded by Toby&#39;s deliberately mystifying tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We followed Isaac to a beautiful greenhouse. As soon as Isaac entered, a girl came out to greet him. The girl looked like the owner of the greenhouse. She chatted with Isaac, and Isaac revealed a happy expression. I suddenly panicked. I had never heard that Isaac had such a friend. He rarely relaxed in front of outsiders, and he even had a good-looking smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sure that my expression was terrible. Toby looked at me and said, &#34;This doesn&#39;t mean anything. Maybe Isaac is going to buy you flowers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say a word and continued to look at Isaac and the girl. The girl looked about the same age as us. Although she was not beautiful, she was cute. And a girl who ran a greenhouse should be able to attract a lot of attention. Isaac and her walked into the greenhouse and looked at each other. The girl seemed to be introducing all kinds of flowers to him. After a while, they stopped. The girl smiled and said something to Isaac. Isaac is actually a little shy. I have rarely seen this expression of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I saw Isaac take out a small square box from his clothes. He smiled and opened the box to the girl. The diamond ring in the box emitted a dazzling light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart had sunk to the stomach. The scene of Isaac holding Fiona appeared in my mind again. I knew that it was all fake. I knew how much Isaac hated her, but everything in front of me reminded me of my bad memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I back to senses, I had already run to the road. Toby was chasing me behind. My hand was shaking. The scene just now was like a ghost chasing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby panted and pulled me. &#34;Why don&#39;t you go and ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the point? You saw it too.&#34; I didn&#39;t want to tell him how badly I had been hurt the last time I wanted to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They aren&#39;t doing anything. Isaac only showed her a ring and didn&#39;t give it to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a diamond ring!&#34; I shouted to Toby. Isaac didn&#39;t give me a diamond ring, but I didn&#39;t care about it before. We were too busy at that time, and so many things happened after that. I put the diamond ring and wedding in our future plans. But now, he doesn&#39;t intend to give me this ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby understood what I meant. &#34;I&#39;ll send you home first. It&#39;s better for you to ask him about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been waiting at home for Isaac to come back. My mind was in a mess. The scene of him chatting with the girl, the way they smiled, and the diamond ring. They always appeared in front of me. I couldn&#39;t control myself from thinking about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac saw me sitting on the bed, hugging my knees. He sat beside me. &#34;Sorry, I wanted to come back earlier today, but there were too many things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have the fragrance of flowers,&#34; I said calmly to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac began to stammer, &#34;Is there? This... is the flower they sent to my office... used for decoration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him in disbelief. He really would lie to me. &#34;You bastard!&#34; I pushed him away and rushed out of the house.</p>
