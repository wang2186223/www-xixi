                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that my mother had been under house arrest by Andre, but I never thought that he would dare to threaten me with my mother&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to kill your Luna? Your people will despise you because of this.&#34; I had never heard of any Alpha who would kill his Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I lose the war, they will despise me! If you sneak attack, I will let her go.&#34; His claws slowly extended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted me to die. All of the pack&#39;s warriors had been defeated by the White Claw pack, not to mention that I only brought a small team to sneak attack. Taking a step back, even if I kill the White Claw pack&#39;s Alpha, he could directly betray me. There was no need to fight. He just needed to give me to the White Claw pack. This was a plan that had not failed for him. He saw that I was silent and penetrated my mother&#39;s skin with his claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood slowly oozed out of my mother&#39;s neck. I absolutely would break Andre&#39;s hand. &#34;Stop! I promise you, you let go of my mother first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t think that I don&#39;t know what you are thinking.&#34; After Andre stopped, he still held my mother in front of him. He licked the blood on my mother&#39;s neck with his tongue. &#34;As long as I let her go, you will rush up and kill me.&#34; He thought of me too darkly. In fact, I just wanted to let him be disabled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you can kill the White Claw pack&#39;s Alpha, I will let her go.&#34; The premise was that I could come back alive, and I could read his subtext.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother looked at me with tears in her eyes. Her sealed mouth was crying. I didn&#39;t know what she was going to say to me, but I didn&#39;t expect her to show such an expression to me. Perhaps she also thought that I was on my way to death. I smiled at my mother. &#34;Okay, I will kill their Alpha. You&#39;d better keep your promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre laughed loudly. He could finally solve his heart disease. &#34;I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t intend to bring anyone to die with me. At dawn, I sneaked into the edge of the White Claw pack alone. Their guards were very good. I used Caesar&#39;s keen sense of smell to avoid those traps and patrol soldiers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hid behind a bush. As long as I bypassed the barbed wire in front of me, I could sneak into their pack. After this, things were much simpler. As long as I could find a one-on-one occasion with the Alpha, I was confident to kill him. But I smelled someone approaching me. I lay on the ground and waited for him to come over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other party was also approaching carefully. Did someone discover me? I was already very cautious. It seemed that there was going to be a change in the plan. I held my breath and focused all my attention on the wolf&#39;s senses. Just as the other party&#39;s hand reached out to the bushes, I covered his mouth and locked his two hands behind his back. Then I used my weight to press him to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tied him up, thinking that it was better to stun him or kill him directly. The other party began to struggle violently. I was very curious that he could find my trace. Then I saw the other party through the faint light in the distance. It was a face that I absolutely did not want to see now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia gave me a list of things she wanted me to go back to the White Claw pack to retrieve what she needed. I highly doubted that she was just trying to send me away. After that confession, she came to see me alone. She rejected me in the most polite terms. I was sad, but she still didn&#39;t like anyone. This proved that I still had a chance. I was not someone who would give up easily, and one day I would make her fall in love with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was about to reach our pack, I felt that there was someone I was very familiar with nearby. It was the call of the wolf blood. I followed this feeling, but I felt more and more wrong because I felt a familiar aura. It was an aura that I had never felt from anyone else. It was a hair-raising aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly approached the strange bush, but before I could react, a hand covered my mouth and pressed me to the ground with a huge force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is it you?&#34; Isaac was very surprised when he saw my face. I wanted to ask him what he was doing here secretly. But my mouth was blocked, so I could only use my eyes to protest him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked at me and fell silent. I swore that his expression was thinking about where to dump my corpse after killing me. The closer I got to Isaac, the more I could feel the familiar blood in his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell him.&#34; My wolf talked to me in my mind. &#34;You are related by blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why can&#39;t he feel it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because he has never established a spiritual link with us.&#34; &#34;Indeed, this is our family tradition. Werewolves with the same blood as us could establish a spiritual link with our wolves. I tried to shout to Isaac in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; Isaac looked at me, but he realized that I did not open my mouth at all. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words in my mind did not pass because he was still in a closed state. I could only struggle and signal him to untie the strip of cloth tied to my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac warned me, &#34;I will let go of you. If you want to scream or run away, I will cut your throat before you speak.&#34; He gestured his claws in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded helplessly. He finally let go of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can you speak in my mind?&#34; Isaac asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s called Spiritual Link. It&#39;s a unique skill of our family.&#34; I could only continue, &#34;I don&#39;t know why you have our family&#39;s blood, but it proves that you are not Alpha Andre&#39;s child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac glared at me as if I had exposed his biggest secret, but he still cared more about his identity, so he couldn&#39;t wait to ask me about our family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, I had already guessed it. I told him that we were the only family who had the blood. The only werewolves who could establish a link were my father and my siblings. But my father was with my mother as soon as he became an adult. He couldn&#39;t have other children. Most likely, before my father became Alpha, the White Claw pack&#39;s Alpha was my father&#39;s cousin. He could also establish a link with us. But in the war that almost wiped us out, the previous Alpha died on the battlefield in order to protect us. But he didn&#39;t leave a child before he died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After listening to my statement, Isaac fell into deep thought. He seemed to be in a hurry to go back, and I immediately pulled him back. &#34;What are you doing secretly beside our pack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s none of your business. Also, you better not tell anyone about what happened today, including Claudia.&#34; He didn&#39;t tell me why he came to our pack, but I felt that I had saved many lives just now.</p>
