                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if Isaac could see my concern. We made a deal that he could come and stay with me every night to help me through my rut. Of course, this was all to ease my physical discomfort. I had to agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Isaac literally came to stay with me every night. He would hold me to sleep all night. Just holding me, of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was supposed to be a quiet night. Isaac didn&#39;t seem to be in a good mood that day, he buried his head in my neck and sniffed me like a large pampered dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac?&#34; I whispered his name. He looked up at me just in time to look into my eyes. After a few seconds of staring at each other, I read his thoughts, &#34;I like her so much. What should I do to have her?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I covered my mouth to keep myself from screaming. Was Isaac actually into me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t he reject me as his mate? But when I read his mind, I could feel how strong Isaac&#39;s adoration was. Of all the people whose hearts I had read, Isaac was the only one who had such a warm affection for me. This strange love filled my heart with a swelling sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Isaac saw my reaction and thought I was starting to get hot again. He took my face in his hands and kissed my forehead gently. My face started to burn, this time not because of a rut, but because of Isaac&#39;s affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lifted my quilt to the side in disgust. &#34;You call this &#34;rag&#34; a quilt?&#34; He shifted to a wolf, &#34;Hold me. It&#39;ll keep you warmer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time that I saw Isaac&#39;s wolf form, and I touched his fur tenderly. Isaac&#39;s snout brushed the side of my face, &#34;Don&#39;t be afraid, I&#39;ll protect you.&#34; I slowly held him in my arms and let him lay down on the bed, stroking the fur on his back. The wolf&#39;s fur wasn&#39;t as soft as the smaller animals, but it was still very warm. I buried my face in the fur on his chest and was wrapped around by the warm furry, and I immediately fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up the next morning in the warm fur of Isaac&#39;s wolf. It turned out that everything that happened last night was not a dream and Isaac really fell in love with me. I gently brushed my hand through the fur on his chest and the sensitive wolf was woken up by me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The temperature inside wasn&#39;t as cold as it had been during the night, and Isaac transformed back into his human form. We lay on the bed in silence. He suddenly wrapped his arms around my waist to bring me closer to him, then my chest was pressed against his solid one. His strong and long legs rested on my thighs, imprisoning my entire body in his arms. Isaac ruffled the long hair that was obstructive in front of my face and looked seriously into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could read his mind. &#34;These eyes shouldn&#39;t be covered up, they&#39;re so beautiful!&#34; I was suddenly shy, and it was the first time someone had used the word &#34;beautiful&#34; to describe me. Long periods of malnutrition had made me small and my hair was dry and yellow. None of the opposite sex would even look at me. To get away from this shame, I tried to bring the conversation to Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m surprised your transformation stayed up all night. I&#39;ve never seen a werewolf with such power.&#34; I was telling the truth, transforming was very energy-intensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s normal for me.&#34; Isaac&#39;s tone held his own pride and confidence, &#34;I am the son of Alpha, the future heir to the Crimson Shadow pack.&#34; His eyes seemed to light up as he said that. I looked at him and my heart softened, and the corners of my mouth turned up uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the next few days, I seemed to be living a beautiful dream. Isaac still teased me during the day when someone was watching. But with him there, no one else dared to bully me. It was enough for me to know that the reason behind his pranks was not out of hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every night I got a fever and Isaac would sneak in to see me. One day he brought a beautifully wrapped cupcake that was customized by the sweet shop and had a little bear on it. He watched me eat half of it and then kissed the cream off my lips. Recently, Isaac had always brought me exquisite treats that I hadn&#39;t eaten before, or trinkets that I hadn&#39;t seen before. That was fun, but what made me happiest was that he would hold me in his arms all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe our relationship would never be under the sun, but the happiness of the past few days made me intoxicated. I felt Isaac&#39;s firm arms and how I wished I could stay in this warm embrace forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight I slipped into Claudia&#39;s room as usual, and she lay quietly and dutifully like a deer on her bed waiting for me. I brought her a fruit tonight, which was a gift from the other wolves to my father. The fruit was plump and red with an inviting aroma that immediately reminded me of Claudia, who always smelled faintly of flowers and fruits and whose scent immediately calmed me down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia had never seen fruit like this before and she looked like she had discovered a new world. I put the fruit into her mouth and she took a bite. The fruit&#39;s bright red juice dripped down her lips and onto her chin. What a sloppy girl! I moved closer to her and licked the juice off her chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know if it was the fruit or what, but the sweet taste blossomed on my tongue. Unable to control my feelings, I followed her chin and kissed her on the lips. Claudia didn&#39;t resist and I deepened the kiss. I was excited, and my teeth were gently bumping up against hers as our tongues intertwined together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was at that point that I felt my body begin to burn unconsciously. It should have been Claudia that brought my rut forward. To relieve the heat in my body, I wanted to touch Claudia&#39;s skin as much as possible. I pinned her to the bed and made her put her arms around my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could cradle her soft body with one hand. Her thin legs trembled and I couldn&#39;t resist touching them. The delicate feeling of touch made me don&#39;t want to leave. I kissed her collarbone and the large area of skin below her neck. It wasn&#39;t enough and I wanted more. And, Claudia was already going weak at the knees because of my kisses, looking defenseless.</p>
