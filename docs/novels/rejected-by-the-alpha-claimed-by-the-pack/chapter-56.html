                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an ancient bloodline among the werewolves. They were werewolves from different continents. They had unparalleled strength and agility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, this bloodline was almost extinct. It was recorded in history that their connection with the moon was stronger. Every time the Blood moon appeared, they would be stimulated to their strongest power, and at the same time, they would have a thirst for blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore, these werewolves would fight each other until the strongest one survived. The stronger the survived werewolf of the bloodline were, the easier it was to be influenced by Blood moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a blessing from Moon Goddess, and also her curse. There were many werewolves who had killed their own mate and children, and because of this, they had found the witch in the legend who could control one&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The powerful witch had fallen in love with the werewolf Alpha. She was the only one who could control Alpha&#39;s madness. The witch had lost too much spiritual strength because she frequently controlled Alpha&#39;s powerful mind, and almost died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha painfully marked the witch, but the witch woke up because of this. So they established the connection of mate, and this bloodline retained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I read this book when I was in coven. I thought it was a fairy tale, because the Alpha and the witch in it were very similar to Isaac and me. I didn&#39;t expect it to really exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After listening to my words, Isaac was silent for a while and said to me, &amp;quot;Thank you, Moon Goddess. The mate bond saved us.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, he was the one who pulled me back from the edge of death. When I woke up from the dream, I realized how horrible the white light was. Death always lured me warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse entered my room and said, &amp;quot;The patient next door is awake. Do you want to go and see him?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to get up, but Isaac pressed me back to the bed. &amp;quot;You should have a good rest here.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I am fine.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Listen to your voice,&amp;quot; Isaac said to me. My voice sounded a little weak. He touched my hair and said, &amp;quot;I will go to see him.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Be nice to him. He is a patient.&amp;quot; I was afraid they would quarrel in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I think he is fine with his self-healing ability.&amp;quot; Isaac was right. I always thought of Toby as the younger brother who needed my protection. But he also had Alpha&#39;s blood. He was much stronger than other werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, while we were talking, Toby came to my ward. The nurse called him behind him. &amp;quot;You can&#39;t run around now.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby turned back and said to her with a smile, &amp;quot;I won&#39;t run around. I&#39;ll just sit here.&amp;quot; He sat on the other side of my bed. The nurse was moved by his smile, and her face instantly turned red. Then she ran away shyly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Very charming.&amp;quot; I teased Toby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t be like this. I came to find you as soon as I woke up.&amp;quot; Toby&#39;s voice was energetic, but his face was not good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac said to him, &amp;quot;Who told you to come here? You should listen to the nurse and not run around.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I don&#39;t want to be taught a lesson by someone who seriously injured me.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whispered into Toby&#39;s ear, &amp;quot;Isaac was just shy. He was going to see you just now.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop. It&#39;s terrible.&amp;quot; Toby shrank his neck. He asked us, &amp;quot;What happened after I fainted?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told him about how I controlled Isaac. Of course, I didn&#39;t tell him the fact that I was about to die, and the legend of Alpha and the witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby looked a little disappointed. &amp;quot;Wow, this is really... fantastic.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I probably knew why he was unhappy, so I changed the topic. &amp;quot;So don&#39;t mess with me in the future. Be careful that I will brainwash you.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I have never provoked you.&amp;quot; Toby spread his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s man came in and said a few words in his ear. He nodded solemnly, and then the man bowed to me and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac said to me, &amp;quot;I caught Fiona.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really admire Isaac&#39;s ability and efficiency. His people were all elites found from various places. These people only listened to his orders. They only used a few hours to catch Fiona.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I couldn&#39;t stay in the hospital for more than a day. The scene of being hurt by Fiona always appeared in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I was a slave before, she used all kinds of excuses to bully me. When she saw my eyes, she wanted to kill me. She even almost succeeded several times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac couldn&#39;t stop me, so he followed me closely. We walked into the cold and damp interrogation room. The cell next to the cell emitted a moldy smell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We could hear Fiona cursing in the distance.&amp;quot;Let me go, you bastards! Do you know who I am?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I know who you are.&amp;quot; I went into the interrogation room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;How could it be you?&amp;quot; Fiona was shocked to see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I approached her and rolled up my sleeve, letting her look at the pinprick in my arm. &amp;quot;You want me to be tortured and die, but I am standing in front of you. How do you feel?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You bitch! Damn witch, you should be burned to death!&amp;quot; Fiona scolded me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, who was standing behind me, couldn&#39;t stand her anymore. But I stopped him. &amp;quot;Let me do it.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Kill her!&amp;quot; Nicole roared in my heart. &amp;quot;If you can&#39;t do it, let me do it!&amp;quot; Nicole hated people who challenged her status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I am pack&#39;s Luna, I am not a judge.&amp;quot; If I do what she did to me to her, she will definitely die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Be the judge then. She owes you too much. As you know, as long as I expose her crimes, pack members will execute her in a more cruel way. Of course, I will be one of them.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Kill her! Kill her!&amp;quot; Nicole screamed in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held Fiona&#39;s neck with both hands. Her face was red because of congestion. But she still looked at me with resentment, without any intention of repenting. My hands tightened more and more. I could feel Fiona&#39;s pulse violently jumping under my hands. Fiona finally began to make a sound of suffocation, and her eyes began to roll back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No! I let go. Fiona fell to the ground and gasped wildly. Her voice was like a pumping air. I couldn&#39;t just end a life like this, which made me feel very guilty. I knew she deserved it, but the feeling of killing her with my hands made me feel very uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach tightened. Isaac hugged me and he patted my back. &amp;quot;It&#39;s ok. I respect your choice.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was overwhelmed by exhaustion. I leaned against Isaac and said, &amp;quot;She disgusted me. I don&#39;t want to see her face again.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Okay, I will deal with her.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sent Claudia home to rest. She had done too much these days. I could lift her up with one hand. I didn&#39;t even know how she managed to hold on with such a thin and weak body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed her on the bed, and she leaned against my chest and fell asleep. I looked at her pale face. She was now like a fragile glass doll. I combed her long silver hair with my fingers. The soft touch made me feel at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have never been so grateful to the Goddess of the Moon for giving me such a great mate. I owe her too much. We couldn&#39;t even complete the wedding because too many things happened at that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t let go of all of the pack&#39;s work and prepare for the wedding with Claudia. When I finished dealing with Fiona&#39;s matter, I must hold the grandest wedding for Claudia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Claudia fell into deep sleep and she let out a steady breath, I left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona had gone crazy in prison. She would be whipped by my people if she scolded Claudia. Now it seemed that she had learned her lesson. When I walked into the cell, she did not make a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Alpha.&amp;quot; The guard holding the whip gestured to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she say anything else? Something about Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said a lot. Most of it was about Luna being bullied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used my whip to prop up Fiona&#39;s head. &amp;quot;How should I deal with you?&amp;quot; Of course I would kill her, but it was too easy for her. She should not die so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Please, Isaac. We have been playing together since we were young.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, I never thought you would become like this.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I knew from the beginning that rouge would not think of such a delicate plan, but I did not expect that the person behind it was you. How did you collude with rouge outside?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, I was threatened by them.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You are so smart. You know that I have killed them, so you put all the blame on the dead, and dead people won&#39;t speak.&amp;quot; I believe it was her who made the plan for Neil. &amp;quot;But you don&#39;t know that my mate is a witch who knows how to read one&#39;s mind.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Reading mind?&amp;quot; Fiona widened her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if I tell you this. You are going to die anyway.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You have a rouge friend. I remember that he sold medicine on the black market.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I asked him to contact you, as long as you can spare my life.&amp;quot; Even now she still thought that I was looking for that medicine dealer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You think I don&#39;t know what you are up to? I don&#39;t care about that medicine dealer. But since you like to be with rouge so much, I will bring you to him.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No! Please don&#39;t!&amp;quot; Fiona shook her head frantically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You see, you still know very well what will happen if you fall into the hands of rouge.&amp;quot; I pinched Fiona&#39;s neck, and my fingertips had pierced her skin. &amp;quot;You almost let Claudia experience this. I will make you repent for what you have done for the rest of your life.&amp;quot;</p>
