                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and I were squeezed on the same bed. Originally, he refused to come up because he was afraid of hurting my wound. But I was really too cold. Isaac held my cold hand and decided to take off his shirt and get into my quilt. Because the bed was not long enough, his legs could only bend slightly to hold my legs. I clung to Isaac&#39;s body and the blood in my body slowly flowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, I just heard something else.&#34; I looked up at Isaac. His chin was on top of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; When he spoke, his whole chest shook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was hesitating whether to say it or not. His father was not his biological father, and he wanted to kill him. Isaac saw my hesitation and said. &#34;If you feel awkward, you don&#39;t have to say it now. You can tell me anytime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made me feel even more guilty to hide it from him. I tried to speak carefully. &#34;You and Andre don&#39;t look alike, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked at me and was silent for a moment. &#34;I know what you are going to tell me. I knew it long ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You knew it long ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I knew it two years ago. It was because of this that I did not dare to announce that you were my mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&#34; I was a little angry. He had clearly said that he believed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is not something to be proud of. I don&#39;t want you to think that I am just an inferior illegitimate child.&#34; Did he think that? In my eyes, the word &#39;inferiority&#39; was never related to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s very funny. Do you remember that I was a slave and a traitor&#39;s daughter at that time?&#34; I said in a joking tone. I had never fancied his identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t blame me because I think too highly of you.&#34; His words made me blush again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much do you know about your biological father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not much. He has passed away. I heard about him from my mother. And...&#34; He paused and said. &#34;And...Toby...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Toby!&#34; Oh my god, I was really frozen and forgot about Toby. &#34; Is there any news about Toby? &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s tone became impatient. &#34;I have been in the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no! If they want to kill us, they will definitely do something to Toby.&#34; I said as I got off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pressed me back into the bed. &#34;Don&#39;t move. I know there is a way to contact him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will explain this to you later.&#34; Isaac put on his shirt and got off the bed. &#34;Have a good rest now. I can sense if you are in danger.&#34; He knew that if he did not find Toby, I would do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that Isaac really didn&#39;t want to leave me now because I was the same. We had just re-established our mate relationship and needed to be with our mate to gain a sense of security. But my friend was still in danger. I comforted him. &#34;Don&#39;t be angry, Toby is a good person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the sake of Moon Goddess, I didn&#39;t go for him.&#34; Isaac frowned his beautiful eyebrows again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pointed to the middle of his eyebrows. &#34;Thank you. Toby is a very important friend for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. You must be careful.&#34; I nodded. Isaac kissed my cheek and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had never tried to establish a spiritual link. Every time, it was Toby who broke into my mind and shouted. Blood was really a troublesome thing. I didn&#39;t even know how to explain our relationship to Claudia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Claudia, do you know that Toby and I are relatives? So we are a family.&#34; This was too strange. I could imagine how Claudia laughed at me. She would definitely force me to call Toby &#34;brother&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked Caesar to search with me. He could expand the range of my spiritual influence. Although I didn&#39;t want to admit it, the power of blood was still very strong. I could feel the trace of Toby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Hey, boy, if you can hear me, just say something.&#39; I shouted in my mind. It was strange but also effective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I said don&#39;t call me boy!&#39; Toby&#39;s voice came into my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Where did you go?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Andre&#39;s people planned to sneak attack me but I escaped. How is Claudia? Is she well?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thing he wanted to ask was this? I wanted to cut off the link immediately and throw him in any wasteland. &#39;She was injured and was resting in the hospital now.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;God, is she hurt badly? I should follow her.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;She is out of danger. With Nicole, she should get better soon.&#39; I asked him impatiently, &#39;Where are you now?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I don&#39;t know. I seem to be lost.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Oh, that&#39;s great!&#39; I rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;This isn&#39;t my pack!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Don&#39;t yell in my head. What&#39;s around you?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Eh, a tree?&#39; He hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Very well, you have shrunk the area to the whole forest.&#39; I really wanted to punch him through the spiritual link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Don&#39;t mock me. I am also in a hurry to see Claudia, okay?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In our endless quarrel, I finally managed to guide him out of the woods, but I did not expect him to be in such a sorry state. &#34;Have you been attacked by a beast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is not a beast. Andre&#39;s people gave me an anesthetic needle. I escaped from the conference room window and could not see anything along the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder he disappeared for more than ten hours. He must have been unconscious somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby&#39;s tone was very urgent. &#34;Take me to see Claudia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ha! I was waiting for this. &#34;When it comes to Claudia, she and I become mate again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Why?&#34; Toby stared at me with his eyes wide open. It was this expression. I wanted to tell him immediately, but I wanted to see his expression with my own eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of fate. Also, stay away from my mate in the future.&#34; I tried to make myself sound less like I was showing off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby still maintained his shocked expression and stood where he was. It was really hard for ordinary people to imagine that there was a second chance with the same people. It was almost impossible to re-establish it. Otherwise, there would not be such a painful process of dissolving the relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stay there. Claudia is still waiting for you in the hospital.&#34; I patted the back of Toby&#39;s head in a good mood and asked him to keep up with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way back to the hospital, I felt Claudia&#39;s call through mate link. These bastards really did not give me a minute to spare. I turned and ran in the direction of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you suddenly crazy about?&#34; Toby barely caught up with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something happened in the hospital!&#34;</p>
