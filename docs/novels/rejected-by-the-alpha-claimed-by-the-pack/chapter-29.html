                <p>Toby&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t understand all of this. In the White Claw pack, there was no one who didn&#39;t respect Claudia. Our pack&#39;s Alpha, my father, told us that Claudia was a very powerful witch. He also took a long time to let Claudia join our pack. At that time, our pack had some people who were biased against witches. They thought that witches were evil and would bring disaster to the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until that time, our pack had many people who suddenly disappeared. Most of them were women and children. Originally we thought that it was rouge who kidnapped them. So we strengthened the pack&#39;s guards. However, there was still a situation of disappearance, so Alpha asked me to take some of our elite soldiers to investigate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A year ago...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carefully searched the last places where the missing residents stayed. My wolf could always smell a slight fragrance in those places, so I felt that something was wrong. After expanding the search range, I found traces of beasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We followed the traces of beasts to a cave. I was very sure that the missing people were taken away by the beasts in the cave. I asked the warriors to prepare, and the traces showed that this beast was on the same level as the lion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we went deeper into the cave, the strange fragrance appeared again. I asked the warriors about it. Sure enough, they also smelled the scent. We walked into an empty cave, and the beast&#39;s breathing sounded around us. I was about to transform but suddenly a warrior fell. I hurried to check his condition. His nose and mouth were bleeding with purple-red blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was poisoned!&#34; I shouted to the others. I remembered that the things we had touched... was only that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That fragrance is poisonous!&#34; As soon as I finished the words, a few beasts pounced on me and my team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warriors who were slower to react because of the poison were all killed by the beasts. I dragged a warrior beside me and escaped the cave. Fortunately, my bloodline was strong enough. My healing speed was barely able to catch up with the speed of the spread of the poison. But the warrior I rescued was dying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him the medicine I carried. This medicine could stimulate the power of the wolf. He looked at me. &#34;How about you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go back to the pack and find someone to save me.&#34; God knew if I could wait for rescue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I will use my fastest speed.&#34; The warrior ran in the direction of our pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed slowly. My consciousness was eroded by the poison. There was a very beautiful woman in front of me when I woke up again. The moment I saw her, I felt that time became very slow. My breathing became rapid, and my palms were sweating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman looked at me. &#34;I&#39;m here to help you. Your team member told me you were poisoned.&#34; Oh my God, her eyes were the most touching ones I had ever seen. Her clear green eyes were glowing with water. She said to me, &#34;You should feel much better now. I can only give you a light dose of antidote because I don&#39;t know what kind of poison it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; She looked like a witch, and then I suddenly heard the sound of a beast. Oh no, were we still in the beast territory?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obviously, the witch also heard the sound. &#34;What is that?&#34; She asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the thing that poisoned me.&#34; I stood up from the grass and pulled the witch to run in the opposite direction of the cave. But the witch broke free of my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to get the poison from it so that I can make the antidote.&#34; The witch said solemnly. She stood still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I weren&#39;t dizzy now, I would have carried her away. &#34;Are you crazy? I don&#39;t have much strength now. How are you going to get the poison from it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The witch didn&#39;t answer me. When the beast approached us, she pushed me away, and then she shifted to a wolf and jumped on the beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WTF&#34; Was she still a werewolf? Moon Goddess, I thought I found my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witch, or what should I call her? Anyway, she fixed herself on the back of the beast with her claws. The beast struggled wildly and wanted to throw her off the back. But she used a talisman or some other witch&#39;s gadget that interfered with the beast&#39;s spirit. The beast slowly stopped moving, and then she used magic to hypnotize the beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable!&#34; Her movements were too smooth. I had never seen such a strong witch or a werewolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she did not listen to my praise at all. She was busy cutting off a piece of gland on the beast&#39;s neck. &#34;This is the thing that poisoned you. Now I can make an antidote.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia and I returned to the pack. Her antidote helped us get rid of the surrounding beasts. Our pack&#39;s prejudice against witches slowly disappeared. I liked talking to Claudia. She always had something that surprised me. Fortunately, she did not hate me. We were always happy when we were together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would find her all kinds of strange herbs and feathers of birds. Claudia would try to brew some witch medicine that she didn&#39;t know its effect. We would play small games. Whoever lost would drink the medicine. And I always lost. Sometimes I would become strange because of the medicine. Claudia would break the cold smile on her face and laughed happily when she saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But other than this time, Claudia was always as cold as ice. Her beautiful eyes had obscurity that I couldn&#39;t understand. Claudia told me that she was actually born in a pack. I knew that a lot of packs were very unfriendly to witches. But Claudia only said that those things had nothing to do with her identity as a witch. Her past hid too many secrets. So when she decided to go back to her old pack, I did not hesitate to apply to be her assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need an assistant.&#34; Claudia said to my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is not safe for you to be alone in the enemy pack. Although Toby is young, he is one of my best warriors.&#34; My father persuaded Claudia, and I also looked at her with pleading eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia sighed helplessly, &#34;Since Alpha said so, then fine, as long as you are obedient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise!&#34; &#34;Great!&#34; I gave my father a grateful look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was happy to be Claudia&#39;s assistant and came to negotiate with her. Claudia said that she spent a long time in this pack, but it was obvious that I misunderstood her meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the first day Claudia came here, I felt the Crimson Shadow pack&#39;s hostility. It was not because she represented our pack, but because of her own hostility. Later, I found out from various places that Claudia&#39;s parents were executed when she was six years old, and she became a slave until she disappeared from the pack two years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t expect Claudia to have such a miserable past because she looked like a person who would not be bullied. She could beat most people in our pack without magic. Who would have the heart to bully such a beautiful person?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I threw all the questions to Claudia, but her expression was not good.</p>
