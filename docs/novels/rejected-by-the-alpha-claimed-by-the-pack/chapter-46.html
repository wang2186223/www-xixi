                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up from my coma, and my vision was dark. I tried to move my hands and feet, but they were tightly tied together. Only then did I realize my situation. Someone kidnapped me. The kidnapper covered my eyes and tied my limbs. My face was against the wet ground. I could feel that I was in a cold room. The air was filled with the smell of mold. This should be a basement. I recalled my memories before I was kidnapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few hours ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil wrote me a letter. He wrote at the beginning of the letter, telling me to read this letter alone because it was his secret. Since Andre was exiled, Neil had never appeared. I did not expect him to contact me. Neil told me in the letter that he was very sad these days and did not want to see anyone from the pack. I could understand his feelings. Although Andre deserved it. But he still lost his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said in the letter that he wanted to see me. The only person he could trust now was me. I felt so sorry for him. In fact, I still regarded him as my friend. In the past, when I was bullied, he once helped me. Moreover, the one who made a mistake was Andre. I should not criticize Neil. He wrote an address in the letter. It was the little garden that he had taken me to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived at the garden, Neil was already waiting there. He smiled and waved at me. I walked over and sat beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have you been these days?&#34; I asked him tentatively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, not very good.&#34; He lowered his head. I could not see his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; I did not know how to comfort him. We were not standing from the same standpoint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter. This is not something you can decide alone.&#34; Neil&#39;s tone was very sad, which made me feel guilty for him. But all I could do now was sit here and chat with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, I could feel a wolf running from behind me. &#34;Watch out!&#34; I blocked Neil behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolf stopped in front of me. I recognized it for a long time before I could see that it was Fiona. She rarely transformed, and few people had seen her wolf. Her eyes were fixed on me. I didn&#39;t know why I get her mad at me again. Maybe she thought her father&#39;s exile was because of me, or maybe she finally couldn&#39;t hide her hostility toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warning growl came from her throat, but this warning was no threat to me. Her wolf was small but not agile enough. Nicole could easily bite her to death, but I didn&#39;t need to transform to hit her. I had a better way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was about to chant the spell, Neil called my name behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not now, Neil.&#34; I had to concentrate on the spell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Neil covered my nose and mouth with a cloth. I could only breathe in a pungent smell. I wanted to pull his hand away, but I completely lost my strength. Then I fell into darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I lay on the floor of the basement. Damn, I cursed in my heart. Neil actually used my trust in him. I had no intention of reading his mind at all. He pretended to be so sad and I even felt sorry for him. Today I finally saw what kind of person he was, this bastard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat up and tried to break free, but my hands and feet were tied by chains. He should be afraid that I would break free after I shifted. I called Isaac&#39;s name in my heart, hoping that he could find me. Then I heard the sound of the door being opened, and heavy footsteps came to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hand removed the cloth strip from my eyes. My eyes narrowed because of the light. After adapting to the brightness, I saw Neil&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a confident smile on Neil&#39;s face. &#34;Calm down. I believe you have called Isaac over. This is my purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you and Fiona going to take revenge on me? What does it have to do with Isaac?&#34; I began to panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why should I take revenge on you? You are my future Luna.&#34; His eyes stared at my face and then moved to my lips. His eyes made me sick. He touched my face with his hand and rubbed his thumb against my lips. I bit his finger hard with my teeth until I could taste the blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil pulled his finger out of my mouth. He angrily pulled away the collar of my clothes. I felt a chill in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get lost! Bastard, Isaac will kill you!&#34; I wanted to struggle out of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil pinned me under him. &#34;No, he won&#39;t kill his Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was his purpose? He wanted Alpha&#39;s position? I shouted at him, &#34;Stop dreaming! You won&#39;t become Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll wait and see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of high heels hitting the ground came, and it was getting closer and closer to us. Neil cursed and then let go of me, then pulled my collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona said to Neil, &#34;I didn&#39;t expect her to wake up so soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Witches are generally resistant to medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems that Isaac will come soon. Give her to me. You go to negotiate with Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona pulled me up from the ground. I asked her, &#34;What are you going to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will know when the time comes.&#34; Fiona covered my eyes with a strip of cloth again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I saw the letter that Neil wrote to Claudia, the ominous premonition in my heart reached its peak. Now I dare not say that Neil is completely innocent. I don&#39;t know how many things Andre has revealed to him. I originally planned to ask him, but he never appeared. Because his father had just been exiled, I didn&#39;t want to force him to come out and ask him if he was part of these plots. In the depths of my heart, he was still the younger brother who needed my protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when Claudia called me, my intuition told me that Neil had done something bad to her. Caesar locked onto Claudia&#39;s position. I didn&#39;t expect her to be so close. I came to the bottom of my uncle&#39;s abandoned garden. I didn&#39;t expect that there was a secret basement here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked in. Neil stood in the middle of the empty basement, and Claudia was behind him. Claudia&#39;s eyes were covered and her hands and feet were tied by iron chains. She should have struggled. There were red marks on her wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down. I can smell your murderous intent,&#34; Fiona said to me as she pressed the dagger against Claudia&#39;s neck. &#34;Don&#39;t think about saving her with your ability. I know you will kill us. So if you dare to move, I will cut her throat immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flowed through my veins. I raised my hands. &#34;I won&#39;t move. Don&#39;t hurt her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very good. Now we can have a good talk,&#34; Neil said to me with a smile. His appearance reminded me of Andre, making me sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly do you want?&#34; My attention was on the knife on Claudia&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s very simple.&#34; Neil said, &#34;I want you to tell the commanders that I will be Crimson Shadow pack&#39;s Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this what he wants? I&#39;m really speechless at his stupidity.&#34; Do you think they will agree to let you be Alpha if I tell them? &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you laughing at me? You just need to tell them.&#34; Neil&#39;s face turned red with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t listen to them!&#34; Claudia shouted at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s knife cut a wound on Claudia&#39;s neck. She said to me, &#34;Even if you can heal your throat, but...&#34; She put the knife on Claudia&#39;s eyelids. &#34;If I dig out her eyes, can she grow another one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop! Okay! I promise you, let Claudia go immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil suddenly roared, &#34;Do you think I&#39;m stupid? The moment I let her go, you will kill me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what do you want?&#34; He was right, that was what I thought. I would never allow Claudia to be hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to hear the commanders announce to pack that I am Alpha, so that I will let Claudia go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the tip of the blade that flashed with a cold light moving above Claudia&#39;s eyes. &#34;Okay, I will go and tell them now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, I will go with you.&#34; He turned back and said to Fiona, &#34;Watch over Claudia here. If you don&#39;t receive my news before dark, kill her.&#34;</p>
