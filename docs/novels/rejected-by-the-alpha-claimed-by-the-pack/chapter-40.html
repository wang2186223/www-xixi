                <p>I killed the miner who was madly pouncing at me, but when I turned my head, Claudia was still not far from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you to run quickly?&#34; This might be the first time I was angry at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What will you do if I run away? Wait for death here?&#34; she shouted at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to drive Claudia away, but if I got close to her, she would be infected. &#34;You&#39;d better leave quickly. After I lose consciousness, I will probably attack you like that miner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breathing gradually became difficult. I no longer had the strength to maintain the form of a wolf. I looked at my arm. Purple spots had already appeared on it. I prayed for Claudia. &#34;Go! I beg you. I don&#39;t want to hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Claudia was still observing the corpses in the big pit. &#34;This pit must have been dug by Andre. He wanted to kill all the infected miners and bury them. But the people near here were all dead. No one was filling the pit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat paralyzed on the ground. &#34;Listen to me, Claudia!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia suddenly looked up at me. &#34;Wait a minute, mine! I actually forgot the most obvious clue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia ran away. This was a bit hurtful. Her figure slowly disappeared into the woods. My consciousness gradually disappeared. She wouldn&#39;t want to abandon me only now, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up again, Claudia was already back. She set up a fire beside me. &#34;Are you going to make medicine?&#34; I almost didn&#39;t recognize my voice. It was too hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake?&#34; Finally, Claudia looked up from her potion pot. &#34;I found a way to treat it. The source of infection is the mine itself. So I went to the mine to find some minerals to make medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The source of the infection is the mine? Aren&#39;t you infected too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, fortunately, I don&#39;t abandon you and run away. The reason why I don&#39;t get sick is that I have less contact with it.&#34; Claudia poured the medicine out of the pot and brought it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you can run away.&#34; It was always like this. When I wanted to show my heroic spirit in front of Claudia, it was she who saved me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am very grateful, really.&#34; Claudia seemed to read my thoughts. She smiled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said to Claudia, &#34;It&#39;s really dangerous this time. I don&#39;t intend to let Andre go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, who would have thought that the mineral is the source of the infectious disease? The mineral is harmless, but it will change when it is absorbed by the werewolves&#39; bodies. Andre is really thoughtful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank you for Moon Goddess and the witch&#39;s alchemy talent. Claudia and I came back from the edge of death, and now it was time to let Andre pay it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we returned to the Crimson Shadow pack, Andre thought that my father had signed the agreement. His face was full of smiles and he took us to the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems that our agreement has taken effect. The war is over!&#34; I believed that Andre&#39;s smile was real now because he thought that our pack was doomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Claudia sneered and said, &#34;Infectious disease? You are so smart! But you may not have heard this sentence. Don&#39;t try to deceive a witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre&#39;s face suddenly became ugly. The people in the conference room were puzzled. &#34;What infectious disease?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia said to Andre, &#34;The mine you promised to White Claw pack in the agreement is a source of infection!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What source of infection? I don&#39;t understand. There is nothing wrong with the mine. Everyone here must have seen it.&#34; He was still struggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean everyone has seen the &#39;photo&#39;. If you are so sure that there is nothing wrong with the mine, do you dare to check it with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre was silent for a while. His answer was beyond my expectations. &#34;I dare! Why not? Let me prepare. I will go with you immediately.&#34; He said a few words in his Beta&#39;s ear, and his Beta immediately left with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They must discuss some conspiracy again. Claudia asked me to stay here, and she wanted to follow Andre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay alone?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I saved your life.&#34; She also left the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Andre and his Beta to a secret small room. They seemed to have disappeared after entering the room. I entered the room, but there was no one inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There must be a secret door in the room, but I didn&#39;t have time to find it. I could only shift to improve my hearing. Then I heard Andre curse viciously, &#34;That witch, damn bitch! How did she know about the mine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down, she has found it now. We have to find a way. You don&#39;t really want to go to the mine, do you? I still remember those infected miners. It&#39;s terrible.&#34; Beta Gordon was trying to persuade Andre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I won&#39;t go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what are you going to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre&#39;s tone was fierce. &#34;They forced me. In a while, let my guards surround the meeting room. I want to kill all of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gordon took a breath after hearing what he said. &#34;Are you crazy? There are so many commanders in the meeting room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. If they have any objections, I will kill them together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a need to do this? And Toby, he is the son of the White Claw pack&#39;s Alpha. If we kill him, they will definitely attack us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think they won&#39;t attack us when they find out that there is an infectious disease in the mine? At least we can tie Toby up as a hostage later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you only want to kill witches?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are crazy. He is your son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he is not. Don&#39;t ask me what happened. I will explain it to you later. I think this witch came back to take revenge. She must want me dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I covered my mouth to stop myself from making a sound of surprise. Isaac was not Andre&#39;s child? No wonder he made Neil the future Alpha under the opposition of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it because of her parents?&#34; Gordon was indeed an insider about the death of my parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre continued, &#34;That&#39;s right. Do you remember? When the war was about to end, our Alpha was already very weak. For the better development of the pack, I decided to replace him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I remember. It was the two of us at that time. You promised me that when we joined hands to get rid of Alpha, you would let me be your Beta. But...&#34; Gordon began to hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all because of that damned Calvin.&#34; I heard my father&#39;s name. &#34;He found out about our plan and told his witch wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, if he hadn&#39;t wanted to tell Alpha the news in a hurry, we wouldn&#39;t have killed Alpha so quickly.&#34; The murderer began to blame my loyal father, these bastards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still remember that night, Alpha begged me to save his wife and children. God, I wanted to laugh when I thought of his stupid face. He didn&#39;t know that I poisoned his whole family.&#34; Andre&#39;s voice was full of venom. &#34;And it was much more relaxed after that. Framed the crime of poisoning Alpha to Calvin, who was closest to him. The pack became mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gordon continued to ask him, &#34;Was the secret of their deaths discovered by Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it was because of this. That bitch threatened me. She wanted that bastard to be Alpha. But I just promised her on the surface. When Neil becomes an adult, I will still kick Isaac out of the pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it was like this. It turned out to be like this. My whole body trembled. I didn&#39;t know whether it was because of anger or something. I knew that my parents could not be traitors. The real traitor was Andre! Nicole roared in my mind. I almost couldn&#39;t suppress her anger because my mood was very unstable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Stop, Nicole! It is not the right time yet!&#39; I tore my hair and shouted at Nicole. I could not defeat Alpha and Beta alone. But at this moment, Nicole only wanted to rush in and tear Andre apart. Silver hair slowly appeared on my arm, and sharp teeth stung the soft flesh on my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to hypnotize myself. But this caused a more violent reaction from Nicole. She controlled my body and ran in the direction of the secret door. In our consciousness, my body fell on the wall and made a muffled sound. This sound disturbed the two people talking in the secret door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They rushed out and saw me, who had already shifted halfway. Andre looked at Gordon and gave him a look. Gordon went behind me. Now I understood that they were going to kill me here.</p>
