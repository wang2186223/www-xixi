                <p>&#34;What a stupid fool!&#34; Isaac rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha! Do you see her face? I think she&#39;s going to explode.&#34; Toby laughed from the side. Neil and Fiona did bring us a lot of jokes, so Toby and Isaac reached a rare consensus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few rounds of wine, the atmosphere between us was unprecedentedly harmonious. Toby asked the bartender to put all his stock in the store. We drank for a long time. When my vision began to blur, I seemed to see that Isaac had secretly mixed Toby&#39;s cup with strong alcohol. Toby immediately fell drunk on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a child. I thought he could drink a lot.&#34; Isaac looked at Toby with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, he can drink a lot. As long as you don&#39;t secretly pour him vodka.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you saw it. I thought I did it secretly.&#34; Isaac leaned close to me and my face began to heat up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, what do you want to say to me if you make him drunk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s tone was full of nostalgia. &#34;Do you remember the past? Neil never dared to talk to me like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure it&#39;s not because you, the elder brother, are too fierce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m very nice to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Neil has indeed changed. He helped me for a while. Although I don&#39;t know why, I am very grateful to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember at that time. I begged him to help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was you?! Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh...&#34; Isaac pressed his temples and recalled, &#34;Because I couldn&#39;t protect you directly.&#34; I looked into his eyes. He was not joking. He was telling the truth. Why had he never told me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t figure it out and immediately changed the topic. &#34;And Fiona, she always stayed by your side and scared away all the girls around you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, her voice was too loud. Caesar complained to me that he was going deaf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why did you let her pester you?&#34; I asked without thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because she is Beta&#39;s daughter, and I have been friends with her since I was a child. She was not as mean as she is now.&#34; He looked at me. &#34;Wait, are you jealous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps.&#34; My brain was soaked with alcohol to say such things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Claudia...&#34; Isaac held my face. &#34;I love you, you know.&#34; He kissed me. I could feel that he was gently biting my lips and then wrapping our tongues together. The breath we were holding was the smell of alcohol, hot and charming. Isaac&#39;s hand was groping behind my back. He stroked my back, then my waist, and then down. I put my hand on his chest. I could touch his hard and warm muscles and hear his heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, we&#39;re closing the door!&#34; The bartender called us at the door. &#34;You can go home and continue.&#34; He pointed to Toby on the sofa. &#34;Remember to take him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; A low growl came from Isaac&#39;s throat. He hated being interrupted. I suddenly woke up a little. God, what was I doing? But I didn&#39;t let Isaac see my panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help me.&#34; I pointed to Toby on the sofa. &#34;This is your fault, and I can&#39;t carry him.&#34; Isaac gave me a resentful look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac threw Toby on the bed in the room downstairs. He complained to me. &#34;I didn&#39;t even know you were living together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is my assistant. It&#39;s more convenient to live together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t do anything to you, did he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you thinking? He is my younger brother.&#34; In my opinion, it was like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac seemed to have heard what I was thinking. &#34;Alright, he doesn&#39;t think so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a strange silence, &#34;So, are you going back now?&#34; I asked Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I sent you such a thing home.&#34; He gesticulated exaggeratedly. &#34;Are you going to drive me out like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, sofa. Or you can sleep with Toby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be so cruel.&#34; Isaac&#39;s low voice beat my heart. &#34;As long as you don&#39;t want to, I won&#39;t touch you. Let me accompany you, just like before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reason I made this decision was mainly because of alcohol. Nicole kept saying in my head, &#39;Let him stay!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right.&#34; Before I could finish my words, Isaac held me horizontally. &#34;Hey! Who let you be like this! Put me down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh, it&#39;s time to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gently placed me on the bed, and he laid beside me. I smelled the familiar scent of cedar again, which soothed my nerves. I unconsciously leaned close to him, hugged his waist, and buried my face in his chest. Isaac gently passed his hand through my hair, and I fell asleep with his gentle movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up, Isaac was still asleep. His eyes were covered by the shadow of his eyebrows in the early morning sun. I carefully touched his eyebrows and combed his beautiful eyebrows with my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I saw a pair of golden-brown eyes. &#34;Got you!&#34; Isaac looked at me with a playful smile. He grabbed my hand that stopped on his face. My face suddenly turned red. I wanted to withdraw my hand, but he put my hand to his lips and kissed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, stop!&#34; I pushed him off the bed. &#34;You should go, or it will be difficult to explain if you are seen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have nothing to explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued to push him. &#34;I have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not afraid of that boy misunderstanding, are you?&#34; He was talking about Toby. To be honest, I was a little worried. In fact, I didn&#39;t want anyone to misunderstand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, you should leave quickly.&#34; I pushed Isaac downstairs, but Toby&#39;s door opened at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Toby looked at me and then looked at Isaac. &#34;What did you two do last night&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Toby! Don&#39;t be so loud.&#34; He was so loud that the people around would know that we slept together last night. I sincerely said to Toby, &#34;No. Nothing happened.&#34; The agitated mood and the dizziness of the hangover came to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you explaining it to him?&#34; Oh God, they were about to start again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, hurry up and leave.&#34; I pushed Isaac towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He saw me. Why should I leave? Wait for me to finish breakfast.&#34; Isaac was so calm that it made me angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of my house!&#34; Toby continued to shout at Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think this is your house. This is our pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, okay. My head was blown up by the hangover and their noise at the same time. I felt like I was going to vomit.&#34; Alright, you two! Stop arguing. &#34;I pointed at Isaac. &#34;You, leave quickly after breakfast.&#34; I covered my mouth and ran to the toilet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here you go.&#34; Toby handed me a cup of water. &#34;It helps with a hangover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drank all the water in the cup in one go. Toby looked at me in surprise. &#34;Are you all right? Actually, you don&#39;t have to drink so fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It smells so good.&#34; I smelled the smell of butter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Toby&#39;s face was full of disgust. &#34;That bastard is making breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t expect this. I went to the kitchen and saw Isaac busy in front of the stove. Isaac knew I was coming. He shoveled the food into the pot and put it on the plate. Then he slid the plate from the end of the table in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have a taste.&#34; Isaac continued to look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He shows off again!&#34; Toby whispered in a voice that everyone could hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you say another word, eat the air.&#34; Isaac said with his back to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby swallowed his saliva and opened his mouth but could not say anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am very happy to see you two get along well.&#34; I cut open the toast on the plate with a knife, and the crispy outer skin of the toast made a tempting sound. Isaac should have wrapped the toast with egg fluid and then fried it with butter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is delicious. I didn&#39;t expect you to make this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac slammed the plate in front of Toby, who protested. &#34;Hey!&#34; Isaac sat beside me with his own plate and said, &#34;If you live with me, I will give you more surprises.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dream on. I won&#39;t live with you just because of breakfast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac said without a trace of emotion on his face. &#34;I can help you warm the bed.&#34; Poor Toby choked on the milk after hearing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be too narcissistic.&#34; I put down the knife and fork in my hand and was ready to leave the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac grabbed me, who was getting up. I lost my balance and fell on him. He said, &#34;I only do this to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take your hand away from her!&#34; Toby grabbed my left arm and tried to pull me out of Isaac&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Isaac held my waist with one hand, and his other hand was still using a fork to insert a piece of vomit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the two of them pulled, my head hurt again. I shouted in my heart, &#39;Moon Goddess, save me. I don&#39;t want to spit out the breakfast I just ate.&#39;</p>
