                <p>My father smashed everything he could see as soon as he returned home. He muttered, &#34;Bastard, damn fool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped him quickly. &#34;Calm down. What happened?&#34; My father held his hand in front of my eyes. Although the wound was about to heal, there was still a scratch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac is a traitor. He disobeyed my orders and tried to hurt me.&#34; Isaac actually attacked our father. Was he crazy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to know what had happened. I asked my father, &#34;What order? What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But father did not answer me. He only said, &#34;He kidnapped your mother! He put Victoria by his side and did not let anyone get close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did he do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you understand? Think with your brain! Because he wants to replace me! This son of a bitch.&#34; Our father was panting with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what about mother? Can I still see her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our father looked at me with contempt. &#34;Don&#39;t mention that bitch. She abandoned us! She is with Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?! I knew that our mother had a near-paranoia about Isaac being Alpha. So when she was put under house arrest because she resisted the change of the heir, I didn&#39;t go to see her because I knew what she would say after seeing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Neil, you are not suitable to be Alpha. Neil, it is better for you to give your position to your elder brother.&#34; She would definitely say that. I was also her son, why couldn&#39;t she pay more attention to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac had just reached adulthood, our mother had spent a lot of effort preparing a grand ball for him. She had invited many of the pack&#39;s young ladies just to let Isaac choose his mate. But when I was an adult, she only held a small party at home. My mate was not important because I was not Alpha. She was always biased towards Isaac, so I was not surprised at all that she had made this choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what should we do?&#34; I asked our father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kill them, kill all of them, including that damned witch.&#34; our father&#39;s eyes were bloodshot, and he was so angry that his mind was no longer clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if he really intended to kill everyone, I would save Claudia. Claudia was going to become my mate. I would not kill her. When I became Alpha, she would be my Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to calm our father. &#34;Calm down, father! We need a detailed plan. They are not so easy to kill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father touched his forehead with mine. &#34;Oh, Neil! I knew only you would support me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not only me but Uncle Gordon as well as your guards.&#34; Beta Gordon had always been our father&#39;s left and right hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, yes! I still have them.&#34; Father let go of me. &#34;I wanted to discuss something with Gordon.&#34; He left the house with his guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been searching for information about Isaac in our pack these days. If he wanted to fight us, we must know his weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his men kept their mouths shut, and I couldn&#39;t find any useful information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, Fiona suddenly came to me. I asked her, &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I&#39;m waiting for you.&#34; Fiona came up and grabbed my arm. &#34;Come and play with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated her flattering me, but I needed Beta&#39;s support now. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll go with you. Where do you want to go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona took me to a bar with many people. I rarely came to such a noisy place. It annoyed me. Fortunately, I saw Claudia in the crowd at a glance. Unfortunately, there were two annoying men standing beside her. Isaac was extremely annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What festival is it today? All the annoying guys are gathered together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona was the first to attack. Interestingly enough, she didn&#39;t seem to like Isaac at all since my father announced me as the future Alpha. I knew what she was thinking. She had &#34;I want to be Luna&#34; written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My Luna was impossible, and it would never be her. But before I become Alpha, she could still be used. Fiona automatically divided Isaac into the &#39;annoying person&#39; type. Now she looked at Isaac with eyes full of disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac ignored Fiona. He continued to talk to Claudia. In my heart, my contempt for Isaac rose again. Did he think he could steal my Luna? Or did he think he would become Alpha? Didn&#39;t think about it. With his team made up of savages, how would he deal with my father and Beta&#39;s team?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to break the arrogance on his face. I said to him. &#34;Elder brother, long time no see. The recent negotiations are really good for you. It seems that you don&#39;t have to go to the wilderness to pick up trash.&#34; I pointed to his so-called &#39;team members&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch your words! These &#39;trash&#39; can strangle you with one hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia looked at us with her hands on her face. Her eyes were full of interest. I didn&#39;t want to lose face in front of her. &#34;Are you implying something? Traitor, don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know about mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still have the face to mention mother! Where were you when she was tortured by Andre?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What torture? That was just house arrest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen to what you are saying!&#34; Isaac clapped his hand on the bar counter, and that terrifying aura appeared on his body again. His eyes turned red. Damn it, he didn&#39;t want to shift here, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing? I am the future Alpha!&#34; I shouted, telling myself not to be too afraid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Isaac immediately returned to normal. &#34;It seems that you know very well.&#34; He mocked me. &#34;You are not Alpha yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of glass shattering suddenly came from Claudia. We looked back together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my impression, the relationship between Isaac and Neil was good. I didn&#39;t expect them to be so stiff now. Their current problem might be related to the choice of the heir. I didn&#39;t expect Andre to want Neil to be Alpha at the moment. I heard that Isaac was punished for a mistake and lost his position as the heir.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been two years. Many things had changed, but there were indeed some things that would never change, such as the woman in front of me. She was still wearing the sharp high-heeled shoes, and her chest was almost squeezed out of the collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona looked up and down at Toby, then turned to me and said, &#34;There are still so many men around you, slut.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be respectful, miss.&#34; The blood vessels on Toby&#39;s arm were bulging. His good upbringing made him endure not to attack women unless the other party was a bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I patted Toby on the shoulder and whispered in his ear. &#34;I&#39;ll deal with her.&#34; Only then did Toby stand to the side with his arms crossed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked up to Fiona with a glass of wine and said, &#34;You still dare to provoke me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ridiculous. Did I provoke you? I was just here to play. I didn&#39;t expect to meet a freak gathering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you still remember being tied up by me to the cliff? The one who was so scared that she almost peed her pants was not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s face turned red because of anger. &#34;It was all because you wanted to seduce Neil, and you also wanted to hurt my friends.&#34; Her heels kept hitting the floor, and the sound was very harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I threw the glass in my hand at Fiona&#39;s feet. &#34;Sorry, it&#39;s so heavy.&#34; Blue liquid fell on Fiona&#39;s shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god! This is CL&#39;s latest model. I will kill you.&#34; She raised her hand and wanted to hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An unwise choice.&#34; I twisted her arm and pressed her hand behind my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; Fiona&#39;s face turned purple from red. She asked Neil for help, but Neil did not dare to move under Isaac&#39;s gaze. I let go of Fiona&#39;s hand and she threw herself into Neil&#39;s arms. &#34;This vicious woman, my shoulder is injured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone present looked at them. &#34;Shut up!&#34; Neil left Fiona and left in a sorry state. Fiona chased after Neil while feeling sorry for her new shoes.</p>
