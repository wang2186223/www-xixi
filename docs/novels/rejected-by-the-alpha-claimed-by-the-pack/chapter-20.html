                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the ring lying in my hand that Claudia had given me, a relic that had originally belonged to her mother. I told her to keep something so valuable for herself. But she told me that it represented her trust in me. This little ring burned my palm. My mate had given it to me and she trusted me. And I wanted to take responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been staying at the training ground for the past few days and throwing myself into training was able to clear my mind. When I broke the eighth dummy, the resolve was made. I was going to explain my relationship with Claudia to my father and mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The future Alpha of the pack would definitely be me. I couldn&#39;t think of any other possibility. I must have Claudia as my mate if I was determined enough. My parents couldn&#39;t stop it. Even if they chose Neil to be the future Alpha, the people of the pack wouldn&#39;t agree. If that happened, our entire pack would be in jeopardy. I gripped the ring in my hand, intending to confess to my parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father and mother&#39;s bedroom was still lit and the door was just ajar. I was about to knock when I heard the sound of my father and mother arguing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to pry into their privacy, I was about to leave when I heard my father&#39;s vicious words, &#34;Victoria, Is that how you speak to that bastard&#39;s father, too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I heard those words, the blood in my entire body froze. The world spun up in front of me as countless fragments of the past cycled through my head. I didn&#39;t want to deduce anything from such fragments of words, unless my mother had a child I didn&#39;t know. Bastard, I didn&#39;t dare continue thinking about it, all these thoughts made my stomach churn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You make me sick.&#34; I hadn&#39;t heard my mother lose her temper like that before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that what you want? Slut! You were the one who wanted that bastard to be the future Alpha. That&#39;s why you came to me to make the deal, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother was silent, which made my father humiliate her even more exaggeratedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every time I see Isaac, it&#39;s like a slap in my face.&#34; My body shuddered hard when I heard my name. &#34;And yet, I always feel the pleasure of the winner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I heard the sound of fabric being torn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran out of the house in a panic, breathing in this fresh air. All sorts of thoughts popped into my head randomly, which almost made me throw up. My father wasn&#39;t Alpha, which confused my perception of who I was. Who was I, then? A regular werewolf?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder I remembered how my &#34;father&#34; had treated me since I was a child. He never smiled at me. Everyone thought that Alpha was too hard on me because he expected too much from me. It turned out I had nothing to do with him. But he should have been able to find pleasure in abusing me, the pervert. Only Neil, he would smile at Neil because Neil was the child Alpha and Luna had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And my mother, hell knew what kind of deal she made to make me, a bastard, to be the future Alpha. I had absolutely no way to find out the dirty answer behind that question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was different, and the change in my identity would involve everything. Including Claudia, my mate. The one I&#39;d sworn to protect. Her ring was still with me, and I covered my face. The ring brought a slight chill that belonged to the metal, bringing me back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never confess my mate to them. I knew very well what kind of person my mother was. If she found out Claudia was my mate she would try to kill Claudia in any possible way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona found me as I was getting irritable and my thoughts were racing, and her presence made me even grumpier. I left directly, but she looked very confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go. But then I&#39;ll tell everyone the secret of that slave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What secret? Did she know that Claudia was my mate? No, no, no. She and I were the only ones who knew about this. Even Luna didn&#39;t notice that Claudia was my mate. So what exactly did Fiona know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to say in a calm voice, &#34;What&#39;s the secret? How come I don&#39;t know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t know that?&#34; The surprise on Fiona&#39;s face was replaced by a superior smile. &#34;It seems you&#39;ve been confused by those creepy green eyes. I&#39;ve checked and those eyes mean she&#39;s a witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what? If I remember correctly, her mother was a witch too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you were going to say that.&#34; It seemed she was prepared before she came to see me. &#34;And have you ever seen her mother with eyes like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t answer it. Claudia&#39;s mother was indeed a witch. But not with eyes as special and beautiful as Claudia&#39;s. Although Claudia&#39;s parents had died years ago, if she had eyes that special, I would remember them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, so what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the problem.&#34; God, I hated that look of hers where she was so sure of success. &#34;She&#39;s a witch with special powers, and if the werewolves find out, Alpha will kill her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I will believe you just because of some nonsense?&#34; To be honest, there were logical flaws in Fiona&#39;s words. She was so confident, so she must have ample evidence. All I could do was latch on to some more information that she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may not believe it. But, if you don&#39;t want me to tell others the secret, meet me in my room tonight.&#34; Fiona excitedly said goodbye to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was receiving too much information today and my brain was in a tizzy. Caesar wanted to jump out and vent because his emotions were so unstable. I could feel my canines getting sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to find Claudia right away to ask her about what happened, but I could not find her anywhere. So I had to ask the old man in our pack about the witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old man&#39;s reply plunged me into the abyss. According to legend, there were indeed witches with strange eyes. But they were all put to death because their special powers changed many things. Claudia surprisingly never told me about this, no wonder she grew up living with her eyes covered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I thought about it. If she was so powerful, why was she still being bullied all the time by the werewolves? Or was it because she didn&#39;t know her powers? My mind was full of questions, but I touched the ring on my finger. I still trusted my mate, and now the priority was to keep her secret. I walked towards Fiona&#39;s house to see what tricks she could play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona lounged lazily on her bed, simply wearing a silk nightgown. &#34;There&#39;s only one thing I want, you know that clearly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even think about it. People like you don&#39;t deserve to be Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona got up from the bed and approached me, her hand touching my shoulder. &#34;It&#39;s not up to you, honey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision started to get blurry and my arms and legs started to get weak. The place touched by Fiona had a tingling sensation like an electric shock. &#34;! You drugged me?&#34; There was a rush of heat to my lower body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a trance, I heard Fiona say, &#34;Yes, and I&#39;ve prepared other surprises for you.&#34;</p>
