                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Of course, I&#39;m ready for you to attack at any time.&amp;quot; My face with a confident smile, but the muscles of my body tensed up at this time, and my vigilance was quickly amplified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The captain and ordinary warriors were completely different, as the leader of the squad, he was far more qualified than these soldiers, both in terms of combat ability and combat experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were also the existence that was almost the closest to the Alpha in a wolf pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I now had strong witchcraft abilities, I would have to use my full strength to deal with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia be careful, I can feel the dangerous aura on this man, if you are close to his body, you will definitely be controlled by him in a flash!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole&#39;s voice rang out in my heart, and her voice made me even more alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Understood, I will definitely not let him get close to my body.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replied to Nicole inside my mind while watching the movements of the third squad leader Reyn with my pupils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reyn at this time has completely transformed into a wolf, after transforming into a wolf, his body was much stronger than those warriors, just the arms were almost twice as thick, looked like a ferocious monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reyn and I looked at each other at this time, and I was surprised to find that Reyn was actually not thinking about anything inside at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was different from other warriors, his heart was only fighting, it was pure battle consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We seriously look at each other&#39;s body every action, the whole training ground also at this time quiet, the warriors seemed to be afraid to make a sound to disturb such a tense atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly a gust of wind blew in the distance, and when a leaf was blown down to the ground, I felt Reyn&#39;s sharp claws produce a slight movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s on the move!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This thought flashed through my mind, and at the same time the spell that had been prepared in my mind was activated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witchcraft of Wood - Guardian of the Forest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Along with the monster formed by vines appearing on the ground, he also quickly weaved through the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt that his speed was far faster than those warriors, and the individual vine monsters were not able to stop him, so I manipulated ten vine monsters through my mind to rush towards him, but I saw a smile on the corner of Reyn&#39;s mouth at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No good, the vine people have no effect on him at all!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment this thought rose in my mind, I saw that in a flash three vine people were torn in half by his sharp claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reyn&#39;s power was too strong, these vine people were completely as fragile as paper, even if their recovery speed was fast, there was no way to stop Reyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected of the third squad leader, it seemed I only had to use the highest level of wood witchcraft I had mastered so far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face became more serious at this time, while the incantation ran as fast as a rainstorm in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wood sorcery, twisting trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was rapidly approaching me, the sound of the ground shaking became even louder, while under his feet, in a flash, a huge tree grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The growth speed of this tree was far from those vines could compare, and when Reyn tried to dodge it, his body was taken up into the sky by the growing tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reyn&#39;s pupils seemed to have some surprise, but he still did not panic, in the air he used his body to make a flip, the next moment sharp claws tightly grasped the bark of the tree, in those branches of the tree was about to entangle him in the moment, he jumped from the air to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Reyn, I won&#39;t let you near me.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of dangerous wind blew my hair up as his massive body zoomed in front of me, but the incantation in my mind was already recited and completed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>High Spatial Sorcery - Rapid Teleportation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was only a few feet away from me, the world in front of me shifted, and then I appeared ten feet behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What a terrifying battle, Luna Claudia was actually able to instantly unleash such a spatial witchcraft, even Reyn, he probably had no way to get close to her!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who will actually win this battle?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I think it&#39;s still the third squad leader, he&#39;s very experienced in battle, although Luna Claudia&#39;s witchcraft is powerful, but there are also breakdowns.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, I think it&#39;s Luna Claudia, as long as her rapid teleportation witchcraft can be launched accurately and continuously, our third squad leader will have a hard time getting close to her!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Different voices came from the warriors&#39; conversations, but I didn&#39;t have the time to think about their conversations right now, because Reyn once again turned his body around and charged towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wooden Witchcraft - Twisting Trees, activated continuously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My expression became more serious at this time, and my mind witchcraft worked almost completely, so that I did not think about other thoughts at all, and the next huge tree once again took him up into the sky from under his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reyn hissed again at this time and he began to jump through the rough bark of the tree, but every time his feet touched the ground, I unleashed a twisting tree to take him up into the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such movements were very physically and energetic demanding, and after just a few times, I could already feel Reyn panting violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a few more times, I would be able to completely consume his strength, and victory would ultimately be on my side!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile appeared on my face as I continued to speed up my witchcraft, but at that moment, a headache appeared in my head, which slowed down my witchcraft initiation speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My energy was depleted too much!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my teeth at this time, it seemed that this battle was a comparison of endurance, a competition between my energy and Reyn&#39;s stamina to see who would consume to the limit first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was enduring the pain to continue the witchcraft, I sensed that Reyn&#39;s speed had increased in a flash!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No good, he exploded the rest of his power!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw his body rapidly approaching me in the air, such a speed that I could hardly stop him with my energy exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was I going to lose to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at his fast approaching figure in the air, but suddenly he shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had reached his limit! Now was my chance!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this time, the speed of my mind&#39;s operation almost reached my current limit, while the world in front of me changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>High Spatial Sorcery - Rapid Teleportation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just an instant, in the air currents high in the sky, I appeared behind Reyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;My teleportation witchcraft is not only able to teleport on the ground!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I revealed a smile with all my strength at this time, while a second witchcraft was running in my mind. At this time, I sensed Reyn&#39;s panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Not only spatial witchcraft, but wood witchcraft is likewise not just able to be activated only on the ground!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my teeth at this time, while placing my palms in the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wood Witchcraft - Giant Vine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I ran out of energy, a witchcraft formation with flickering light formed in the air, while a huge vine that far surpassed ordinary vines rushed out from the witchcraft formation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Reyn, you have lost.&amp;quot;</p>
