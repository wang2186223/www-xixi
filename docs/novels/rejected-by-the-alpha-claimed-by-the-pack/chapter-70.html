                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon to arrive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight outside the window was gradually becoming stronger, and I took the crystal ball out at this time. The sunlight penetrated the crystal ball almost instantly, making it emit a brilliant light that looked beautiful like a moon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This crystal ball looks like the material used is very good, there are no impurities, using this crystal ball to play magic will definitely be more effective.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dragged my chin and admired the beautiful glow from this crystal ball until the voice of the carriage driver came from ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Guest, according to the process you set out before, we have arrived at our destination.&amp;quot; With the carriage driver&#39;s words, my heartbeat also accelerated at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of place would it be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I imagined the environment outside the carriage, but before I could get out of the carriage, I could already hear the noisy sounds outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was the chatter of tourists, the chirping of birds, and the sound of those waves, and I looked at Isaac in almost disbelief at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot; Could it be that we have come to the sea, but the White Pack is in the forest. How could we have come to the sea?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The White Pack is indeed inside the forest.&amp;quot; The corner of Isaac&#39;s mouth curled up a magnitude. &amp;quot;But just because it&#39;s inside the forest doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t a view you want to see.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze for two seconds listening to his words, then the next second I quickly opened the door of the carriage. At the same moment, the image in front of me also made me almost speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;There is actually such a sight inside the White Pack, I can hardly imagine that I am inside a wolf pack.&amp;quot; I looked in amazement at the world before me, down the stairs at the edge of the street, blue taking up almost most of my vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All kinds of carriages were parked at the edge of the street, surrounded by hills, a huge lake reflecting the blue of the sky, the width of this lake was almost more than three miles, tourists gathered around the shore of the lake, merchants with food carts weaved in and out of the crowd, stores selling snacks were opening, it looked beautiful and lively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, it&#39;s been a long time since you&#39;ve swam.&amp;quot; Isaac said as he opened the bag he had placed on the carriage. &amp;quot;I&#39;ve already prepared our swimsuit.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard his voice and shifted my eyes back, but the next moment I pouted my lips. &amp;quot;The style of this one-piece swimsuit is only liked by grandmothers, right? It doesn&#39;t even show the waist.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to protest, but I didn&#39;t expect force to come from my waist the next moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;There are so many people on this beach, I don&#39;t want other men to see too much of your beauty.&amp;quot; Isaac pressed my waist to his, and then his chest gradually curved downward, his hot breath blowing almost to my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, you need to know that everything you are is mine, and no one else can even look at it more than once.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lost my voice as I watched his seductive caramel pupils, a heat spreading upward from my neck and quickly spreading to my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was almost out of my mind looking at him at this point, and I got closer to him uncontrollably, but he was the first to let go of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t be lost in thought, do you still want me to help you change into your swimsuit?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the bad smile at the corner of his mouth. I quickly sobered up, the atmosphere just now was instantly ruined by him completely. I couldn&#39;t help but pinch the flesh on his waist fiercely. &amp;quot; Jerk, I&#39;ll change it by myself.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We moved quickly, the anticipation in my mind seemed to be the gear that accelerated my body&#39;s movement, and once I changed into my swimsuit, we quickly rushed up the beach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, don&#39;t you want to eat some beach snacks?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, I&#39;m going to swim to my heart&#39;s content first, and we&#39;ll talk about it when I want to eat.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind at the lake blew my hair back, the freshness was almost about to run through my body, the sand under my feet came with a delicate touch. I took Isaac&#39;s arm and rushed towards the vast lake, when the first drops of water in the lake touched my skin. That kind of cool touch almost made me mesmerized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The atmosphere here is really great; I admit that I feel surprised here again!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water gradually rose from the bottom of my feet, and it was as if I had entered a soft package. The sunlight overhead was very warm, but all I could feel was a coolness that made me incredibly comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The feeling of swimming is actually so comforting, this is not at all comparable to being in the bathtub.&amp;quot; I used my hand to fiddle with the water in the lake. In this position, the water came to my waist, but was only able to cover Isaac&#39;s thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my head and smiled at him. Isaac&#39;s swimsuit was a pair of loose-fitting light blue shorts with a perfect art-like muscular silhouette depicting his upper body and a blurred upper body of him in the reflection of the lake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking really the most perfect man in the world, I had some intoxication in his perfect and full of power body, but at this time I felt some other sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These eyes caught my attention and I turned my head towards the surrounding beach and I noticed that there were actually some female tourists peeking at Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, is there something over there?&amp;quot; Seemingly noticing my gaze, Isaac tried to turn his head towards the beach, but I pressed my hand against his face at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You&#39;re not allowed to look.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; Isaac&#39;s voice showed some confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;If I say you&#39;re not allowed to look, you&#39;re not allowed to look.&amp;quot; I pouted my lips and glared at him, then I took his arm and continued to walk deeper towards the lake, not stopping until the water covered my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my head at this point to look at the shore, and at this distance, we were already some distance from the river bank, and without surprising me, I didn&#39;t feel the sight that annoyed me anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Isaac said I was all about him, then he was equally all about me, we were all about each other, and I didn&#39;t want another woman peeking at my man&#39;s perfect body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, what exactly did you not want me to see just now?&amp;quot; Isaac raised his left eyebrow, as if he was still curious about what had happened earlier, but I still shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No questions allowed.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia ......&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac seemed to be about to say something else, but I suddenly moved closer to him and kissed his sexy lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed him hard, and then I left quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;If you want to take control of the initiative, beat me at swimming.&amp;quot; I smiled and gave him a look, then swam quickly toward the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, you&#39;re fouling.&amp;quot; Isaac seemed frozen for a moment, but soon the desire to conquer appeared in his mind. &amp;quot;You better pray you don&#39;t get caught by me!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly accelerated my swimming speed this time, but I heard the sound of water splashing away from behind me at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was catching up!</p>
