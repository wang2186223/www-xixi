                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Isaac left, I touched the temperature he left on the bed. I covered my face with the quilt. The smell left on it was the most familiar wood fragrance, the warm black wood, and the cold snow pine. After the relationship between Isaac and I was rebuilt, Nicole became stronger. I could feel that my wound was healing faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole woke me up urgently when she heard so many people coming at me aggressively. I climbed out of bed, still with a dull ache in my chest. I opened the door and the doorway was already full of people. They had scared the nurse on duty away, and the pack doctor was angry. He said to those people, &#34;This is a hospital, what do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd was slowly separated, and Andre came out. &#34;Calm down, doctor. They are all my people. I want to talk to the lady inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor still showed respect for Andre. &#34;Alpha, you will disturb the patient like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre grabbed the doctor&#39;s neck. &#34;Our Beta was almost killed by the witch inside, and you still helped her?&#34; He let go of the doctor, and the doctor kept coughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre came for revenge. No one could stop him here. I could only call my mate in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They approached me step by step, and I could only sit back on my bed. Two werewolves stood guard outside the door, and they closed my door. In fact, there was no difference even if they did not close the door. Since Andre dared to bring people to the hospital, it meant that he was going to be completely hostile to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre walked up to me. &#34;Do you know how they executed the witches?&#34; I did not look at him. He continued, &#34;They will tie the witches to the stakes and burn them to death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get her!&#34; I was grabbed by the arms of two strong werewolves. What to do? I was considering whether shifting was a good idea. No, it was too small here, and there were so many people on the other side. If I used magic, I wasn&#39;t sure I could hypnotize everyone. I touched the ruby ring on my hand, using flame magic to burn the place down would still involve the hospital patients.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andre stood in front of me. He said, &#34;Your injury is recovering well.&#34; He tore off my shirt. My upper body was naked, and the wound was exposed in front of his eyes. His eyes scanned my body. &#34;This is the reason why Isaac like you. Of course. I like it too.&#34; Andre laughed wildly. Nicole screamed and tried to tear his ugly face off. My anger made me ignore the pain in my body. I struggled out a hand, which made my wound tear again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took out a bottle from the bedside and threw it on the ground. The dust in the bottle immediately filled the room. I chanted the hypnosis spell. Andre shouted to his men, &#34;Cover her mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was too late. The people he brought were all unconscious on the ground. I was also paralyzed on the ground because of the consumption of the spell. Andre shook his head. &#34;Do you think your little tricks are useful to me?&#34; He was going to throw himself on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think so, so I&#39;ve been waiting for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The locked door made a loud noise, and the door was forcibly destroyed from the outside. Isaac and Toby rushed in. Isaac hugged me, and I quickly covered myself with broken clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he do to you?&#34; A terrifying aura appeared on Isaac again, and I could hear the sound of his teeth grinding against each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He only tore my clothes. I used hypnosis, so he didn&#39;t do anything, and you came here.&#34; I was afraid that Isaac would lose control, so I didn&#39;t say anything else about Andre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Isaac directly shifted and bit off Andre&#39;s right hand. Before we could react, Andre grabbed his severed arm and howled loudly. Isaac pounced on him and stepped on his head with his claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t kill him!&#34; I shouted to Isaac, &#34;If you kill him, my parents will not be able to clear their name!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used mate strength to turn Isaac back into human form, and Andre wanted to take this opportunity to sneak attack. His face was scratched by Toby as soon as he shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pulled out the gun at his waist and pointed it at Andre&#39;s head. My heart almost stopped beating. He said, &#34;I&#39;ll teach you how to use the Water Silver gun.&#34; Isaac shot Andre&#39;s legs, and Andre could only twitch on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I breathed a sigh of relief. Isaac changed my clothes for me and carried me to another ward. He sat beside the bed and held my hand. I could feel his uneasiness. I touched the back of his hand with my thumb. Toby stood awkwardly at the door. Isaac must have told him that we had reestablished our mate relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stand at the door. Come here.&#34; I really couldn&#39;t bear to see Toby&#39;s expression. &#34;I&#39;m very happy to see that you are fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby asked me in a low voice. &#34;Are you mate now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. But I haven&#39;t decided whether I want to be his mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Both of them looked at me in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never said I forgave you. Do you think I forgot what happened two years ago?&#34; I deliberately made my tone harsh. Isaac turned away from my sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; Isaac looked at me guiltily. God, I was a sinner, but it was too interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I still have a chance?&#34; Toby&#39;s tone was obviously happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. What did you say?&#34; Isaac glared at Toby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You clearly heard it.&#34; Toby sat on the other side of my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t think that I won&#39;t kill you just because of our blood relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a minute, what is the blood relationship?&#34; What did I miss? It&#39;s getting more and more interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s face was full of regret. Toby said, &#34;You are mate now. Do you still want to hide it from Claudia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you think I hid it from her? You...!&#34; I interrupted his swearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is it?&#34; I showed great enthusiasm and looked at Isaac with pleading eyes. He sighed and confessed his blood relationship to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spiritual link? This sounds very convenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac covered his forehead and said, &#34;Believe me, more annoying.&#34; Toby said disdainfully beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you are cousin?&#34; I looked at them excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Unexpectedly, I got two objections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! It&#39;s so lovely!&#34; I took their hands and they immediately quarreled again until the doctor came to warn them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was glad they became family. In my life, there were very few people I really cared about. I didn&#39;t know if I would leave them too early because of the Witch&#39;s Fate curse. When that time came, I hoped they could help each other.</p>
