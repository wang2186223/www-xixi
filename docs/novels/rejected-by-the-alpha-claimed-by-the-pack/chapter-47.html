                <p>Neil&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and I waited at the battle center. Not long after, the commanders came over. I didn&#39;t expect that Isaac&#39;s influence could allow him to gather all the commanders, and they were not even willing to listen to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dean said to Isaac, &#34;I urgently called all the commanders over. What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac glanced at me and then turned to them, &#34;I want to recommend you the next Alpha, my younger brother Neil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all showed surprised expressions. Dean said to Isaac, &#34;But, we want you to...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that they wanted Isaac to be Alpha, so when Andre was released, I immediately hid. Otherwise, they would definitely force me to give up Alpha&#39;s position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said I don&#39;t want to be Alpha!&#34; Isaac&#39;s tone was very urgent. I believed that his attention was not here at all. He then said to the commanders, &#34;Neil has Alpha&#39;s blood. I can&#39;t think of anyone else who can take over Alpha&#39;s title.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A commander looked at me and said, &#34;To be honest, it&#39;s not that we don&#39;t believe in Alpha&#39;s blood, but we don&#39;t believe in Neil&#39;s ability. If we are invaded by another pack, how can we expect a weak Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dare he say that? With my ability, I have more than enough to lead them. This damn lowlife, I will remember his name. When I become Alpha, I will find a chance to kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am still in pack. I will help him.&#34; Isaac&#39;s tone had turned into a pleading tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held back my anger and continued to say, &#34;With my brother&#39;s help, I believe that I can be a good Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commanders looked at each other. They knew that they had no other choice. Dean looked at Isaac. &#34;Since you have said so, we have decided to make Neil the new Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem, tell the pack members immediately.&#34; Isaac was still in a hurry to save Claudia. He urged the commanders, and Dean could only announce my identity to pack with great dissatisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac glared at me, and I nodded to indicate that he could go to the basement. Now, I was going to prepare my coronation ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After receiving a message, Fiona quickly left the basement. It seemed that Neil had achieved his goal. I lay on the ground for a while and heard the rapid footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac untied the chain that bound me. He touched the red mark on my wrist. &#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;I&#39;m fine. Is Neil already Alpha?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34; There was no emotion in Isaac&#39;s tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I was too careless.&#34; I was full of guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not your fault. I didn&#39;t expect him to be like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But... you were supposed to be Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said I didn&#39;t care about that.&#34; Isaac picked me up and I insisted that I could walk, but he carried me all the way back to the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of the excessive shock and exhaustion, Isaac hugged me and fell asleep on the sofa. When I woke up because of the high heat, it was already midnight. My body was abnormally hot. I wanted to look at myself in the mirror, but I fell back on the sofa because my hands and feet were weak. Isaac woke up because of my movements and he hugged me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have a fever? Why is the temperature on your body so high?&#34; He used his lips to test the temperature of my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; But when Isaac touched me, I felt that the high temperature had decreased a lot. This symptom reminded me of a very familiar feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac buried his face in my neck. &#34;You smell great.&#34; His words were a little ambiguous. I touched his face with my hand, and his body temperature was incredibly high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place where Isaac touched me felt like an electric current, and there was a slight numbness. He pressed on me and kissed me randomly. My chaotic brain finally remembered this familiar and strange feeling. This was a rut. When we re-established our mate relationship, we should have thought of it. It was easy to trigger rut when staying with mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac?&#34; I tried to push Isaac off me, but he held me and was unwilling to let go. This was the worst situation. He must have also entered rut. In the two years of not having a mate, I had forgotten that rut could have such a big impact on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me hug you.&#34; I felt dizzy because of his words. He reached his hand under my shirt, and his touch made me feel a fire gathering under my abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body was uncontrollably close to him, and the high temperature of rut burned my brain. I unconsciously clamped Isaac&#39;s strong waist with my legs, and his eyes were full of deep desire. &#34;I guessed you agreed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lowered his waist and entered me. The inside of my thigh twitched because of this.&#34;Slow down.&#34; I begged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t hurt you.&#34; Isaac pushed into me slowly, and I groaned because of his movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Isaac&#39;s pulse in my body. He breathed heavily in my ear, like a large cat. He licked my neck with his tongue and teeth. I knew he wanted to mark me. I trembled because I was too comfortable, and his movements became fierce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was about to orgasm, countless sparks flashed in front of my eyes, and sparks crackled in my brain. Isaac bit the mark on the back of my neck with his sharp canine teeth. All my muscles tightened and I had an orgasm in his marking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay on Isaac&#39;s chest, feeling like a pool of melted cream. The sweat we sweated made my whole body sticky, but I was not in a hurry to take a bath. After being marked, I only wanted to stay beside my mate. I could feel safe in his smell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although rut was a long process, I didn&#39;t know where Isaac got so much energy. He was willing to let me go until dawn. I was about to faint. So when I woke up again, the soreness all over my body reminded me of what a crazy night I had been through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake?&#34; Isaac brought a plate in front of me. I felt that I hadn&#39;t eaten for a year. The food on the plate made me salivate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used a fork to insert a piece of roast lamb steak into my mouth. The fragrance of vanilla and meat juice filled my mouth. &#34;This is very delicious. Have you learned how to cook?&#34; Ever since I left the pack, I didn&#39;t want to step into the kitchen again. It always reminded me of my bad memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s very simple. Just look at the menu and make it.&#34; Isaac&#39;s tone was very sincere. There was a kind of people in the world. Anything was simpler for them. He pushed aside the hair behind my neck and touched the mark point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I trembled. &#34;What are you doing?&#34; He almost made me drop the food on the quilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what this means. You are mine.&#34; Isaac&#39;s tone was full of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored him and continued to eat the lamb chops on my plate with a fork. Of course I knew what the mark meant. His smell had been around me, so as to tell everyone that I was his possession. This mark would always exist until one of us died.</p>
