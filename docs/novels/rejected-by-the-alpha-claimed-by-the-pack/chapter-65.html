                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I mean...this really is such a surprise ......&amp;quot; Claudia&#39;s green eyes had tears in them, the glow of the hot air balloon surrounding us made her green eyes look even brighter. I looked at her eyes and took a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heartfelt preparations did not disappoint her, and my earnest plan worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I planned to make her look like a princess during this honeymoon, to make up for the childhood she missed as a child. In hindsight, my plan was a great success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed at her green pupils. Those eyes always had a magic that I could get lost in, it was a beauty that only she could have, she was a princess that belonged only to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cupped her cheeks with my hands and traced the contours of her cheeks with my fingers. I felt her soft and smooth skin, surrounded by the endless light outside the window. I just wished we could stay in this moment forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m relieved to hear that answer from you. I said I wanted you to be in for a surprise every single day for the seven days, and today&#39;s mission is accomplished.&amp;quot; I looked at her with a smile on my face, her smooth lips seemed to reflect the glow of which hot air balloons, the pink made her lips look more enticing, I watched her bite her lips, but I wished more than anything that it was my lips she was biting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I should kiss her hard now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I thought this, I saw her beautiful face dilate inside my pupils, and the enchanting scent of vanilla and flowers rushed into my nostrils. She nipped at my lips with her teeth as I felt her softness pressed against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to admit that I froze for a second at this point, but I reacted quickly and chased her soft tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was mine! My mate, she was so perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We kissed to our hearts&#39; content. I stroked the back of her head and her ears with my hands, we could both feel each other&#39;s breath and heartbeat, at the very top of this Ferris wheel, at the farthest point from the ground, but our hearts were closer together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night was falling, the people inside the park had left some, we told each other stories from our hearts inside the sightseeing bus, and after we walked down from the Ferris wheel, I watched her blush and grab my sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But, before we leave, I want a lollipop from over there.&amp;quot; Her voice was trailing off and she looked a lot like a little girl asking for candy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isn&#39;t that one for kids?&amp;quot; I couldn&#39;t help but laugh, but I didn&#39;t hesitate, and after telling her to wait where she was, I walked toward the kids in line ahead of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I vowed to give her the best love and make up for the lost joy of her childhood, within the last few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line was long, some fathers or mothers were in line with their children, some older children were in line alone, and I was the only adult in line alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes fell on me, and I listened to their curious talk about me, but my heart was full of happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Children&#39;s words are always so innocent, and their voices always manage to take me away from the darkness of the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I silently followed the procession until the pink candy cart, decorated like a fairy tale, appeared in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which one would Claudia like? I looked it over carefully, then picked out an oversized lollipop from inside that reached almost a foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought Claudia would like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held the lollipop in my hand and almost all the kids let out a gasp as I turned my head at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia ...... look at this ......&amp;quot; I was just about to call out to Claudia when, the next moment, the lollipop in my hand fell to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Damn, what are you doing!&amp;quot; Anger exploded in my heart in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw four or five werewolves surrounding Claudia, and one of them covered Claudia&#39;s mouth with a white handkerchief from behind, and they were trying to drag her into a nearby white wagon!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Damn it, you guys move fast and get out of here right now!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You two get in the wagon and run away immediately, we&#39;ll hold Isaac off!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their panicked voices reached my ears, and as I saw them preparing to escape, the flames of anger almost burned me as I transformed into my wolf form and then rushed forward as if I were crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop him. If we can take this witch away, our Alpha will be able to control his horrible power!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;For the sake of the great Alpha, our sacrifice is worth it!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Along with the voices of these werewolves, three werewolves transformed into wolves in front of me, their limbs were shaking from the aura I released, but they defiantly blocked my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw that Claudia was unconscious, and after the two werewolves dragged her into the wagon, one of them tried to get the wagon moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Damn it, I&#39;m going to kill you all.&amp;quot; Anger stole my sanity in a flash, and I charged directly and quickly toward the wagon, not caring a bit about the three werewolves who were in my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They blocked my path and they tried to attack me with their claws, but the next moment they were knocked to the ground by me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, Isaac is coming!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The werewolf driving the wagon made a terrified sound, and by this time the wagon was just starting to move toward the front, and in front of it stood a child who was so frightened that he lost his reflexes, so I lunged at the wagon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Stop!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled in mid-air and as I landed on the ground, my claws grabbed the horse&#39;s neck while I extended my claws tore into the horse&#39;s throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The white horse was hissing, he was innocent, but I had to end his life at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood bloomed red in front of my eyes, the horse fell to the ground under my power, the child only now reacted and cried out. I had no extra time to comfort the little boy. My most important task at this moment was to save my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, how is it possible!&amp;quot; The werewolf sitting on his horse fell to the ground uncontrollably, he struggled quickly, he wanted to transform, but I wasn&#39;t going to give him that chance. I came in front of him, along with a flying gush of blood. I didn&#39;t hesitate to pierce his chest with my claws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Damn, why is his power like a monster? Run quickly, leave that woman alone!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Sh*t! The guards of the White Pack have found us; we can&#39;t delay any longer!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These wolves whose identity I didn&#39;t know were shocked by my power and lost their courage. They fled towards the surroundings, but now I didn&#39;t have time to worry about them. I quickly shifted into human form and carried Claudia inside the wagon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to keep her safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, wake up?&amp;quot; I called out to her, trying to wake her up, but she was already in a deep coma, and I sniffed the breath of her nostrils and found that there was a drug in her breath that made people unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Those damned bastards!&amp;quot; I gritted my teeth hard and looked around towards the area. I found that the guards of the White Pack had gone from different directions to capture these werewolves who didn&#39;t know their identities, and they couldn&#39;t escape at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Why are these werewolves kidnapping Claudia!&amp;quot; I gnashed my teeth in anger, I wanted to go and tear them apart, but Claudia was still in a coma and I couldn&#39;t leave her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as the guards captured these guys, I was able to force them to tell me what they wanted to do, but when I thought about it, I stared at my eyes wide open, because I saw that these werewolves actually fell to the ground at the same time, and in a flash they all lost their lives.</p>
