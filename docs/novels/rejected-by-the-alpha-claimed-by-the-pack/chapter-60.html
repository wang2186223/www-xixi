                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We swore to each other under Moon Goddess&#39; blessing. Isaac looked at my eyes like melting gold. I suddenly had an impulse to kiss his eyes. But Isaac kissed me first. There was a sweet taste between my lips and teeth. Thank fate for letting me meet my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After experiencing so much suffering, we could finally get happiness. We were two persons who came back from the edge of death. I didn&#39;t know what could separate us from our intertwined fate. Isaac looked at me firmly. I could feel that the bond between us was deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were many familiar faces at the wedding to give blessings to us. Marina drank wine in the corner. I ran to her excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations.&#34; Marina raised her glass to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for everything you have done for me. I&#39;ve received too much help from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In fact, many people envy you. There are very few witches who can live like this. Cherish it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it was Richard and his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for coming.&#34; Isaac and Richard shook hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to witness your wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Toby?&#34; I asked Luna quietly. I was still a little worried about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t come with us. You don&#39;t have to worry about him. He will get better in a while.&#34; In fact, I could understand him even if Toby didn&#39;t come, but I still felt a little disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the ceremony, Isaac stopped me. &#34;Someone is looking for you.&#34; I looked at him doubtfully, but he didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac took me to the parking lot. He pointed to the figure not far away. &#34;I know you have been worried about him. Go and talk to him. I will wait for you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby was wearing a hoodie and jeans. He should have just run out of home. I walked to him and he stood in silence for a while before finally speaking. &#34;I thought for a long time and thought that I should come to bless you. I hope you can be happy forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. This is very important to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that guy standing in the shadows. If he dares to bully you, I will definitely beat him up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby gave me a friend&#39;s hug and turned to leave. I prayed to Moon Goddess, hoping that he would meet someone who really loved him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac took me to our new home. I looked at everything in front of me and was stunned. I didn&#39;t know how he did it in such a short time. The carpet was a new product we just saw in the magazine. I walked into the room. The big bed could let five people sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to try?&#34; Isaac hugged me behind me and kissed the mark on the back of my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a minute.&#34; Finally, I struggled out of his kiss. &#34;The wedding dress will be broken. It is very expensive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac took off his suit jacket and threw it aside. &#34;I don&#39;t have time to wait for you to take it off slowly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one can break my wedding dress!&#34; I glared at Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll help you.&#34; Isaac took off my veil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I don&#39;t need the most is your &#39;help&#39;.&#34; I pushed him into the bathroom. &#34;I&#39;ll be fine when you come out of the shower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat by the bed in my nightdress. The sound of the water in the bathroom had not stopped. This made me inexplicably nervous. We had done it many times, but today it always reminded me of the first time I had been with Isaac. We were in that narrow basement. I was hot because of the rut. Every touch of Isaac made me feel very comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This thought made my body heat up again. Just then, Isaac came out of the bathroom. His body was still emitting wet water vapor. Drops of water dripped down from the hair on his forehead. Under his broad shoulders were the beautiful pectorals and abdominal muscles. A towel was draped over his waist, revealing his sexy V-line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you stunned?&#34; Isaac asked me with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I turned my head to hide my red cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pulled off the towel on his waist and trapped me in his arms with two strong arms. &#34;I have shown you everything on my body. Now it&#39;s your turn.&#34; Looking at his eyes that were lit up by desire, my palm touched his chest. His throat let out a low gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pressed me down on the bed. His hand reached through the edge of my nightdress. I groaned because of his touch. I felt the temperature of his body and the comforting weight. He kissed and licked my chest. There was a warm rush out of my abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready?&#34; Isaac&#39;s low voice made my chest swell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34; I was ready to accept him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac entered me, my scalp was numb. I bit my lips to prevent myself from moaning. Isaac licked my lips as he struck me. When I kissed him, there were always a few moans coming out of my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gentle and fierce collision made my brain melt. He bit the marker at the back of my neck, and in the slight pain, I immediately reached the peak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, I felt our souls overlap, and my nails grabbed Isaac&#39;s back. I gasped for breath and enjoyed the aftertaste of happiness, but Isaac&#39;s hand rubbed on my body again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was early in the morning, Isaac hugged me and sat on him. &#34;I don&#39;t want it, let me go!&#34; My voice was hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did I tell you before? One day, you will be punished for the attitude you spoke to me..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I beg you?&#34; I didn&#39;t want to be unable to get out of bed tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, punishment is punishment.&#34; Isaac entered me again, and I could only groan weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, when the sun shone on my face, I leaned against the soft and warm pillow. My &#39;pillow&#39; leaned over to help me block the sunlight coming in through the window. I opened my eyes and saw Isaac&#39;s strong pectoral muscles. Then I looked up, and his eyelashes cast a small shadow under his eyes. I couldn&#39;t help but touch the stubble on his chin. He opened his eyes and looked at me. &#34;Good morning, my Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning.&#34; I kissed his lips softly. His lips were very soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any plans for today?&#34; Isaac asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right, but I just want to lie in bed now.&#34; My waist was sore. Last night, Isaac tormented me so much that I almost didn&#39;t sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we going on our honeymoon in bed? It&#39;s a good proposal for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honeymoon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They gave me a holiday. We have about a week.&#34; They were referring to our pack&#39;s commanders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can go anywhere, as long as I&#39;m with you.&#34; As I spoke, my head hit his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pressed me down on the bed. His handsome face was facing above me. &#34;You should stop talking. I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t help it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God!&#34; I bit his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and I ate our breakfast leisurely. He was finding our honeymoon location on the map. The sun shone on his chestnut hair. He looked at me and smiled at me like an angel. This was the happiest moment of my life. My heart was wrapped in honey. This was my dream all along. The fairy tale that was once torn up became my life. Thank fate for letting us meet. Finally, I got true happiness.</p>
