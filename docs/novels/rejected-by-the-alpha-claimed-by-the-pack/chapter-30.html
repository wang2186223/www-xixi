                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby was like a tireless puppy. I should have understood on the day I rescued him. He would definitely pester me and won&#39;t let go. This was also why I didn&#39;t want to bring him to the Crimson Shadow pack. He will definitely clarify everything before he gave up, just like now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can only tell you that my parents are innocent.&#34; I didn&#39;t want to mention my past anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe you, but those people are scolding you behind your back.&#34; The puppy&#39;s face was full of righteous anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care what they say behind my back because they don&#39;t dare to say it in front of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby was still dissatisfied with my unfairness. He took my hands and looked at me with his dog eyes. &#34;I just hope you can be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby gave me a comforting hug. Whenever I was sad and depressed, he would always find various ways to make me happy. He was like my younger brother. I patted his head to let him let go of me but was interrupted by an angry shout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This voice was too familiar. I had heard this voice countless times in my dreams. I didn&#39;t know why Isaac had come to find me, but I wouldn&#39;t forget the harm he had done to me two years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac walked up to Toby and pulled me out of that embrace. &#34;Who are you? Why are you hugging Claudia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same question, who you are? What does it have to do with you that I hold Claudia?&#34; Toby must know Isaac. He was just unconvinced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am her mate.&#34; When Isaac said this, Toby and I froze in place. When I heard this word from his mouth again, my heart was bitter again. Did he want to admit our relationship only after things had come to this? It was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby looked at me with shock and confusion. I pulled my arm out of Isaac&#39;s hand. &#34;We had already broken off the relationship in front of Luna Victoria, your mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Isaac hugged me directly. His other hand pressed the back of my head and kissed me. At that moment, my mind was blank and I could only feel the familiar smell. His lips were still as soft as before, and my nose was surrounded by the smell of cedar. I looked at his golden-brown eyes. His eyes were much fiercer than before, but they also carried some fatigue, like an injured beast. His kiss was still so strong that I was not allowed to refuse. My memories were brought back two years ago by this kiss. He once hugged me all night and accompanied me through the rut. At that time, it was the first time I felt the warmth that people other than my parents brought me. But...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed Isaac away and gave him a slap. &#34;Are you crazy? You are not qualified to do this a long time ago.&#34; To my surprise, Isaac lowered his head and did nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I pulled Toby away. Originally I decided not to have anything to do with him. I came back this time just to find out the truth about the death of my parents, but now I still felt heartache when I thought of the scene of him betraying me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby, who was pulled by me, suddenly stopped. He was also very strange just now. This child, who was too protective of me, had no reaction to what Isaac had done to me. Normally, he would definitely fight with Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, nothing.&#34; Toby still looked thoughtful, but since he didn&#39;t want to say it, I didn&#39;t intend to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave Claudia a comforting hug. I wanted to let her know that I would always stand by her side. Claudia touched my head. I was obviously an adult, but she always treated me as a child. I wanted to avoid her hand, but Isaac appeared out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he snatched Claudia away, he still questioned my identity? I also asked him. Of course, I knew who he was. It was rare for this pack&#39;s people to worship him as the real Alpha. I could not understand this pack&#39;s style at all. But as long as he dared to hurt Claudia, I would punish him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I heard him say that he was Claudia&#39;s mate. His words shocked me. I had never heard Claudia say that she had any mate or she had dissolved the relationship. This also made me feel disappointed. I knew that Claudia had many things that I did not know. But I did not expect that these past events involved such an important thing in her life. If only I had known her earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac forced a kiss on Claudia. I should have beaten him up badly. But just then, my wolf felt something. Probably because of the strong mood swings, Isaac&#39;s aura unfolded quite a bit. I could feel a strong sense of oppression in him, something I hadn&#39;t felt from any werewolf. But even if the oppression was so strong, I didn&#39;t feel dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf told me that Isaac was a companion. How was that possible? Isaac was the eldest son of the Crimson Shadow pack&#39;s Alpha. He was our most dangerous enemy. However, my wolf promised me with absolute certainty that he could smell that Isaac was my blood relative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blood relative&#34; I was shocked by this unexpected information. So when he forced a kiss on Claudia, I was absent-minded. I knew that my father had only been with my mother before he became Alpha. And I had no other blood relatives except my brother and sister, unless...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I saw Claudia&#39;s assistant hugging her, the feeling of losing her became even stronger. I wanted to kill her so-called assistant. She was mine! I cried in my heart. I didn&#39;t know where this assistant came from. How could he be so intimate with Claudia?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strong sense of jealousy and possessiveness dominated me. I kissed Claudia in front of her assistant. Oh my god, Claudia&#39;s taste was still so good. There was always a sweet taste between her lips and teeth. I hugged her tightly, her soft waist attached to my body. I wanted to integrate her into my bone. Her green eyes looked at me in surprise. I could see a trace of wavering in her cold eyes. I wondered if she still had some feelings for me in the depths of her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she pushed me away without hesitation. I could only hear a &#34;slap&#34; sound. The strength of the slap was not heavy, but my face began to ache as if it was burning. Her words were like a knife stabbing into my heart. This was what I deserved. No matter what she did to me, I would silently bear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Claudia left, I touched my lips. The touch of her lips still lingered on. I missed this feeling too much. The gentleness and love she once gave me was the life-saving straw that saved me from hell. I searched for her like crazy over the past two years. Now she came back. I swore to Moon Goddess that I could never lose her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days after Claudia came here, the negotiation began soon. I usually disdained participating in this kind of political activity, but I was worried that Andre would bully Claudia in the negotiation. In order to protect her, I also sat on the chair in the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the long table in the conference room, Andre and Claudia sat opposite each other. Andre&#39;s face was still as arrogant as ever. I didn&#39;t want to see him at all. Claudia and her assistant sat opposite and whispered to each other. I tried not to see them. I told myself that they were only friends. Although Claudia&#39;s smile at his assistant was so dazzling to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The process of negotiation was usually boring, nothing more than the two sides arguing over more territory or more money. Sure enough, Andre offered to give the White Claw Pack a million dollars in compensation, of which 70% was in cash and 30% was in jewelry instead. This was a large amount of compensation, and the White Claw Wolf Pack could use this money to continue to strengthen their pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But, &#34;I refuse!&#34; Claudia said in a cold and firm tone.</p>
