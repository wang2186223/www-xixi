                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was still immersed in my sleep, a loud noise from the collision woke me up. I put on a loose shirt and walked out of the room, looking for the source of the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you are awake! Sorry.&#34; Toby looked at me pitifully. &#34;I just wanted to make breakfast for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you were going to blow up the kitchen. As a werewolf, you are really not dexterous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! What does this have to do with me being a werewolf? Some people are not suitable for cooking.&#34; He cleaned up the mess on the stove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you are dexterous enough, you won&#39;t let them fall to the ground.&#34; I squatted down and picked up the pot and shovel that had fallen on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel Toby&#39;s gaze on me. &#34;What are you looking at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby shifted his gaze away. &#34;No.&#34; He blushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All right.&#34; I leaned against the marble table to adjust the coffee machine and then crossed my legs. The hem of my shirt could only cover the roots of my thighs. &#34;Looks like I won&#39;t have breakfast today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby wanted to see but dared not look at me. He grabbed his wallet and rushed out the door. &#34;I will buy it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shouted at his back, &#34;I want croissant! Hot from the oven!&#34; When he slammed the door, I couldn&#39;t help laughing. God, teasing him was the most interesting thing in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent a day reading books at home until the sun went down. Toby just came back from outside. &#34;You won&#39;t be sitting here all day today, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a problem?&#34; I picked up the teacup on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are like an old woman now. Let&#39;s go out and have fun.&#34; His face seemed to be plated with gold under the setting sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you tired?&#34; Although he was not dexterous enough, I had to say that his physical strength completely surpassed most werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; He pulled me up from the chair. &#34;Come on! We haven&#39;t gone out to play for a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help it. I still couldn&#39;t resist Toby&#39;s dog eye attack. As expected of the youngest child in the family, he really knew how to act spoiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, this is the &#39;fun&#39; you were talking about?&#34; Toby brought me to a popular bar. It was the kind of bar where the security guard at the door looked at people with his nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34; I could smell his excitement. &#34;When you came in, all of them were looking at you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not everyone. I was too lazy to refute him, and a group of girls couldn&#39;t move their eyes away from him the moment he came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But since I was here, so be it. &#34;Toby greeted the bartender skillfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you are a regular here?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; He pointed to the outside and said proudly, &#34;Do you see the people lining up outside? Thanks to me, we can come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, wait a minute.&#34; He waved to a table in the corner. &#34;I&#39;ll be back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was like a busy bee. Toby could always make friends quickly, even if he was in a hostile pack. I waved to the bartender. &#34;A glass of Margaret, thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man walked behind me. He smelled of disinfectant mixed with ancient dragon water. &#34;Hey, beauty. Can I buy you a glass?&#34; He slowly approached me as he spoke, and then put his hand on my chair. I had begun to calculate how much strength I could use to dislocate his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. She already has a partner.&#34; Toby wrapped his arm around my shoulder and pulled me over to him. He tilted his head and smiled at the man. &#34;She&#39;s mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me. Who do you think she belongs to?&#34; a low male voice I was familiar with said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice caused a small wave of exclamations in the crowd. He was only wearing a simple black shirt tonight. The second button was unbuttoned to the collar. The muscles on his chest made the shirt look good. The sleeves were rolled up to the forearm, making him look casual and elegant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;He&#39;s really sexy.&#39; I praised in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Exactly.&#39; Nicole appeared out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That shop is amazing. Wine and music. Most importantly, beautiful girls.&#34; Bill said. &#34;Come, Isaac. Join us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled and shook my head. Bill was the rouge I met outside the pack. Now he was a member of my team. When I met him in the wild, he was already dying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still hesitating whether I should save him because, in a place like the wilderness, the stories of farmers and snakes had happened too many times. Usually, this kind of person would beg me to save him, but Bill&#39;s attitude towards me was absolutely not pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said to me. &#34;If you save me, I will help you kill people. Don&#39;t ask me to do anything else. I don&#39;t know anything other than killing people.&#34; This was good. I saved his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be said that Bill&#39;s performance on the battlefield was like a mad dog. So I was very glad that he was my man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no time and was not in the mood to play during the past two years. I said to them, &#34;Forget it, you go. I have something to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be a killjoy, Isaac. You never go out with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, just come with us. All you have to do is stand there and the girls will be drawn to you.&#34; The team members began to jeer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They looked at me with pitiful eyes as if I could decide their sex life tonight. &#34;Alright, alright.&#34; I could not bear such a serious accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then when I saw Claudia, I was very glad that I had come here tonight. She looked great tonight, and all the women looked at her with resentment. Of course, because she was there, the men would not look at others. She tied up her silver-white hair high. The white-gold suspenders merged with her dazzling skin, and the black cowhide skirt wrapped her perky buttocks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man beside me also saw Claudia at a glance. They whispered to me. &#34;Did you see that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That witch? Buddy, she&#39;s so sexy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, someone went to hit on her.&#34; The man put his hand on Claudia&#39;s chair. I remembered him, the man in a tight vest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s going to suffer. That&#39;s a witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was going to teach the man a lesson when I saw Toby holding Claudia&#39;s shoulder and provoking the man. Did he forget my warning? I went straight to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me, who do you think she belongs to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s mine. Is there a problem?&#34; Toby stood in front of Claudia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw Claudia punch Toby&#39;s back. Her movements were secret, but her strength was not small. &#34;Who is yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby&#39;s smile disappeared because of this punch. He resisted the urge to cry out. I only felt it was funny. I looked at Claudia. &#34;I thought you did not like this kind of place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t talk as if you know me very well.&#34; Claudia sat back in her chair with her back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I used to know, but I may not know now.&#34; I leaned against the bar and looked at her. &#34;But there are some things that will never change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia did not speak. Toby stood between us. &#34;Don&#39;t bother her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up, both of you.&#34; Claudia held her forehead. &#34;If you want to quarrel, I will leave immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;It&#39;s all your fault!&#39; Toby shouted in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Get out of my head!&#39; This damn spiritual link, how could I be related to such a troublesome boy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You make her angry. She&#39;s never been so mad with me.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Very good. He didn&#39;t listen to me at all. &#39;You&#39;re annoying, boy. This is our business.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Don&#39;t call me boy, you gloomy, ferocious monster.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Oh, sorry, did I scare you before?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, enough. What are you doing now? It&#39;s too strange.&#34; Claudia frowned and looked at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forgot that to Claudia, Toby and I just stared at each other and didn&#39;t say anything. It was really quite bizarre.&#34; Nothing.&#34; I wasn&#39;t going to tell Claudia about my birth yet, not just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Coward.&#39; Toby&#39;s voice sounded in my mind. If not for our blood relationship, I would really kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I smelled the familiar perfume, Claudia and I looked at each other at the same time. It seemed that she also smelled it. Immediately my mood fell to the bottom, and Claudia&#39;s expression became cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What festival is it today? All the obnoxious guys are gathered together.&#34; Fiona fiddled with her rhinestone-encrusted nails through her hair. She wrapped her arms around Neil, her breasts pressed against Neil&#39;s body.</p>
