                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, watch out behind you!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole&#39;s anxious voice appeared inside my head, the fast approaching footsteps behind me brought a bad feeling. I wanted to shift into a wolf, but the feeling coming from inside my body stopped me from doing so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit, werewolves couldn&#39;t shift into wolves when they were pregnant!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could consider my next move, a force took control of me from behind me, and at the same time, I saw another unidentified werewolf next to me holding a white gauze towards my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These werewolves moved very quickly, the gauze dilated inside my pupils. I knew something would definitely go wrong if I was covered by the gauze. I didn&#39;t have any time to hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, use your witch powers!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole growled anxiously, but there was no way she could occupy my pregnant body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, why I had no way to read these werewolves&#39; minds!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The werewolf behind me was controlling my hands and feet, and the werewolf in front of me was trying to use his gauze to blindfold my nose, but when I found a chance to look directly into their eyes, all I could feel was a haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the middle of these werewolves&#39; foreheads, an ancient mark seemed to shine brightly before my eyes, rendering my ability to read thoughts completely ineffective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac ......&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These mists seemed to transform into fear that consumed me, and I only had time to let out one last cry before the drug of the gauze on the werewolf&#39;s hand sent me into vertigo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These days of relaxation had made me lose my vigilance against danger ......</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blurred consciousness engulfed me, as if I was caught in a nightmare of an endless abyss and I struggled with all my might to wake up, but there was no way to do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how long it took, the dream seemed long and short, but I felt my surroundings getting warmer and warmer when I suddenly opened my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ceiling and chandelier appeared before my eyes, warmth and charm wrapped around me, and I saw Isaac holding me in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac, what&#39;s happening to me ......?&amp;quot; I looked around warily, but I realized it was just the hotel bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t I captured by those unidentified werewolves?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I remember, a few werewolves put me in a coma through a drug specifically for witches!&amp;quot; I started to stroke my body and cheeks, the gauze that had made me faint seemed to reappear before my eyes, but Isaac held me tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His warm hot breath and voice rang in my ears as I poured out my fears and powerlessness to him. The air around him seemed to dispel the fog in my mind, and I felt immensely relieved in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran my hand over his straight nose and thin lips, the appearance of those werewolves who suddenly appeared still in my mind, the mark in the middle of their foreheads was indicating that there must be a powerful witch behind them!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I became more determined inside at this time. I&#39;ve been too relaxed lately; these kinds of comfortable days have made me slowly lose my vigilance. I couldn&#39;t transform into a wolf because I was pregnant, and with not much magic I had learned to deal with a quick crisis, I was in the most dangerous situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must learn more magic to deal with crises!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Guests, this is Beta of the White Pack, and the identity of those attackers has been investigated clearly.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I heard a knock at the door and I felt Isaac&#39;s face change. We looked at each other and then immediately got up from bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I freshened up briefly almost as fast as I could and then followed Isaac as he opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Who the hell were those attackers?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard Isaac&#39;s tone become serious, and I could even feel the killing intent contained within his voice, but this killing intent generated because of me didn&#39;t make me feel cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It&#39;s the Blood Moon Pack.&amp;quot; The White Pack&#39;s beta had some heaviness in his tone as he walked into the living room with a stack of information and proceeded to place it on the living room table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Blood Moon Pack?&amp;quot; Some confusion and anger appeared on Isaac&#39;s face. &amp;quot;I&#39;ve only vaguely heard the name of this pack, but I don&#39;t have any grudge against them at all. Why would they have someone attack Claudia?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m not sure, I&#39;ve banned people from the Blood Moon Pack from entering.&amp;quot; Beta of the White Pack said as he opened the information placed on the table for investigation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This pack has been living in the relatively remote north, it also seems to have little communication with other packs, and only recently has it become active.&amp;quot; After saying that he looked at me, with some apologies inside his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I am sorry that I have no way to investigate clearly what purpose they have, but this pack actually did something bad in our pack. I have already had someone notify the other packs, their behavior will definitely trigger the discontent of other packs.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Along with his voice, Beta of the White Pack turned around and walked towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Next, we will absolutely ensure the safety of our pack. You can rest assured that you can enjoy yourselves in our pack.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Blood Moon Pack ......&amp;quot; The footsteps of Beta of the White Pack were fading away, and I heard Isaac silently recite the name of the pack, and an angry aura rose up on his body, but it soon disappeared like smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, there is nothing more to come, now that the Blood Moon pack has no more access to the territory of the White pack, and ......&amp;quot; he gazed at me with serious eyes, and then a surge of power came from my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Our honeymoon period isn&#39;t over yet.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my feet leave the ground and the next moment I felt him kiss me with his warm sexy lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac ......,&amp;quot; I hugged him back tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight outside the window contrasted sharply with the dullness in the corner of the house, the light was gradually becoming blinding, his caramel pupils looked unbearably serious in such a light, and I heard his thoughts at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m going to protect you with everything I have, and our pup.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through his eyes, I felt his self-condemnation and also love, which washed away all my uneasiness and made me even more determined to become stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I understand, I will never doubt your heart, Isaac.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We kissed hard, I felt his powerful lips and tongue, breathed in his enchanting scent, until I felt my brain was a little short of oxygen, and we ended the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Today&#39;s surprise will not be missed either. Our honeymoon period is precious and I will make up for the scare you got last night with the next surprise.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I saw the corners of his mouth show a nice curve at this time, and then I felt him use his power to carry me out of the hotel with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of surprise would it be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anticipation rose up in my heart, and I didn&#39;t look into his eyes at this time to prevent me from reading the surprise he wanted to give me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to respond to the surprise he was giving me with the attitude he was expecting so that I could better respond to his expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pumpkin wagon was waiting in front of the hotel at exactly eight in the morning, and by the time we got into it again, I started the day with Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I never thought something like that would happen last night.&amp;quot; The driver&#39;s voice came from in front of us as the pumpkin wagon began to move down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;But I&#39;ve been in the White Pack for almost ten years, and I&#39;m sure you can rest assured of the safety of the place.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tourists on the street began the day&#39;s tour, and the driver&#39;s voice seemed unmistakably calm, and my heart relaxed a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes wandered between the exquisite carvings of the buildings around the White Pack, and although what happened yesterday was buried in my heart, I would not let it affect my mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, some noisy noises ahead reached my ears and I saw the periphery of an alleyway crowded with guests who had come to visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is something happening there?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You mean those crowded guests in front of us?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had some curiosity to look ahead when the voice of the driver came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;This is because, recently, a wizard who is said to have the ability to foretell came to our pack. All those who want to request his prophecy can get his help by just spending some money, his magic power is really very powerful.&amp;quot; The driver&#39;s voice gradually took on some longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ve never seen such magical magic with my own eyes.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Precognition?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said it loudly with my eyes wide at this time.</p>
