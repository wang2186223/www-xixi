                <p>I really wished we could stay happy like this forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cool sea water wrapped my whole body as I swam in the lake to my heart&#39;s content. Isaac was following behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to his normal speed, he could easily catch up with me, but he did not do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if there was a tacit rope connecting our souls, and we were enjoying this state of mutual chase at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The joyful laughter of the tourists on the shore of the lake came through, the birds on the lake flew past me, the water splashed away in front of my eyes, and I could even feel some fish in the lake sliding past my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so relaxing that all the thoughts in my mind seemed to be emptied by the natural scenery here, and I became one with the lake, and the residual fatigue inside my spirit was purified without any trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, if you do not work hard, I will soon catch up with you, I guarantee you will regret it!&amp;quot; Isaac&#39;s voice pretending to be fierce came from behind me, but all I could feel was sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, you won&#39;t catch me at all, I&#39;m not even swimming hard.&amp;quot; I responded to him provocatively, then picked up my speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This chase continued, the sun was shining gently over the head of the lake, the sunlight and the waves of the lake were intertwined, making the whole lake seem to be radiating light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden gust of wind blew, the waves in the lake rolled up along with the wind, and the light reflected on the surface of the lake began to tremble, making me feel as if my whole being was in the light, and these pieces of light seeped in from every corner of my body, and the darkness in my whole body seemed to be dispelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sun moved slowly over the lake and I swam without pause until exhaustion began to set in and I felt my speed slow down, then two warm hands crossed my waist and embraced me from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, do you admit defeat?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strength made me instantly float up from the water, and my body&#39;s exhaustion partially disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;ve got you, now I&#39;ll see how you can run.&amp;quot; Isaac&#39;s neck and the back of my neck pressed together, his lips almost behind my ear, along with his breath, I felt his wet and warm body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, you haven&#39;t quite caught up!&amp;quot; I pouted and tried to break free from his embrace, but I realized at this point that I was indeed tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cool water of the lake took away all my strength and all I could do was stay in Isaac&#39;s embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sparks arose between the contact of our skin, perhaps because of the lake, I felt his skin become smoother, and when I pressed against him, the feeling of suffocation had surged from my chest up to my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body was becoming less and less strong, and as we touched, the temperature rose in our center, and it was as if I melted into his body, completely taken over by his power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It has caught up with you, and you can no longer escape, you belong to me.&amp;quot; Isaac&#39;s voice became more powerful in my ears, and suddenly I felt him move his body forward, our necks pressed together in a flash, and he nipped my lips with his teeth, and continued to deepen the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breathing was becoming rapid with his rhythm as he wrapped his lips around my tongue and proceeded to suck on it as hard as if it were jelly, and I felt as if I were about to be swallowed by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac ......&amp;quot; My body was also gradually becoming hot, and we kissed fiercely in the water of the lake, until I was really about to lose my breath. Isaac separated from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, I can feel your body almost smooth to the point of no friction.&amp;quot; Isaac&#39;s mouth tilted out at an angle as he put his hand in the water and proceeded to make smooth contact with my torso, his hand caressing me as if it were the tentacles of an octopus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are you trying to ......&amp;quot; his searing heat passed over my body. I looked at the shore at this time. I found at this time we were right behind a huge reef, the distance between the people on the shore and us was almost a few hundred feet. No matter what we were doing here, no one would notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body relaxed a little more at this point and I felt the heat coming from his body as he held me tighter and then I felt his erection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;No, now that you&#39;re pregnant, the most important thing to me is your health and our baby, I just need a little time.&amp;quot; Isaac held me tightly in the water, and because of the lake&#39;s current, it was as if the distance between him and me was transcended, and the intense electricity of just holding together had almost paralyzed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listened to his gasps, then I looked up into his caramel pupils, and I saw inside these seductive eyes, in addition to desire, more than a protective heart for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, we were not in each other&#39;s bodies, but we were closer in our hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, let&#39;s go to the reef.&amp;quot; Along with Isaac&#39;s voice, his hands became stronger on my waist, and my body quickly surfaced under this force, and then I sat on the smooth plane of the reef exposed to the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac let out a deep breath at this time, accompanied by a cloud of exploding water, he sat beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Isaac, I&#39;m looking forward to my next destination more and more, it&#39;s as if I&#39;m roaming inside the land of fairy tales, with you.&amp;quot; I leaned into his heaving chest and we wiggled our feet in the water, our bodies close together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The next surprise will never diminish, and I swear here to the moon goddess that I will bring such beauty to you with all my might in the future time.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the water waves echoed in my ears, as if this was the entire lake playing music for us, people on the far shore of the lake still playing tirelessly, the glow of the lake surrounded us, and the shells blown up by the water waves quietly lying beside us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a world that belonged to just the two of us, and we sat quietly, embracing each other&#39;s bodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so engrossed in this wonderful time that I didn&#39;t want it to stop, and if I had to give this time a deadline, I wanted it to be a thousand years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We watched the glow of the lake change and waited for time to pass until the sun overhead came to the edge of the mountains surrounding the lake and I saw the dim yellow light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, it&#39;s time for us to get out of here.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What&#39;s for dinner?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I won&#39;t tell you, that&#39;s what the surprise is about.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You&#39;re such a surprise maker ......&amp;quot;</p>
