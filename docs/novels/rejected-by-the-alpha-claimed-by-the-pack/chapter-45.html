                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since we became mate again, Isaac rarely left me. He was staying in my house now and disturbing me when I was busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put the peacock feathers into the medicine, and the medicine smelled like protein burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It smells bad. What are you doing?&#34; Isaac walked to me and asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This thing can make your intelligence return to three years old, although I think it is no different from what you are now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think this thing is useful.&#34; Isaac combed my hair with his hand. &#34;For the enemy, its efficiency is too low.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Use your brain to think. If you want to get rid of a king, will you kill him directly? You will be chased to death. But if you use this, everyone will only think that the king is crazy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So your client wants to get rid of the king?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Business secret. Do you have anything else to do now?&#34; I looked at him, putting the medicine away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unfortunately, no.&#34; Isaac pulled me between his legs and sat me down. &#34;Can&#39;t you rest for a while? I&#39;ve been here watching you for a few hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems that you can see that I&#39;m busy.&#34; I wanted to stand up, but he held me tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac whispered in my ear, &#34;Don&#39;t move, or I will lose control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could only let him put his chin on my shoulder and put his face on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me!&#34; I was covered in the smell of herbs and bird feathers. &#34;I&#39;m going to take a shower.&#34; Isaac let out a snort of laughter. I could feel the vibration of his chest behind me. Finally, he let go of me, and my ears were hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran into the bathroom and covered my cheek with my hand. The temperature on my face burned my hand. God! I always blushed easily in front of Isaac. I took a few deep breaths and took off my clothes. I put my hair down and walked into the hot water. Isaac opened the bathroom door and came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God, get out of here.&#34; I covered my body with my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing to be shy about.&#34; Isaac said, &#34;It&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t seen it before.&#34; He took off his wet shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you dare to take off your pants, I&#39;ll throw you naked on the street,&#34; I said, but my eyes uncontrollably looked at his beautifully defined muscles. He was like a Greek sculpture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole urged me to touch his abs and v-line with my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Stop!&#39; I couldn&#39;t let Nicole take control at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Come on! I can feel that you want to touch him too.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;These are two different things. I haven&#39;t prepared to establish this relationship with him again.&#39; Every time I had intimate contact with him, I could remember the scene from two years ago. He hugged Fiona, and a chill surged up my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think you can throw me.&#34; He scanned my body with his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; He touched the side of my waist, where there was a mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the mark of a witch. A witch who has passed the &#39;transformation&#39; will have this mark.&#34; I answered him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Transformation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you leave the bathroom. I will explain it to you slowly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Isaac put down his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole suddenly jumped out. She controlled me to hug Isaac and kissed him hard. Oops! Isaac&#39;s eyes turned red. He pressed me against the wall of the bathroom, and his tongue moved in my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, or rather Caesar, kissed my lips bright red as he licked and nibbled on my chin, then moved to my neck. Did he want to mark me here? I wanted to push him away, but Nicole did not give me a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac suddenly let out a painful roar. His eyes turned back to a normal golden brown. He pinched my cheek and said, &#34;Although I wanted to continue, I knew it was not her intention, right? Nicole.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole roared in dissatisfaction. I took back control. &#34;Was it Caesar just now?&#34; I asked Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, he heard Nicole calling him.&#34; Isaac kissed my cheek. &#34;I know you don&#39;t want me to touch you now. I will wait until you agree,&#34; he said with a smile, but I could feel his disappointment. When Isaac walked out of the bathroom, the emptiness filled my heart again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona walked in front of me. Her sharp shoes made annoying noises on the ground. I said to her, &#34;Can&#39;t you stop for a while?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped in front of me. &#34;I think you are so calm. Isaac is going to become Alpha soon. Think about it, how will he retaliate against us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t hear her say this. &#34;Why should Isaac? He has been banished by me a long time ago. I am the future Alpha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you shouting at me? Who in the pack doesn&#39;t know that the commanders want Isaac to be Alpha?&#34; Fiona threw her blonde hair behind her shoulder. &#34;They don&#39;t like your performance in war. Simply put, they think you are too weak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bullshit! I am the legitimate heir!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Inherit who? The pack&#39;s traitor?&#34; Fiona played with her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled her hair. &#34;Your father is also a traitor. Don&#39;t forget that we&#39;re a team now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona painfully told me to let go. There were a few strands of golden hair between my fingers. &#34;Are you crazy?&#34; She rubbed her scalp. &#34;Then what are you going to do? Kill Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, I couldn&#39;t kill him. That was the problem. Isaac was a monster. No one among the people I knew could kill him. &#34;We need to find his weakness,&#34; I said to Fiona.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac&#39;s weakness?... I know.&#34; Fiona whispered her plan in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impossible, I won&#39;t hurt Claudia.&#34; I still wanted her to be my Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;God! Neil!&#34; She screamed at me. &#34;It was all because of her. They banished your father and my father! We can&#39;t even say goodbye to them. They will die in the wild!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her harsh voice irritated me. &#34;Can you tell me something I don&#39;t know?&#34; She described the wild as a huge cemetery, but she was the one who beat Claudia up and kicked her out of the pack. &#34;Anyway, we are just acting. Do you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are really unreasonable.&#34; Fiona rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going to make me impatient. I glared at Fiona. &#34;Do you want to cooperate with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. I can only promise not to kill her.&#34; She said, &#34;What, how can you deceive Isaac without some blood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This b*tch, when I became Alpha, her good life was over, but I needed her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a deal. When you become Alpha, I will become Luna.&#34; She looked at me greedily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s a deal.&#34;</p>
