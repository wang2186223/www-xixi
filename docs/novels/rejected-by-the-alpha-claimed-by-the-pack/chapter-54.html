                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next scene I saw was dizzy. One rouge leaned close to my face. &#34;You heard it too. This witch is very rare. Let&#39;s take her back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other rouge answered him, &#34;Yes, if she satisfies the boss, maybe we can continue to fuck her.&#34; He let out a wretched laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, I can&#39;t let them take me away. I can&#39;t imagine what will happen next. I know rouge&#39;s way of doing things too well. The cold touch of the mercury gun is still on my waist. I moved my fingers and wanted to secretly take out the gun. But they immediately found my movements. One of them, rouge, was groping on my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See what I found?&#34; He pulled out the gun from my belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is an unexpected surprise.&#34; The other rouge held the gun in his hand and observed. The gun itself was not precious, but the production of mercury bullets was complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rouge pulled my hair and lifted my head. &#34;In a while, don&#39;t try to play any tricks in front of our boss. Otherwise, I will shoot this bullet into your beautiful eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was carried by a rouge. I felt dizzy and dizzy. I wanted to call Isaac&#39;s name, but my consciousness seemed to be floating in the clouds. I could not control my mind at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my tongue hard to let myself regain some consciousness, hoping that this special medicine to the witch did not affect my wolf. &#34;Nicole!&#34; But there was no response to my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind was disturbed, and I did not know where Nicole had run off to. In the chaos, I caught a trace of something different, just like a faint cedar smell. The mark Isaac gave me helped me regain a little of my consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nicole!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quickly tell Isaac about my situation.&#34; After saying this to Nicole, I returned to a chaotic state, hoping that she could connect to Caesar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure how much time had passed. rouge threw me to the ground, and now I couldn&#39;t even move a finger. A tall black shadow walked up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find me a woman. A beautiful woman.&#34; The black shadow approached me and I felt something moving on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, she is a witch. She is also a very rare one. I heard that they have different abilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha, a witch. You did a good job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rouge&#39;s boss picked me up and placed me on a soft platform. The texture of the fabric was under my hands, and I guessed that it was a bed. Then I heard the sound of clothes being torn apart in a trance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to struggle, I wanted to shout loudly, but I didn&#39;t even have the strength to open my mouth. In front of him, I was a cloth doll at his mercy. My skin felt a burst of warmth. Something touched me randomly, and I was so disgusted that I wanted to vomit. But my mind seemed to be in another place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch!&#34; Suddenly I heard a roar, and then a warm and sticky liquid flowed on my body. I smelled a strong smell of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Claudia is in danger!&#34; Caesar suddenly popped up in my mind. I called out to my mate in my mind, but she seemed to have disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know where she is? I can&#39;t feel her.&#34; I asked Isaac hastily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure either. Nicole only sent me a message. She disappeared too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it, I could only use the most primitive method. I immediately rushed to Claudia&#39;s room. There was a strange smell in her room. I followed the smell and found a bloody knife. The blood on it was not Claudia&#39;s, but another person I was familiar with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called Toby through the spiritual connection. &#34;Do you know where Claudia is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you asking me? The person who is with her every day is you. Did something happen to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is in danger. I can&#39;t feel her. I only found a knife in her room. It is your blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My blood? I know where she is! Hurry to the forest on the east side of pack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept running. Toby was also on the way to the forest. He told me that he was attacked by rouge over there yesterday. However, the other party stabbed him and ran away. He also felt puzzled. Someone must have used this as bait to trick Claudia into a trap. I was not sure if the other party was rouge, because rouge would not come up with such a delicate plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had just entered the night. The full moon hung in the sky. Today&#39;s moon made me feel very uncomfortable. She emitted a dangerous hazy red light. When I walked into the forest, I could clearly smell Claudia. There was also the stench of rouge. Caesar let out a low roar. I hoped that I could save her in time. If something happened to her, I would not be able to forgive myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed her scent to a camp of rouge. &#34;What are you doing?&#34; A guard rouge stopped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to talk nonsense with him. I punched him in the face. I could hear the sound of his skull cracking. rouge and the others clearly felt me. They surrounded me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I could kill them, but now I didn&#39;t have time to do this. I spread my aura and rouge retreated. I approached rouge in front of me. He knelt on the ground and trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of monster is he?&#34; rouge whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only felt this aura from Boss. We will die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I smelled Toby. He attacked one of the rouges. &#34;Go find Claudia!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kicked open the only wooden door in the camp that could be called a house. Then I saw Claudia being pressed down by a huge rouge. Her clothes were torn and tattered. rouge touched her body and rubbed his dirty things against Claudia&#39;s thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body was faster than my brain. By the time I reacted, my hand had already passed through rouge&#39;s body. Anger burned my blood vessels like fire. I wanted to kill him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rouge, who was pierced by me, let out a painful howl. He turned into a giant brown wolf in front of me. I saw his wound rapidly healing. I had never seen any rouge with such a powerful healing ability. He pounced on me and roared at me. I could smell the stench in his mouth. His saliva flowed down his sharp teeth to my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caesar roared in my mind. I heard the sound of my bones being dislocated. He forced me to transform. Just like the night when I was about to die, my heart was beating violently. Everything in front of me turned red. &#34;Kill them all!&#34; My voice kept shouting in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear of death enveloped me. My body suddenly trembled. This horrible feeling awakened a trace of my consciousness. I tried to open my eyes, wanting to see the source of my fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far from me, a grey-black wolf and a brown wolf were biting each other. Their bodies were very large and their healing ability was very strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac?&#34; The grey-black wolf&#39;s eyes were bright red. It seemed that he could not hear my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed the sheet to cover my body. I wanted to leave here, but the medicine Fiona gave me still made my legs weak. I fell down after a few steps, but I did not feel pain. Someone caught me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; A familiar voice asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to identify the face in front of me. &#34;Toby? Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s talk about this later.&#34; He took out a small bottle from his clothes. &#34;Drink this first.&#34; I used his hand to drink up the liquid in the bottle. It was the smell of the antidote that I was very familiar with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My consciousness slowly woke up. Toby whispered to me, &#34;You can sneak out now. rouge and the others are besieging Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked in the direction of Isaac. He was surrounded by rouge, but rouge did not dare to approach the battlefield between him and rouge. There was a rouge who tried to sneak attack, but his ribs were broken by Isaac&#39;s claws. He could only lie on the ground and spit blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rouge, who was holding my water silver spear, shot him from behind. Isaac did not have any reaction after being shot. He crushed the hand holding the spear and rouge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t leave now. Isaac looks very strange.&#34; I can feel that my mate has separated me, but he has completely lost his mind on the other side of the wall. His attacks are full of killing intent. I can&#39;t see any sense of reason in his red eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know! I can&#39;t connect with him. He will kill you,&#34; Toby shouted in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grey-black wolf knocked the brown wolf down with one paw. He pounced on the brown wolf and bit his skin and flesh. The roar of the brown wolf penetrated the whole forest. The surrounding rouge was shaking and their tails were clamped. The brown wolf wanted to get up, but Caesar&#39;s huge claws stepped on his throat. He sent a distress signal to his subordinates, and rouge finally rushed up together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like hell on earth in front of me. The black shadows of trees lay across the red ground. It was not because the red full moon was shining on the camp, but because the blood had soaked the ground. There was only a bit of flesh between the brown wolf&#39;s head and neck. Rouge&#39;s limbs were scattered on the ground, and the smell of blood in the air was very strong. It was like we were in the belly of a beast. I covered my mouth to prevent myself from vomiting. Toby&#39;s face also turned pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only wolf that survived that battle was a grey-black wolf. His fur was stuck together with blood. He stared at me and Toby with red eyes. I couldn&#39;t see any shadows of Isaac and Caesar in his eyes. The one in front of me was a monster. His eyes were full of bloodthirsty desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby stood in front of me. &#34;He has gone crazy. I don&#39;t know how long I can stop him. Run!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to watch you die?&#34; I don&#39;t intend to leave. I want to try to use my ability to control his thoughts. Although I have never succeeded for more than a second, I can&#39;t let Isaac go crazy and kill Toby. Then he will destroy himself.</p>
