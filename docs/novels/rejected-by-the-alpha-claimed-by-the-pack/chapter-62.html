                <p>&#34;Isaac, I have the bloodlines of a witch and a werewolf, and you have the bloodline of a powerful werewolf.&#34; Surrounded by flowers, I lay on his chest and stroked his cheek. &#34;What do you think our children will be like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think our pup will be born with magical powers, and it will be a powerful werewolf.&#34; Isaac seemed interested in the topic, and he looked at me with his charming caramel-like eyes. &#34; Do you want a pup?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath mixed with the scent of flowers blew inside my nostrils, such an enchanting scent almost filled me up, and I felt such a wave of heat stretching upwards from my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ...... am not .......&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to explain my words, but he bit the softness of my chest with his teeth in the next moment, and his movement stopped my words in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sparks spread where our skin touched, my body heated up again, the comfort took away all my strength, my voice took on a little surprise at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We did it just ......&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is once enough, you just say that you want pup, of course, we have to try harder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched him come above my body, surrounded by flowers, the sunlight coming straight down overhead, making his golden brown hair look even brighter, and he seemed to become even more attractive and sexy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lines of his muscles depicted his body as if it were art, and I looked at his body as if I were under a spell. I never thought that his body would shine so brightly under the sunlight, as beautiful as the body of a god.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath became short and the temptation seemed to scratch at my heart. I grabbed his hair with my hand at this time and then relaxed my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to him, in such a beautiful sea of flowers, we will try to give birth to a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Claudia, in the wrapping of these flowers, in the bright sunlight, you really are so beautiful that I can&#39;t believe my eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s voice came from above me, his warm palms caressing my body. Suddenly his voice stopped, and the moment he plundered my breath with his mouth, he entered me powerfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a rush of breath, I began to pant incessantly. I didn&#39;t close my eyes, but looked at his beautiful pupils, his toned abs, and I was lost in extreme pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the scent of flowers, with occasional petals falling on our bodies, I gazed at his cheeks and stroked the tip of his tantalizing nose, our eyes locked together in a dream-like world where our union seemed like a divine one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept looking at him, etching his face deep into my heart as I felt his steady power crashing against my body, coming to the peak of physical pleasure as I reached the limit of my desire again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how much time had passed, and I wasn&#39;t even sure how many times my body had peaked, but I could see the sun overhead shifting its direction. It came from the east above our heads to the west, and it was only at this point that I went limp in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you even tired? I feel like I&#39;m going to be unable to get up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I&#39;m tired, but I don&#39;t want to stop when I see you.&#34; He answered me with a bad smile on the corner of his mouth. I pinched the flesh on his waist hard at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all your fault!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fake scream of pain reached my ears, and although my mouth was complaining about him, sweetness was spreading inside me. I tried to reach for the clothes next to me, but I felt a wave of dizziness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to touch my forehead, but I felt a vomiting sensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Claudia, you&#39;re not going to get pregnant so soon, are you?&#34; Isaac laughed at this point and I looked at his face once again and couldn&#39;t help but pinch the flesh on his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think so. Maybe it&#39;s something else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at my abdomen at this time, although I was hoping in my heart that there would be a child of ours, but something like getting pregnant right now shouldn&#39;t be possible, the odds of that are too small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was because we were too crazy today and the exhaustion of my body made me feel dizzy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, but I realized that the dizziness didn&#39;t go away, it wasn&#39;t a short-lived dizziness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Claudia, are you feeling okay?&#34; I could feel Isaac&#39;s concern for me as he sat up and took me in his arms from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me to take you to see the doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In that case...I think I can test it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Test for what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Test to see if I&#39;m pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath at this point, and my mind recalled the witch&#39;s book I had once read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a little magic written on it whose only function was to test if one was pregnant, and I couldn&#39;t imagine that I could still remember that magic so clearly now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I subconsciously wanted to have a child a long time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Although I know the probability is very small. But I still look forward to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listened to Isaac&#39;s voice in my ears as I began to carve a magic formation into the earth, and then dropped a drop of my blood into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If the magic formation releases a green glow, then it proves I&#39;m pregnant. If not, then it should be something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both gazed at the pattern of the small magic array. After two seconds had passed, both of our pupils contracted at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because I saw the center of the magic array, a green glow like fireflies at night on top of the earth slowly released, as if life is growing on the earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at those rays and I froze, but the next moment I felt a force throw me down to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re really pregnant! We will have a pup! Thank Moon goddess!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac hugged me excitedly and kissed my cheeks and lips frantically, his excited expression was like a child who had been rewarded. I had hardly ever seen him in such a state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Claudia, congratulations.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole&#39;s voice also appeared inside my head, and I felt my heart filled with surprise and joy at the same time, and I couldn&#39;t even utter a complete sentence for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I dreaming?&#34; I looked at the sea of flowers that seemed like a dream around me, and I looked at my loving mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you are not dreaming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s excitement seemed to stop as he held me in his arms like a princess, spinning with the wind blowing around me, the scent of flowers blowing in the wind into my nostrils, and I felt that, in addition to the fainting inside my head, physically, I was becoming faint as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re...having a pup!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gradually came back to my senses. I grabbed Isaac&#39;s shoulders with my hands and proceeded to shake them hard. I was also infected by his emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did this pup have? Why did we find it today, find it in this beautiful place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the excitement, I sat on Isaac&#39;s lap and we embraced each other in the middle of the tulips and lavender, looking at this beautiful sea of flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe it was sometime before?&#34; Isaac stroked my hair tenderly. &#34;Maybe this pup knows it&#39;s our honeymoon and he wants to surprise us today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listened to his voice and I stroked my belly as I imagined what a cute pup it would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Claudia, it&#39;s almost evening and the pumpkin carriage must be waiting at the entrance to the estate for a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to go back to the hotel so soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, you need to have a good rest now.&#34; Isaac looked at me, the corners of his mouth curled up in a beautiful amplitude, and the smell of ebony and cedar rushed into my nostrils. &#34;Claudia, you don&#39;t know how much I love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know ......&#34; I kissed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at his eyes and I could feel the strong love in his heart.</p>
