                <p>Two years ago</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes. I was shocked by the scene in front of me. Was this heaven? I got up and looked around. This room was lit with incense I had never smelled before. The fragrance did not come from any plants. It made me feel comfortable. I got out of bed and stepped on the ground. The ground was covered with soft animal skin. There was no natural light here. The only light source was the light of the candles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the door was opened and a black-haired woman with purple eyes walked into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are the witch!&#34; I immediately realized that she had once developed my ability to read minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems that you still remember.&#34; The witch told me that her name was Miranda. &#34;I didn&#39;t expect you to appear there, and you were seriously injured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told Miranda what happened to me. Her eyes were full of pity for me. &#34;You should recuperate here first. The witch&#39;s medicine will help you recover faster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the time when I was recovering, Miranda told me a lot about the witches. She brought me here, which was coven, and this was the gathering place of the witches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in fact, witches usually did not interact with each other. Each of them had their own tasks and survival methods. Some powerful witches would help the pack fight, and some choose to go and live in seclusion. But when they came to hurting their common interests, such as hunting witches. The witches would gather together to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met many different witches here, but they were not willing to pay attention to me. Miranda told me that there was actually a war between witches, and they also had conflicts of interest. But life here still made me very happy. This was the best life I had since my parents died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I recovered, Miranda asked me what I was going to do now. My mind was blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter. You can think about it slowly. But I want to tell you that your bloodline is very special. As long as you want to become a powerful witch, you can come to me. I will help you train.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered the quarrel between my mother and my father. They did mention my eyes and my grandmother&#39;s. Was this why they always wanted me to hide my eyes? My grandmother was also a powerful witch, but powerful witches would always be involved in a war or killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I had nothing now, and even my wolf couldn&#39;t appear at any time. I thought of the life of being insulted and scolded in the pack. I had enough of this kind of life. And I didn&#39;t know the truth about my parents&#39; death. If I became a powerful witch, I could help my parents clear their names. So I made up my mind to find Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me seriously. &#34;Training is a very difficult thing. You will be tortured physically and mentally. We can start right away if you can bear it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can endure any pain in order to say goodbye to my miserable life.&#34; I answered firmly without saying anything extra. Miranda nodded and officially brought me into training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the following days, I came into contact with a pain that was totally different than the first half of my life. Learning magic was a test of the mental strength of a witch, so when I was training, it was like countless people were beating my brain and screaming in my ears. I once fell into a breakdown, but the memories of my parents reminded me that only by persisting could I avenge them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent a few months in pain and chaos. When the torture was over, Miranda told me, &#34;You have completed most of the training, and there is still the last step &#39;transformation &#39;. But this last step is also the most critical step. Many witches fail to persist in the end and choose to suicide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had come to this step and could no longer turn back. I said to her, &#34;I am ready. Please start at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Miranda gave me a glass of strange potion and locked me in a closed room. The potion began to take effect soon after. I finally knew why so many witches would choose to suicide. Even though I had suffered so many injuries since I was a child, I had never felt such pain before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hair and toes were in pain. I tore my hair painfully and bit my arm. This pain came from my bone marrow. Every cell in my body was being torn apart. I wanted to cry out, but my throat could not make a sound. I had doubts about Miranda. Did she want to torture me to death?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no idea how long I had been in pain, but that time was very long for me. Then the door was opened, and Miranda helped me up from the ground. &#34;Congratulations on completing your &#39;transformation&#39;. You are a real witch now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held me in front of the mirror. I looked at the person in the mirror. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She had long silver hair to her waist, a graceful figure, and flawless smooth skin. Then I realized that this woman was me. I couldn&#39;t help but cry. I didn&#39;t know if it was because of the torture or the joy of success. I just covered my face and cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda told me that &#39;transformation&#39; was a process of rebirth. The body was so painful because it changed with the ability of the witch. She told me that I could summon my wolf at any time now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately called Nicole&#39;s name in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am here.&#34; When Nicole&#39;s voice appeared, I was very excited. Father, I finally had my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda was very satisfied with my appearance. &#34;I knew you were a powerful witch. I knew it from the moment I saw your eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked her, &#34;Are my eyes special? My grandmother also has such eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have only seen your eyes once. The witch with these eyes helped a king win the war.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow...&#34; I didn&#39;t think I would be that powerful, and now I was satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also asked her a question that had been bothering me. &#34;Aren&#39;t witches all very independent? Why are you helping me?&#34; Although I was very grateful for her teaching me this, I was still very puzzled why she helped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are fewer and fewer powerful witches. This is not a good thing for our whole group. I will try to find some witches with potential.&#34; Miranda said, &#34;You can go anywhere now, but remember to come back when the coven is in danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. Next, I would find a way to find out the truth about the death of my parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two years later</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona cried endlessly because of that slap. Did she think it was over? I had been beaten by her terribly. Now because of the &#39;transformation&#39;, there were no flaws in my body, but it did not mean that I forgot the pain. I would let her pay this pain back.</p>
