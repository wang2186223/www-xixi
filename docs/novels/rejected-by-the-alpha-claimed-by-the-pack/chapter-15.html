                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was about to continue, there was a commotion from outside and my wolf immediately sensed danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck! Who&#39;s interrupting me at a time like this? The passion was interrupted, which eased me out of my feverish state. The heat slowly subsided from me. Claudia also heard someone screaming outside and she pushed me away from her body. She hurried and asked me to see what was going on outside. I could only kiss her hard on the lips before I left her. I told Claudia to close the door as it was dangerous outside. Then I rushed out of the basement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chaos outside was worse than I&#39;d imagined, and the pack was haunted by a heavy smell of blood. There were also the cries of children and the screams of women. I didn&#39;t hesitate to run towards the center of the chaos. It turned out that the surrounding rogues had gathered and sneaked up on our wolf pack while it was dark. The rogues had shifted into wolves, and the leader had already stabbed several of the patrolling warriors with his claws. Just then, I saw Neil ambushing the rogue leader from behind him, and he suddenly attacked, and snapping at the leader&#39;s neck with his sharp teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the leading rogue had anticipated his attack and pinned him to the ground with a claw directly on his snout. Our warriors were all wounded and no one could help Neil. Just as the leader&#39;s claw was about to stab Neil in the chest. I immediately shifted and rushed up. The leader sensed me, but he couldn&#39;t keep up with my speed. I took a bite out of the leader&#39;s right hand and Neil took advantage of the opening to escape our fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Owwwwu...!&#34; Howled the leading rogue in pain, which seemed that he was so enraged by my bite. His subordinates all lunged at me like they were in a frenzy. I side-stepped the claws swinging to the left of my vision, then immediately held the leading rogue&#39;s head down and slammed him to the ground. By the way, I dodged the attack behind me. Their movements were like slow motion to my eyes. I didn&#39;t even have to use my claws and break some rogue&#39;s ribs with a single punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surrounding rogues gradually dared not come forward. &#34;He&#39;s too strong! We can&#39;t even beat him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader roared and ordered two of his men to grab both of my arms. Then he opened his big mouth and aimed his teeth at my neck. I showed my claws and hurt the rogues holding me, then tore into the leader&#39;s old face, which was already covered in scars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tussle, the rogues were knocked to the ground and my vision had been obscured by sticky blood. The fainted leader suddenly got up and bit me on the artery of my right leg. The sharp pain knocked me off balance and made me half kneel. The leader sought this opportunity to kill me. When he stretched his left paw to reach for my heart, I caught it with one hand. &#34;You&#39;re just a pathetic villain who can only sneak attack on me.&#34; I picked him up with one hand and stabbed him through the chest with the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wounded warriors of our pack all expressed their heartfelt appreciation as they all exclaimed, &#34;Isaac&#39;s really a future Alpha!&#34; and &#34;I don&#39;t know who else could lead our pack but Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used a strip of cloth torn from my shirt to stop the bleeding. The bite did go deep enough that I could almost see my own bones. But it was all worth it to save the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father arrived and he asked about the damage to the pack first. Beta told him, &#34;Only a few warriors were wounded because they were found in time. But luckily for your brave boys, the rogues were defeated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father rushed to care about Neil&#39;s injuries and Neil told him, &#34;I&#39;m not hurt, Isaac saved me.&#34; Only then did my father turn his attention to me. He seemed to dislike the wound on my leg and immediately averted his eyes. My father said to Neil, &#34;Thanks to you, my son, you are my pride and joy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, it&#39;s Isaac...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Father interrupted Neil immediately when he heard my name. &#34;The fact that he can be hurt like this means inadequate training.&#34; He didn&#39;t look at me and went on to care about the fighters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My emotions were starting to get out of control because of the pain and the loss of blood. I slapped away the doctor&#39;s hand that was trying to bandage me. At that time, I just wanted to grab my father by the collar and ask him, &#34;What&#39;s wrong with me and why don&#39;t you ever like me? Bastard!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t, and that made me vulnerable. All I wanted at that point was to go back to Claudia and rest in her gentle scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac told me to hide in the house and not go out, and all I could do was pray for his safety. But after a while, my leg throbbed with pain. It was only for a moment, but I immediately thought of Isaac, and my instincts told me that he was seriously injured. I walked back and forth through the house. The anxiety in my heart was killing me, and all I could see when I closed my eyes was Isaac falling in a pool of blood. I couldn&#39;t just stay inside the basement anymore. I walked outside and looked around for Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of finding Isaac, I ran into a trapped Fiona, who was barricaded in a corner by a lone rogue. The rogue was looking at her with lust in his eyes. &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to put up a fight before I turn you over to our leader?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona didn&#39;t have her usual swagger at all. She was capable of turning into a wolf, but she had never been in training. Probably every time she went to the training grounds, she did it to drool over Isaac&#39;s abs. Fiona didn&#39;t stand a chance against a rogue who survived in the wild. She knew this very well, so she turned the spearhead on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s wolf must have smelled me as she spoke to the rogue, &#34;There&#39;s a girl hiding behind the door, and she has very creepy good-looking eyes. I&#39;m sure your leader will be very interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to run away immediately, but the rogue was too fast and he grabbed me in one hand. The rogue pulled my hair up and forced me to look him straight in the eyes. I instantly read his mind, &#34;What pretty eyes indeed. Our leader must like them&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona planned to run away as the rogue looked at me, but the rogue reacted quickly. He grabbed Fiona with his other hand. &#34;Don&#39;t treat me as a fool, now that I have something I can submit. There will be no need for you.&#34; The rogue raised his claws, intending to kill Fiona.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona used her wolf&#39;s nimble reaction ability to keep me in front of the rogue&#39;s claws in order to save her life. The next second, the rogue&#39;s claws pierced right through my abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rogue probably didn&#39;t expect that anyone in the pack would betray their companions so outright. &#34;She&#39;s dead, so it&#39;s your turn to come with me.&#34; He pulled Fiona away. I lay in place, and I could clearly feel my blood pouring continually out of the ragged hole in my abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thing I felt was the pain of my internal organs being torn apart, and physical tears welled up in my eyes. Then I felt the coldness from the loss of blood, and my visions began to blacken. &#34;I&#39;m really going to die this time&#34;, I thought. What a pity I would never see Isaac again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a voice pulled my consciousness back from the endless darkness. &#34;Hold on, don&#39;t fall asleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cold body gradually began to warm up, and my wounds were healing. The voice told me, &#34;Don&#39;t fall asleep, I&#39;ll always be here with you. I&#39;m your wolf - Nicole.&#34;</p>
