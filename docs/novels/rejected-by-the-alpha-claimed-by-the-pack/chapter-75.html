                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;High witchcraft is actually this profound.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was my first day of learning higher witchcraft, and on the practice square, as I simply flipped through each of the witchcraft books that contained higher witchcraft, my eyes were almost completely captivated by the contents inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These eleven witchcraft books contained eleven types of witchcraft such as fire witchcraft, plant witchcraft, water witchcraft, space witchcraft, etc. These witchcraft books recorded the usage of witchcraft and spells, but did not record the effects of using these witchcraft, but this instead made me look forward to it even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;As long as I can learn these spells, I will be able to show the power of higher witchcraft.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was looking forward to it in my heart, but after reading for just a while, my brow furrowed as I realized that the complexity of these spells was far from the ones I had learned in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most ordinary witchcraft require some spell formation or a simple incantation, but most of these high witchcraft require a very complex incantation or a combination of incantation and spell formation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the Flame Star that Miranda cast, the length of the incantation was almost three times longer than a normal fireball spell. And the complexity of each syllable was far more than that of an ordinary fireball spell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Nicole, can you read these incantations?&amp;quot; I had some curiosity to ask my wolf, but all I heard was a dull tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I&#39;m not interested in these spells, and I can&#39;t read them.&amp;quot; After saying that Nicole returned to my mind, she seemed bored with the spells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew she didn&#39;t like the witch stuff much, but now that it was the only way I could get stronger, I had no other choice but to try to comfort Nicole while I rested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Now let me try the power of high witchcraft.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the first page of the high witchcraft book, which contained the second level of fireball spell. The power of this fireball spell was not as powerful as the flaming star cast by Miranda, but it was still much stronger than an ordinary fireball spell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I silently memorized the incantation in my mind, looking at the empty space where there was nothing, and at this moment I concentrated my mind and then recited the incantation as fast as I could, but what I didn&#39;t expect was that only a few sparks appeared in the air, and then nothing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did it fail on the first try?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart seemed to be filled with stones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would I really be able to finish learning these eleven books of higher witchcraft? I had some doubts in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed that my expression was noticed by Miranda, and I heard her voice at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, a few of your syllables were recited incorrectly, one place was even mispronounced, and you also had some problems with the use of your own energy.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s gentle voice came from next to me, she was obviously instructing me on the mistakes in the spell, but her voice made me feel like I was soaking in warm water, which made me take my learning of the spell more seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My spell became more proficient under her guidance, and I was immersed in the world of witchcraft until the sky grew dim and I realized that the grass in front of me had been burned to a dim yellow by my flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second level of fireball magic I was almost mastered, joy just appeared in my heart, but in the next moment it was cold again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was only a second level fireball spell, the witchcraft behind it was far more complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to my current speed, I didn&#39;t know how long it would take to learn just this one flame witchcraft book, and I hardly dared to imagine the other witchcraft books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, I can feel your mood, but don&#39;t be impatient, I gave you these witchcraft books not to let you learn all of them.&amp;quot; Miranda smiled and pointed to the eleven witchcraft books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;In fact, many witches only need to be proficient in a certain kind of witchcraft, and she can already be called a powerful witch, like the ten most powerful witches in our coven, who are famous for being proficient in ten different kinds of witchcraft.&amp;quot; After saying that, I suddenly saw a clear stream of water appear in the palm of Miranda&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I am proficient in flame witchcraft, and although I know other witchcraft, none of them have reached the level of flame witchcraft. You only need to look for the witchcraft that best suits you and that you are most suitable for using in your future studies, and then you can study this witchcraft seriously.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The most suitable witchcraft?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, the spell of each different witchcraft, the way it is pronounced is different, for example, the high flame, the gentle plant, the difference between them can be very big, so the witchcraft that suits you is very important.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda slowly stated in my ear, she was like an elder who knew everything to instill what she knew, patiently into my mind, and I understood more about witchcraft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were three classes of witchcraft, ordinary witchcraft, high witchcraft and super witchcraft. The legendary super witchcraft had unimaginable power, but this kind of witchcraft was very rare, and those who had it would not let it spread to the outside world, so the average witchcraft book could only record high witchcraft at most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even if it&#39;s higher witchcraft, it&#39;s still witchcraft that only powerful witches could master.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It seems that you have finished your study for today.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was pondering, I suddenly heard a voice from afar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice, which seemed to be recalled inside my soul, instantly made all the fatigue I had felt throughout the day disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Isaac!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly turned my head and I saw the tall body that was walking in from outside the training ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s body was still wearing a well-fitting combat uniform, and his clothes were covered with a lot of dust, looking like he had just gone through training, but the dust did nothing to hide his charm, which made me jump into his arms uncontrollably and quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, I&#39;m sweating a lot right now, I&#39;ll get you dirty too.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;It doesn&#39;t matter; I will take a shower later.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rubbed my hair hard against his chest. Although he was the first to be by my side after each day&#39;s work, it was hard to feel the miss of him burning in my heart like a fire after just half a day&#39;s absence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, I saw some smiles on Miranda&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;So it&#39;s Isaac back, then I&#39;ll leave you guys alone, Claudia, you go back and get some rest, tomorrow&#39;s training won&#39;t be any easier than today.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her eyes as if she knew everything, some heat appeared on my cheeks, but the next moment I didn&#39;t think much more about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the teacher who brought me up the path of a witch, my sister, and she couldn&#39;t possibly have any thoughts against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I thought of this, I suddenly felt the soles of my feet stepping into the air, and my world spinning with it, the enchanting scent almost filling my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave a startled cry at that moment. &amp;quot;Isaac what are you doing?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot; Of course I&#39;m carrying you back to packhouse, you&#39;ve been training all day and I can&#39;t afford to overwhelm you and our child.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking of which, I saw the corners of his mouth curl up in a curve. &amp;quot;And didn&#39;t you just say that you don&#39;t mind the dust on me?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his words, my breathing became a little sharper, and then I buried my cheek tightly inside his chest, an action that perfectly blocked my expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light of the setting sun shone from ahead on our way back to packhouse, and I slept in his arms as my mind began to recall what I had learned today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How much I wanted to help Isaac, but at the rate I was learning, would I really be able to become a powerful witch?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda wouldn&#39;t lie to me, a witch with my pupils had great potential, but at this rate of learning, I couldn&#39;t imagine how I would be able to have the power to help a kingdom win a war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where exactly was the power of these pupils hidden?</p>
