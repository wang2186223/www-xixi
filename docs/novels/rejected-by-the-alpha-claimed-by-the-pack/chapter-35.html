                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat frozen in front of the mirror and tried to empty my mind. Even if not as a slave, life here was not easy. Today I had a hard time sending Toby away and was finally able to enjoy some peace and quiet. Toby was good, he was like a little dancing flame. It&#39;s always a pleasure to have someone like that around. But my heart had closed up and I couldn&#39;t accept his affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though more than a year had passed, I still looked at my face in a trance. I rolled up my long silver hair and prepared to take a bath. When I wrapped myself in a bath towel, there was a rapid knock on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the door and saw Isaac&#39;s face. Without any hesitation, I slammed the door in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac reacted quickly and grabbed the door frame. &#34;Let me in. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he just say&#34; please &#34;to me? I had never heard this word from him. However, there was something wrong with Isaac today. The dangerous aura on his body was restrained a lot. His good-looking eyebrows wrinkled, and his eyes were full of lingering melancholy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not intend to compete with him in strength. I let him in. Unexpectedly, as soon as I turned around, Isaac hugged me from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; I tried to break away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just let me hug you for a while, okay?&#34; His two strong arms locked me in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit his hand hard with my teeth before he let me go. I regretted that I shouldn&#39;t have let him in from the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out.&#34; I pointed at the door. How dare he do this to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be so cold to me. You will smile at Toby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am cold to you? Do you remember how you treated me two years ago?&#34; I looked at him. &#34;Let me remind you, you f*ck with Fiona in front of me!&#34; My voice trembled when I said this. I did not know whether I was angry or sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the past two years, I had been telling myself that I had forgotten everything about the past. After the test of life and death, I had trained myself to be an emotionless person, including this time when I came back. I didn&#39;t want to have any more entanglement with Isaac, but I didn&#39;t expect that after two years, I would still have a breakdown when I saw him. My heart had always been naked in front of him. He could use a dagger to scratch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was a mistake!&#34; Isaac raised his voice. &#34;I never thought of hurting you. It was all a play.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to hear his voice or see him. &#34;Do you think I will still be like how I was two years ago, fooled by you like a fool?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please believe me. Everything I did was to protect you.&#34; Isaac held my shoulder and looked at me sincerely. I read his thoughts. He was indeed telling the truth. &#34;I had never liked other women. When I hugged Fiona, I only felt disgusted. But I did all this to deceive other people. I could not let Luna know that I loved you. Otherwise, you would be killed by her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if what you said was the truth, it could not save me from harm.&#34; He said that he loved me, and my breathing stopped for a second. Two years ago, did he love me? I saw the silver ring in his hand. It was a relic that I had given him! I did not expect him to always wear this ring. It was my most precious thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I don&#39;t beg for your forgiveness. I just hope you don&#39;t leave me again.&#34; Isaac hugged my waist and kissed my side face. &#34;I have been looking for you for two years, but there is no trace of you. So when I saw you again, I felt it was the answer to my prayers from the Moon Goddess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s deep voice hit my eardrums, and I couldn&#39;t push him away. He held me in his arms with both hands, then lowered his head, and our lips got closer and closer. Isaac pushed my teeth away. I retreated because of his fierce attack until he pressed me against the wall. My thoughts were in chaos. I saw Isaac&#39;s eyes slowly turn red. His wolf was fighting with him for control. His hand reached into my bathrobe. Enough, it shouldn&#39;t be like this. I bit down hard on Isaac&#39;s tongue. When he let go of me, his thin lips were stained with a dazzling bright red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are just strangers now. Don&#39;t do this again in the future.&#34; I warned Isaac. His eyes finally became the golden brown color I was familiar with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked at me with disappointment. I avoided his eyes. Even if no one was wrong at that time. We had loved each other, but that was only the past. Now we had all changed. I knew he was telling the truth, but I would no longer trust him. Our relationship was like a broken porcelain plate. Even if it was repaired, the crack would always be there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac wiped the blood off his lips with his thumb. &#34;I won&#39;t force you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, leave.&#34; I needed to be alone now to deal with the tension he brought me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I drove Isaac away, a sense of emptiness instantly surged into my heart. Nicole howled in my mind with dissatisfaction. I didn&#39;t know why, but I could also feel Caesar&#39;s restlessness. There was always a connection between us. Even after dissolved the relationship, I grabbed my wrist until my nails pierced my skin. Didn&#39;t think about him. We had no relationship for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stranger? I grabbed my hair. How could I treat Claudia as a stranger? Even with this brief contact just now, I could calm down by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but kiss her by her side. It might be too much for her, but I was not satisfied. Caesar wanted to pounce on her just now. I could only lock him back to the depths of my consciousness. Now he could come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should stay there!&#34; Caesar roared. He was very dissatisfied with my way of handling things about Claudia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hurt her too much. She needs time to recover.&#34; I pressed my chest. It was full of anxiety and uneasiness. But now we still had time.</p>
