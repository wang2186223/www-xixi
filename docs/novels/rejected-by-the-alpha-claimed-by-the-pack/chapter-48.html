                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The alarm clock on the bedside rang for a long time. My head was about to explode. I reached out to press the alarm clock, but Isaac was faster than me. He took the alarm clock and smashed it against the wall. &#34;Boom!&#34; The room immediately quieted down. I couldn&#39;t blame him for his bad temper. His head should be more painful than mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, we drank up all the stock at home. We said we just need a glass of red wine to help us sleep. I didn&#39;t know who suggested playing a small game. Moreover, Isaac and I were people who were unwilling to admit defeat. In fact, it was a draw. But I used magic to cheat a few times when my tongue could still chant a spell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I endured the headache and looked at the calendar. Then I struggled to get up from the bed. Isaac pulled me back to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; he asked me with his eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Toby is coming today. I&#39;ll pick him up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh god!&#34; Isaac rubbed his temples. &#34;Him again? Why can&#39;t he just get out of my life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t say that. He&#39;s your younger brother.&#34; I piled the quilt on Isaac and walked to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;F*ck... Can you ask him to leave?&#34; Isaac made a dull sound in the quilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, if you don&#39;t want me to meet Toby alone, I advise you to go with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac finally sat up from the quilt. &#34;You are a devil.&#34; He came out of bed wearing only a black flat boxer shorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Isaac in the mirror. How could he look like a model after a hangover? I combed my long hair that was tied together because of rolling on the bed and thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hugged me from behind, looking like he couldn&#39;t sleep. I could only urge him&#34; Go and take a shower. You smelled of alcohol.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you too. Do you want to join me?&#34; His hand restlessly touched me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out. We have no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One day you will be punished for talking to me like that.&#34; Isaac walked into the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so scared.&#34; I shrank my neck expressionlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You definitely will.&#34; Isaac poked his head out of the bathroom and said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I came out of the bathroom, Isaac had already made breakfast. Actually, according to the time, it should be lunch. This may be the only benefit of living with him. I don&#39;t have to step into the annoying kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t expect that Neil would invite Toby to his coronation ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He knew that he couldn&#39;t beat White Claw pack, so he chose to continue to negotiate with them. And with you here, Toby will come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope he won&#39;t be like Andre.&#34; I remembered the times when Andre tried to harm us with the means of negotiation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t dare. Neil doesn&#39;t have the power. The commanders will watch him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you be sad when it comes to the ceremony? I remember that you really wanted to be Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I was young, I wanted to use this to gain the approval of others, because I was not strong enough at that time. But after facing death and despair, it doesn&#39;t matter anymore. I just want to get what I love the most.&#34; He smiled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But still I was a little sad.&#34; Neil is our Alpha. &#34;It is so embarrassing to say it. I never saw that he had this ambition. Who knows why he wanted to be Alpha so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, I could see from Neil&#39;s eyes that he had always been jealous of Isaac. Perhaps in his eyes, becoming Alpha was the only way to prove to others that he was stronger than Isaac. But I couldn&#39;t tell Isaac that this was between the two of them, and I couldn&#39;t interfere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and I waited for Toby at the door of pack. He was a little darker, and his skin was a beautiful wheat color under the sun. The moment he saw Isaac, the smile on his face collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is he doing here?&#34; Toby pointed at Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He came with me to pick you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t believe it.&#34; Toby sniffed the air. &#34;Why has your smell changed? Wait, have you been marked by him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I subconsciously touched the mark on the back of my neck. &#34;Is this obvious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby looked very angry. He clenched his fists. I used my elbow to pound Isaac and let him put away the flaunting expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to punch Isaac&#39;s smug face. Claudia was surrounded by his smell. All kinds of complicated emotions were intertwined in my heart. I was very angry that he dared to casually mark Claudia. But they were mate. Thinking of this, my heart ached again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Andre was exiled, I returned to White Claw pack. Claudia still stayed in Crimson Shadow pack. I knew that she wanted to accompany her mate. I could feel the change in her attitude towards Isaac after she re-established her relationship with Isaac. Although it was difficult for her to notice it herself, I could tell from the way she looked at Isaac that she still loved him. Claudia finally opened her closed heart, but I couldn&#39;t be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t bless her because I liked her from the first time I saw Claudia. It was the same now. Her beautiful green eyes looked at me, full of worry. I didn&#39;t want her to be sad, so I put away my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil made this coronation ceremony like a ball. He even let the people attending the ceremony wear dresses to enter, but it was a good idea. He let me see Claudia wearing a dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia wore a champagne-colored dress, and the &#34;V&#34; shape of the dress revealed her beautiful back. The slit on the side of the dress made her slender legs faintly discernible in the silk fabric. Her silvery-white long hair was curved to a wave, shining like the river under the moonlight. She was so beautiful today that I almost ignored Isaac beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Isaac was too outstanding. His expressionless face was like a statue, and his eyes were cold. Only when he looked at Claudia did his expression become gentler. I didn&#39;t know why all the women present were looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look very handsome today,&#34; Claudia said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m very happy to hear you praise me, but can you not look at me like that? This is the look of an elder.&#34; I hate Claudia treating me like a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god, am I like this?&#34; Claudia&#39;s ears turned red. She was really cute at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move your eyes away from my mate.&#34; Isaac stared at me and said in my mind. I really miss the time when he did not know how to use mind link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Being polite means when talking to someone, you have to look at them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Being polite means to stay away from other people&#39;s mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia glanced at Isaac and then looked at me. &#34;What are you whispering in the mind link?&#34; She was really damn sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pretended not to hear her and turned his head to the other direction. I smiled and said to Claudia, &#34;It&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, all the lights in the hall turned down. A strong white light hit the rotating stairs on the left side of the auditorium. Neil slowly walked down from stairs with a glass of wine. Oh my god, did he think he was a Princess on her 16th birthday?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked to the standing microphone under the stairs. &#34;Thank you for coming to my coronation ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t remember what Neil said after that. It was just some boring nonsense. Just when everyone was sleepy, he suddenly changed the topic to Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The person I am most grateful to is my elder brother, Isaac. Without his support, I can&#39;t become Alpha at all.&#34; Neil motioned for Isaac to stand beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia held Isaac&#39;s hand in panic. Isaac smiled at her. &#34;It&#39;s okay.&#34; Then he let go of Claudia&#39;s hand and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Protect her,&#34; Isaac said to me through the mind link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac walked to Neil. Neil intimately put his arm around Isaac&#39;s shoulder and said, &#34;I hope Isaac can accept it and become our pack&#39;s Beta.&#34;</p>
