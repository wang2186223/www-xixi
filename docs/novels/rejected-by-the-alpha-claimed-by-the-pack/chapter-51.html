                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brought Toby to the hospital. pack&#39;s doctor took Toby&#39;s blood for a check-up. He told us that the poison in Toby was a well-known forbidden medicine in the pack. It was a medicine that could cause wolf heat. Medicine usually circulated in the black market. Normal people would not be able to get it. Toby was left in the ward for observation by the doctor. He also needed to remove the poison in his blood through the infusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I accompanied Toby by his bedside. He kept asking me who drugged him. I could not tell him now. I had no evidence to prove that this was Neil&#39;s doing. I had to meet Neil personally. I was still thinking about how to deal with Neil. The bigger trouble was coming soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac rushed in from outside the ward. He smelled the air and then pulled Toby out of bed. &#34;What did you do to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Toby was strangled by the collar and could not speak. I wanted to break Isaac&#39;s hand. &#34;Let go of him. He has nothing to do with this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your body is full of his smell!&#34; Isaac roared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t do anything to me! He is also a victim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A victim?&#34; Isaac slowly loosened Toby&#39;s collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, someone drugged me, but Toby drank it.&#34; I continued, &#34;His wolf was out of control. We fought, but he couldn&#39;t hurt me.&#34; I didn&#39;t dare to tell Isaac that Akio wanted to rape me. That way, he would beat him up regardless of whether Toby was a victim or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac let go of Toby. &#34;Who wants to drug you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know if it was a good idea to tell Isaac about this. He was already unstable. Isaac saw my hesitation and pulled me out of the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t speak, I know who you are suspicious of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and I swore to each other that we must be honest with each other. But I was afraid that he would lose control. After all, Neil had once kidnapped me. Isaac&#39;s patience for Neil had reached its limit. &#34;I can tell you, but you have to promise me that you won&#39;t be impulsive. You have to listen to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I promise you,&#34; Isaac said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suspect that Neil drugged me, but I don&#39;t have any evidence yet. I want to confront him face to face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This bastard.&#34; Isaac clenched his fists. The killing intent from his body made my palms sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down. I can&#39;t be sure that it&#39;s him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to confront him? I&#39;ll go with you.&#34; I knew he was going to say that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I promised him. &#34;But you can&#39;t be impulsive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I entrusted Toby to the doctor. He promised me to stay in the hospital. When it was dark, Isaac and I left the hospital. In order to prevent Neil from escaping halfway, we sneaked into Neil&#39;s room to wait for him. When the light in the room lit up, Neil saw us and was shocked. He subconsciously wanted to run. Isaac was faster than him. He blocked the door in front of Neil and locked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you going to do?&#34; Neil asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what you did.&#34; I looked into Neil&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[How did she know? Did she see through my disguise? ] Neil&#39;s inner thoughts had already exposed him, but he still pretended not to know anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did I do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did you put in my wine when you pretended to be a waiter in the bar that day?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What bar? I don&#39;t understand what you are talking about. &#39;He was still resisting. I nodded to Isaac. He immediately understood what I meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac knocked Neil to the ground with a punch. He bent Neil&#39;s arm in a strange arc with anti-joint capture. Although this was Isaac&#39;s most gentle method, Neil&#39;s face was still red because of the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said I don&#39;t know!&#34; Neil continued to resist. I squatted down and looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>[This damned Isaac. If I tell the truth, it won&#39;t be a problem of losing an arm. ] I had to say that he guessed correctly, especially with Isaac&#39;s current state. I couldn&#39;t guarantee that I could control Isaac. But Neil went too far, and we had to use this tactic to deal with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am very curious how you got the forbidden medicine. Will Alpha still go to the black market on his own?&#34; I gave Isaac a meaningful look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was exerting his strength, and I could hear the sound of Neil&#39;s bones breaking. Neil&#39;s face was twisted because of the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you tell the truth now, I will let you go. If you don&#39;t say it, wait for me to break all the bones in your body,&#34; Isaac said to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two terrorists! I am your Alpha!&#34; Neil shouted, but Isaac did not care about Neil. He continued to move his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; Neil finally screamed. &#34;You damn bastard s! I put the medicine on you. Are you satisfied?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac finally let go of his arm. &#34;Where did the medicine come from?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bought it from rouge outside.&#34; Neil held his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His answer surprised me. &#34;You actually made a deal with rouge? Do you still remember that your identity is Alpha?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahahaha!&#34; Neil laughed as if he had heard the biggest joke in the world. &#34;Only I remember that my identity is Alpha, you!&#34; He pointed at me and Isaac. &#34;When did you treat me as Alpha, including pack&#39;s people? Do they think I can&#39;t see their disdainful eyes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You kidnapped Claudia for this damn position.&#34; Isaac pinched Neil&#39;s broken arm. &#34;You should have known that no one wanted you to be Alpha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neil said to Isaac, &#34;You madman, I should have killed you first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac sneered, &#34;Why do you think you can kill me? Even Andre can&#39;t do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I am pack&#39;s Alpha. It is all because of you that pack&#39;s people look down on me! You are inferior to me and you should kneel under my feet.&#34; Neil shouted. I felt that he was jealous of Isaac to the point of insanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are just like Andre now, making me sick. Do you want to hear the truth? Your Alpha status is a handout from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! This is not true!&#34; Neil shook his head and wanted to deny this fact. &#34;I tell you what is true. The medicine was placed by me because I want to fuck her. I want to fuck your mate, I want her to be my Luna!&#34; I wanted to stop Neil from saying this, but it was too late. He completely angered Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyes were red. He punched Neil in the face. Neil knelt on the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood. I was afraid that if he really killed Neil, his mother would be sad. I pulled Isaac. &#34;Think about your mother. Neil is also her child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac slowed down, but Neil turned into a wolf and bit Isaac&#39;s leg. Isaac&#39;s eyes turned red and he pushed me away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caesar! Don&#39;t kill him!&#34; But Caesar lost his mind like that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caesar did not turn into a wolf at all. He grabbed Neil&#39;s mouth, and Neil&#39;s teeth pierced his palm. However, Caesar did not even blink. He used his two hands to open Neil&#39;s mouth. The wolf&#39;s greatest strength was its bite force, but Caesar easily opened Neil&#39;s mouth. I could not imagine his strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until I heard a &#34;crack&#34; sound. Neil&#39;s jaw had been broken. His big mouth could no longer be closed. Caesar took out a short knife from behind his waist. His hands quickly healed. I could see his wound closed. Caesar held the short knife and was about to stab it into Neil&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; A familiar woman&#39;s voice came from the door.</p>
