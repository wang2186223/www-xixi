                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A month passed quickly, and under Miranda&#39;s tutelage, I followed the eleven books of higher witchcraft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During this time, I also found the most suitable witchcraft for me, natural witchcraft, but the doubts in my mind were getting heavier and heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used almost all my strength to learn this book of natural witchcraft, but I spent a month to learn only one tenth of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I were to finish learning all the higher witchcraft in the book of natural witchcraft, I could hardly imagine how much time I would have to spend, because the further I got into this book, the more powerful and complex the higher witchcraft recorded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, according to Miranda, the eleven books of witchcraft that she possessed were only the ones that she had, and all of the higher natural witchcraft was far more than what was written in the book that she brought with her, there were more witchcraft written in other witchcraft books, and to become a powerful natural witch, just learning this book was not enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is it true that this kind of study has no way to stimulate the power of my bloodline?&amp;quot; Standing on the training ground in the early morning, I looked at the tree that was blackened by Miranda&#39;s flame and fell into distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was now completely sure that no matter how much I studied witchcraft, even if I learned all the higher witchcraft of natural witchcraft, there was no way for me to gain the power to help a kingdom win a war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the green book of higher witchcraft and began to ponder. I did have a little more ability to defend myself now compared to before, but this strength was still far from being able to help Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What exactly do I have to do to stimulate the power of my eyes?&amp;quot; My distress became more and more serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The early morning sunlight shone on my body, and I sat helplessly on the empty ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda was not in the pack right now, because an important witchcraft book had been stolen from the coven, so she had to go back and meet with the other witches in the coven, and Isaac was also training for the army, but I didn&#39;t really want to continue practicing witchcraft today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted power, I wanted to protect my children, I wanted to stand with Isaac on the same level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pondered bitterly, but I couldn&#39;t figure out what I was going to do to bring out the power in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed slowly, the sun gradually baked my body, but I gradually became desperate, because even Miranda, who had a wealth of knowledge, was not sure how to stimulate the power of my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was thinking here; could I really figure it out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feeling of powerlessness seemed like a pair of struggling hands were grabbing my heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just at that moment, I heard a voice inside my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, I feel your desire, after all this time, I have also figured out that there is no right or wrong power, as long as it is used in the right way, what kind of power is worth having.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicole&#39;s voice paused here for a moment, and then she increased her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, I think you are caught in the swamp of thought, maybe we should think a little simpler, the eyes and you can change into a wolf, is the same as the power passed down inside our blood, want to activate this power, maybe we should not think about that some complicated things, maybe just rely on our own power can bring it out. &amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;By our own power?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to Miranda&#39;s voice, I suddenly felt as if a bright path had appeared inside my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Yes, it is our own power, the power has always been inside me, I should believe in myself, believe that I can also have great power.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes became firm in this moment, then I closed my eyes and felt the blood flowing inside my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking back carefully, when my bloodline was initially stimulated, the first ability I gained was the ability to see through other people&#39;s minds, then slowly developed to have the ability to influence other people&#39;s minds, perhaps my power was hidden within this ability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The power of the mind ......&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I silently recited these words, and suddenly, it seemed like a thunderbolt flashed inside my head, and then my eyes snapped open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I understand, my power must be hidden inside this ability to influence the mind, maybe believe in miracles, miracles will become us itself!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I instantly opened the witchcraft book that recorded natural witchcraft at this time, and on the first page was recorded an offensive vine manipulation witchcraft, and its incantation was the simplest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unleash your power, my heart, my blood!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mumbled in my mind, then quickly let the witchcraft I was able to affect the mind run through my mind, allowing this power to combine with the incantation in the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to recite the spell of vine manipulation witchcraft in my inner mind through the power of psychic witchcraft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment a miracle happened, I could feel the complex incantation rapidly running through my mind, and when I recited it using my mind witchcraft, the incantation was recited in my mind almost too fast for me to imagine!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In less than a second, a green vine grew rapidly in the ground in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the golden sunlight, the bright green vine looked full of life, and in this open ground, next to the burnt tree, this vine was as beautiful as a miracle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So fast, was this the true power contained in my bloodline?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes wide in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although I had learned the vine manipulation witchcraft, if I recited it with my voice, it would take me at least three seconds or even longer, but when I used my mind, it barely took me even a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such power was really too scary, and I felt my body tremble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to the general knowledge of witches, the greatest weakness of witches was that it took time to use witchcraft, and the more powerful the witchcraft, the longer it took, but if I used the power of the mind to initiate witchcraft, it almost completely eliminated this weakness of witches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s hard to imagine how powerful a witch who could start a witchcraft in an instant would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could expect that when I fought with other witches, I would have attacked while the other witches were still chanting their spells, which was unthinkable for other witches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly flipped through the pages of my natural witchcraft book and soon I saw a new witchcraft that I had not yet learned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This witchcraft was a rather complicated one, and I would have needed some time to recite the incantation correctly, but instead I started trying to use the power of my mind directly this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What will be the surprise this time?&amp;quot; I felt my heart in anticipation, but in the very next moment, my eyes widened once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ability wasn&#39;t just as simple as being able to unleash witchcraft quickly, it was even more powerful and terrifying than I had imagined!</p>
