                <p>&amp;quot;Lux, is it true what you said, that Blood Moon Pack destroyed another pack and then has declared war on White Claw Pack?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Of course it&#39;s true, Blood Moon Pack keeps on waging war and has some oddly powerful strength.&amp;quot; Lux&#39;s voice became gruff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Under my investigation for such a long time, I found out that the reason is that their Alpha, Alpha Jack&#39;s strength far exceeds the other werewolves, and there is also an evil wizard in Blood Moon Pack who uses dark witchcraft!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Lux&#39;s words, my brow furrowed tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>White Claw Pack was our Crimson Shadow Pack ally, Toby was also Claudia&#39;s friend, I couldn&#39;t help them, it seemed I had to speed up the preparation for the war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flashed determination and bloodlust inside my eyes at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter who it was, anyone who was a threat to my pack and to Claudia, I would completely solve it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I thought of this, I heard a noise coming from outside the command hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Is something happening outside?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Maybe it&#39;s a duel between our warriors.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lux didn&#39;t seem very interested, but I could feel my heart beating a little faster, and I couldn&#39;t ignore such a feeling, so I quickly walked out of the command hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voices seemed to be focused on the northern part of the training ground, and they seemed to be watching something, and I looked to a soldier who was walking next to me at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Do you know what&#39;s going on there?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This warrior immediately became respectful upon seeing me. &amp;quot;Alpha Isaac, that was a duel between Luna Claudia and the third squad leader, Reyn, but the winner should have been decided by now, and the third squad leader was defeated by Luna Claudia.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;The third squad leader was defeated by Claudia?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hardly believe my ears when I heard this warrior&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Say that again, are you sure you&#39;re right?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Of course it&#39;s right, Luna Claudia is very strong, the third squad leader fought with her for a long time, but in the end, he lost.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to this warrior&#39;s words, I was also very surprised, but soon I suddenly laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia was pregnant, even if she had learned some witchcraft, it was impossible to defeat the third squad leader, which must be because the third squad leader did not use his real strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia, after all, was Crimson Shadow Pack&#39;s Luna, and now that she was still pregnant, no one dared to hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this I quickly walked towards the north.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if it&#39;s because the third squad leader didn&#39;t go all out. Claudia should have become much stronger after learning witchcraft for so long, which made me feel happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would be unhappy because their lover became better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps it was because I was eager to see Claudia. Soon, I had arrived at the northern part of the training ground, and the figure that I had missed had appeared in my sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed to be in good condition, and her bright and beautiful green eyes already made me feel fascinated from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t hold back and came to her side and then took her in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You&#39;re really good Claudia, I heard that you defeated the captain of the third squad.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stroked her soft hair, she looked exhausted, which made me feel some heartache, I gently asked her a few questions, and then I carried her towards the villa location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I got to the villa, I found that she had fallen asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her sleeping face, I was a little worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already more than three months pregnant, and she was forbidden to engage in such battles in the future. After she woke up, I had to seriously talk to her about this matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this my movements became faster, I put her on the bed of the villa then I lay beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gently held her in my arms and stroked her belly with my hand, which had a little amplitude, and there was our child inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really didn&#39;t know what this child would be like in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I thought of this, the werewolves in White Pack who wanted to hurt Claudia reappeared in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Blood Moon Pack!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This pack was likely going to be more powerful than I thought, but I would never let them hurt Claudia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Claudia&#39;s face, my eyes became more determined, and then I had some reluctance to get up from the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our war with Blood Moon Pack was getting close, and I had to grab every second now to be ready to absolutely win, and with that thought I left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudia&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Claudia, that wizard is a great threat to the coven, I must leave now, there is almost nothing left for me to guide you now, if there is anything you can contact me.&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving these last words, Miranda left from Crimson Shadow Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind recalled her careful instruction to me, and a feeling of reluctance arose in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Black Witchcraft for wizards ......&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know why, but I suddenly remembered the wizard I met at the White Pack, who was also a wizard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I quickly shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wizard at the White Pack used prophetic witchcraft to help so many people, and I didn&#39;t detect anything wrong with him, so he shouldn&#39;t be an evil black wizard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that in mind, I turned my attention to the many witchcraft books I still had in my hands that I hadn&#39;t studied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the time before my child was born, I would use all my energy to learn the witchcraft above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made this decision in my mind and started to execute it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The time I spent studying was hardly boring, because the power of my mind made me feel not only relaxed, but also addicted to the feeling of getting stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In addition to precognition witchcraft, other witchcraft books I also carried out some simple study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was by my side all the time, and although he seemed to be a little busy with the Blood Moon Pack, his concern with all his might made me feel even warmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seasons were changing with time, and when the beginning of the second year, I could feel the size of my belly getting bigger, and my wolf was getting a little restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that my child would soon be born, and perhaps I should tell Isaac the news so that he could join me in witnessing the birth of our child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this thought, I started to call the servant at the door, but when the servant came to me, I heard some low voice from her. &amp;quot;Alpha Isaac is no longer in Crimson Shadow Pack, because Blood Moon Pack started the war, Blood Moon Pack&#39;s Alpha is somehow much stronger, just by their Alpha alone is enough to withstand many of our warriors. &amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listened to her voice, which almost made me feel incredulous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Are we already at war with Blood Moon Pack?!&amp;quot; My hands began to tremble a little. &amp;quot;Why does Blood Moon Pack keep waging war?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the year, I had been keeping healthy because of the baby in my belly, but I knew something about Blood Moon Pack, but I hadn&#39;t been thinking carefully about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after I heard Blood Moon Pack Alpha strength became stronger, I seemed to remember something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Blood Moon Pack, Blood Moon, is it because ......&amp;quot; My face turned gradually became grave, because I remembered the ancient werewolf bloodline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During this year of witchcraft study, I gained more knowledge of witchcraft and more understanding of some ancient records.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the records, the bloodline of these ancient werewolves would be activated under the bloody full moon, and their power would be greatly increased. In addition, whenever they killed a werewolf who was also of the ancient werewolf bloodline, their own bloodline would become purer and their own power would become more powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only that, even if the kill was not an ancient werewolf, if the mass slaughter of ordinary werewolves, after the collection of werewolf blood and souls to a certain extent, their strength would also be enhanced to some extent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;I understand the reason why Blood Moon Pack keeps waging war!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader of the pack must have this ancient werewolf bloodline like Isaac, Alpha Jack must want to kill Isaac to gain his power!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This kind of power could easily make the mind lose control, and I had the ability to control the mind, when Blood Moon Pack wanted to take me away, I was afraid it was because of this reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I figured out the reason for this, I felt some cold sweat appear on my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to find a way to tell this Isaac this thing, maybe this can help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was full of worry, but I now have no way to tell Isaac this news, because now my child would soon be born, I have no way to go to the side of Isaac who was at war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;What should I do now?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although my current witchcraft ability was far from what I could compare to a few months ago, I looked at my bulging abdomen, and there was no way I could perform prolonged or violent exercise now, because I could hurt my child if I wasn&#39;t careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started to think, but just as I was having these anxious moments, a painful sensation started to come from my abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;Could it be that my baby is being born?&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise appeared in my heart and I immediately looked to the servant who was still standing next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&amp;quot;You go and call the doctor immediately!&amp;quot;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed quickly, perhaps because of my health, the process of my delivery was not too difficult, and after the doctors&#39; efforts, I heard the baby&#39;s cries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My baby was born.</p>
