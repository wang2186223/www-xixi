                <p>Lucas&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Serena and I settled into the back seat of the sedan, I couldn&#39;t help but notice the four bodyguards-one driving, another in the passenger seat, and two more following in a separate car. My face tightened with displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Atticus arrange these for you?&#34; I asked, my voice carrying an edge I couldn&#39;t quite conceal. Something about another man providing protection for my woman stirred an uncomfortable feeling in my chest-a mixture of jealousy and territorial instinct I rarely acknowledged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s concerned for my safety,&#34; Serena replied without hesitation, her eyes meeting mine directly. &#34;Who knows what Rachel might try next!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though irritation simmered beneath my surface, I swallowed it down. Her safety mattered more than my pride. The thought of Rachel&#39;s previous schemes made my jaw clench-Serena had legitimate reasons to be cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Atticus couldn&#39;t possibly be interested in me. What are you jealous of?&#34; Serena said with a hint of exasperation in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I deliberately kept my tone light, masking the deeper emotions. &#34;I&#39;ll collect on that debt later, gorgeous.&#34; What mattered most was that she understood my feelings, even when left unspoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena&#39;s lips curved into a teasing smile. &#34;Is that a threat or a promise, Mr. Harrington?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her expression shifted to something more serious. &#34;Tell me, did you really just discover that the Thorne family has been using your name for their schemes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing her direct question, I decided there would be no more half-truths between us. She deserved complete honesty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I admitted plainly. &#34;I&#39;m a businessman too. I prioritize profit when necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So...&#34; She waited for me to continue, her eyes searching mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I discovered it quite some time ago,&#34; I confessed, recalling the internal struggle that had accompanied that knowledge. &#34;I simply chose not to intervene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So as long as it posed no threat to you, you were content to let it continue?&#34; she asked, her voice carefully neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps,&#34; I nodded, acknowledging a truth that might disappoint her, but I refused to pretend to be someone I wasn&#39;t-not with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena pressed her lips together thoughtfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a good man, but I&#39;m certainly not a bad one either,&#34; I explained, hoping she would understand my position. &#34;I&#39;m simply not noble enough to risk my assets or personal safety. Confronting the Thornes-if it failed, I&#39;d be the one to pay the price, and it would endanger everyone close to me. I couldn&#39;t take that risk.&#34; I paused, watching her reaction. &#34;Besides, fraud typically requires both a deceiver and someone willing to be deceived. Without that greed, no one would fall for the trap. It&#39;s merely a costly lesson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not judging you,&#34; Serena said, and I felt relief wash over me. &#34;In your position, I might have done the same. Before doing good deeds, you have to protect your family first. That&#39;s understandable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her understanding warmed something deep within me. &#34;Thank you for understanding, dear wife,&#34; I said, the corner of my mouth lifting, deliberately using &#34;wife&#34; to close the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was Benjamin Kennedy brought in specially by you?&#34; Serena continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I answered, holding nothing back from her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would Kennedy help you? Is he truly as righteous and unyielding as rumors suggest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not exactly,&#34; I shook my head, wanting her to understand the complex dynamics at play. &#34;I can&#39;t judge his character since our interactions have been limited. But in true partnerships, feelings are secondary-interests are fundamental.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has something to gain by going after the Thornes?&#34; she asked perceptively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; I explained. &#34;On the surface, the Kennedy and Thorne families appear harmonious, but underneath, they&#39;re locked in constant conflict. Each wants to claim the other&#39;s territory, and each fears being dragged down by the other. Given the opportunity, they&#39;ll stomp on each other without hesitation. For them, eliminating rivals one by one is standard practice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are family dynasties really that ruthless?&#34; she asked, surprise evident in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you think reaching the heights was easy?&#34; I asked with a slight smile, realizing how sheltered she still was from certain realities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that why you liquidated the Harrington family assets? Because you understood all these schemes and didn&#39;t want to be entangled in dynasty politics anymore?&#34; Serena questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question made my heart sink. She had guessed part of it, but not the complete truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not entirely,&#34; I replied, my eyes darkening slightly as I struggled with how to explain this complex decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Serena&#39;s worried expression, I knew I had to tell her everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kennedy made me do this,&#34; I said deliberately, each word measured. I looked directly into Serena&#39;s eyes, sensing the emotional turmoil within her. I knew this answer would worry her, but honesty was necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression immediately tensed. &#34;Benjamin Kennedy? What&#39;s his objective?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I understood her confusion. She had assumed I sold Harrington International Holdings merely to protect myself, following my grandfather Howard&#39;s example of withdrawing from worldly affairs and controversies. She hadn&#39;t anticipated the Kennedy family connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can probably guess,&#34; I said softly, watching the emotions play across her face. I could see realization dawning-the very answer she dreaded most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest moved slightly, her eyes flashing with concern. I needed to tell her everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Kennedy wants me to assist him, but Harrington International&#39;s profile is too prominent now. He needs me with a lower profile, working alongside him,&#34; I explained slowly, hoping she would comprehend my situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Assist him with what?&#34; Serena asked. &#34;What ambitions does he harbor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing her question, I could only be forthright: &#34;The Kennedy family situation resembles the Thornes&#39;. While the Thorne family experienced internal branch conflicts, the Kennedy brothers are engaged in both open and hidden power struggles. Kennedy wants to use me to suppress his brothers and secure his position as the family heir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t he already the heir?&#34; Serena asked, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I understood her confusion. Public rumors indeed portrayed Benjamin Kennedy as the heir apparent-the eldest son, highly respected within the Kennedy family, and undeniably capable. His inheritance seemed natural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I&#39;m not fully informed yet,&#34; I shrugged. &#34;I&#39;ll learn more once I&#39;m deeper inside.&#34; I hadn&#39;t completely grasped the Kennedy family&#39;s internal complexities, but I knew this path was unavoidable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern sparkled in Serena&#39;s eyes. &#34;Must you entangle yourself with them? Can&#39;t we simply withdraw completely and live our lives peacefully?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words brought both warmth and pain to my heart. For her, I would sacrifice everything, but reality prevented us from simply living an ordinary life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll try to extricate myself as soon as possible,&#34; I promised, though I knew internally that since deciding to completely break with the Thorne family, I no longer had choices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without Kennedy&#39;s influence, my lawsuit would never have proceeded smoothly. If Kennedy hadn&#39;t intimidated the chief judge to continue the trial today, my case would have been suppressed, and the Thorne family would have quietly disposed of all compelling evidence. I needed an even stronger force to counter the Thornes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To use this power meant negotiating with Benjamin Kennedy. He directly requested my help, and I agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucas, is it worth it?&#34; Serena suddenly asked, her eyes already red-rimmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at her tear-filled eyes, my heart clenched painfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I had accepted the engagement to Rachel Thorne, even though the Thorne family was using me, as long as this arrangement remained unquestioned, we could have coexisted peacefully. The alliance between Harrington and Thorne would have elevated both families. After Clarence Thorne removed Silas Thorne and controlled both political and commercial spheres, anything would have been possible. Among elite families, no one disturbs the others lightly. Once the Thorne family&#39;s internal conflicts resolved, everything would have proceeded smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet for her sake, I abandoned this clear path only to mire myself in another quagmire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; I met her gaze directly, using my finger-seemingly reduced to just bone-to gently wipe away her tears. I said sincerely: &#34;For me, losing you means losing the entire world. Without you, what use would I have for anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serena looked at me emotionally, and in that moment, I felt unwavering certainty. Whatever the future held, I would never regret my current choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her phone suddenly rang. I watched as she glanced at the caller ID, composed herself, and answered: &#34;Atticus.&#34;</p>
