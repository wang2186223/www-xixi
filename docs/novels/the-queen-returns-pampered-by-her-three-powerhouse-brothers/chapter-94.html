                <p>Each team was required to step onto the stage and give a brief introduction of their paper&#39;s findings and how they validated them. Usually, every member presented their part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Rylie was alone, so she had to give the introduction all by herself. She took the mic, her gaze calm and steady as she scanned the audience before speaking. &#34;Hello, everyone, I&#39;m Rylie. I completed all the research and experiments for this paper on my own. It&#39;s an honor to be shortlisted for this medical competition. I welcome open discussion and gladly share all the data and findings from my work.&#34;</p>

                <p>After all, Rylie was still a student-young and without a guiding professor. The fact that she completed such a complex paper on her own in just two days raised doubts about its quality and authenticity, as no one knew whether her findings had been validated or not. What was more, she was up against teams led by top professors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most assumed she was only here for the experience, not the prize. Even the mentors shared that view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the host returned to the stage and began announcing the winners, along with the prize money for each category.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First, the third prize goes to &#39;The Application of Gene Therapy in Parkinson&#39;s Disease&#39; by Professor Marcelo Watts&#39;team!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Applause broke out as a middle-aged professor and his students walked up to receive their award-a two-hundred-thousand-dollar research grant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next, the second prize goes to &#39;Clinical Research on Stem Cell Transplantation for Spinal Cord Injury,&#39; by Academician Padgett Ward&#39;s team!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cheers followed as Padgett&#39;s team secured a three-hundred-thousand-dollar grant. Students onstage congratulated one another with boright smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next, the first prize winner would be revrealed. Stetson&#39;s team began adjusting their clothes, preparing to take the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard the first prize comes with five hundred thousand dollars!&#34; one student whispered excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stetson stayed composed, his hands resting on the table. &#34;Let&#39;s not celebrate too soon. It&#39;s not our turn yet,&#34;he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The students glanced at each other. &#34;Professor Ahmed, the next one is the first prize,&#34; one of them said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey chimed in softly, her tone full of confidence, &#34;We deserve better than that. With your guidance, we&#39;re sure to win the gold award. I heard this award didn&#39;t even exist before. It was added just for us because of the breakthrough in our research.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stetson chuckled. &#34;Yes, I heard the same. The gold award comes with one million in funding. Besides,they would help us set up a full research team and secure our future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For them, winning that award meant everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey&#39;s eyes sparkled as she looked toward the stage, already imagining herself being called Dr. Payne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host cleared his throat and smiled mysteriously.&#34;Now, for the first prize in this competition... The winner is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, building suspense as his gaze swept the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Application of Gene Editing Technology in Neurodegenerative Diseases, by Professor Stetson Ahmed&#39;s team!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted in cheers. But Stetson&#39;s smile vanished. He tightened his grip on the meeting manual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His students beamed and exchanged hugs, not noticing that Stetson, Stacey, and other team members looked stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey&#39;s smile faded. Wasn&#39;t the gold award supposed to be theirs? W/hy had they only won first prize?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others, influenced by Stetson&#39;s earlier words too, looked confused. &#34;Weren&#39;t we promised the gold award? What happened?&#34; one student whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did the committee change it last minute?&#34; another muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or... Was there never a gold award to begin with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speculation filled the air, but no one dared speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Professor Ahmed and team, please come up to receive your award,&#34; the host called again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey leaned closer to Stetson. &#34;Everyone&#39;s watching. Let&#39;s go onstage first. I believe we still have a shot at the gold. Maybe it&#39;s just a mix-up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stetson forced a smile and rose stiffly, his eyes locked on the envelope still in the host&#39;s hand-the one that hadn&#39;t been opened yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind raced. Who could&#39;ve taken the gold award? He had reviewed most of the papers and found none that could rival his.Except...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned slightly and looked at Rylie. He hadn&#39;t bothered to read her submission properly. It was a student&#39;s solo project, unpolished and untested. He dismissed it after a quick glance. There was no way...Or was there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked up the steps, his thoughts swirled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each step felt like walking on clouds-light, dizzying, unreal. The cheers in the hall blurred into buzzing noise. Five hundred thousand dollars. On any other day, it would&#39;ve been a dream come true. But right now,it felt like a slap in the face. His hopes of securing a bright future had just cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, Professor Ahmed. Please say a few words,&#34; the host said, handing over the trophy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stetson took the mic and swallowed his frustration. &#34;First, I&#39;d like to thank the committee for their recognition...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His speech was short and stiff. Hiseyes kept drifting toward the final unopened envelope. Who had taken the award that was supposed to be his?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The joy of winning had vanished. For him and his team, the ceremony had turned into a bitter pill. Once offstage, all eyes turned to the host, waiting for the final announcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, the host stepped forward. &#34;Originally, the ceremony was to end here. But among the submissions,one stood out. Its value to the medical field far exceeded even our top expectations. Because of this, the committee unanimously agreed to add a gold award above the first prize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>le paused and glanced at the card in his hand before continuing, &#34;And the winner of this award might urprise you.l know I was certainly stunned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>e took a deep breath and read aloud. &#34;The gold award goes to the author of &#39;Novel Discoveries and Clinical Applications of Neuroregenerative Factors&#39;-Rylie Owen!&#34;</p>
