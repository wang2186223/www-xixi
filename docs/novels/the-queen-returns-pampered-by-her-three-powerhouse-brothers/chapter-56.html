                <p>Rylie glanced at the clock and saw that it was nearly time to leave. She gave the sheet music and hairpin to the servant and said, &#34;Please take this music back to my room. Give the hairpin to Paola. She probably left it behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant gave a nod. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Rylie stepped out of the music room, a man wearing a hat entered and slowly made his way through the library. His eyes scanned the empty space as he muttered, &#34;That&#39;s odd. I thought I heard music in here. Where did Paola go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Paola sat alone in the guest room,fidgeting with her hands. She kept glancing at the door, but no one came in. The security guard had already said that Spencer was on the property, but she hadn&#39;t seen him. Had he gotten lost?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola rose from her seat and headed out, intending to find him herself. On her way through the corridor,she spotted the servant carrying the sheet music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen Director Aguilar?&#34; she asked quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant shook her head. &#34;No. I came from the library. Miss Owen asked me to hand this to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola took the hairpin without much thought and slipped it into her pocket. Then she continued down the hallway and finally saw Spencer standing near the library. She smiled as she called out, &#34;Director Aguilar!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer turned to her with a grin. &#34;Paola, I was just about to find you. Why did you leave without a word?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola froze at the question. Leave? What was he talking about? She had waited for him in the guest room the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Paola could respond, Spencer started speaking again. &#34;You&#39;ve finally proven your musical ability. The arrangement today reminded me of Marcus&#39; early work. Every concern I brought up in the email -gone. The opening now sounds exactly as l imagined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s expression faltered. She didn&#39;t know what Spencer was talking about. She hadn&#39;t even approached the piano today. She had spent the morning preparing for Spencer&#39;s arrival. The sheet music hadn&#39;t been touched since yesterday.Then who had played it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer&#39;s admiration deepened, and whatever Paola wanted to explain faded in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer removed his hat and went on, &#34;That melody - just preserve it. Add the rest when you can. I&#39;ll assign someone to write the lyrics and use it for the opening act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened a notebook from his briefcase and added,&#34;Do you have a full version of it? I&#39;d like to note the main theme. It&#39;s absolutely beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s eyes wandered past Spencer toward the library, her mind replaying what the servant had said earlier when delivering the hairpin. Someone else had been in there this morning-Rylie. Could it really have been her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The sheet music still needs work,&#34; said Paola, her voice low and dry. Her throat felt tight. &#34;There are a few parts that still need fixing. It&#39;s not ready just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer gave her shoulder a light pat. &#34;No need to rush. What I&#39;ve seen so far is already quite good.Can you send me the full version by next week? Then we&#39;ll consider it settled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Paola gave a slow nod. Inside, her thoughts swirled in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer then said, &#34;We&#39;ll leave that for now. ls Marcus home? The academy in Crolens is marking its anniversary. Their principal asked me to pass along an invitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola answered quickly, &#34;Marcus is at home. He should be in the study. I&#39;ll have someone lead you there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Spencer finally turned away, her legs nearly gave out. She leaned against the wall, trying to catch her breath. Her chest tightened. Her vision began to dim. Was it truly Rylie who had played that piece?The servant had said that the items were from the library. She was sure that the delivery was for Rylie&#39;s room. But how could Rylie even know how to play?And even if she did, how could Rylie match her level of skill? The composition alone should have been out of her reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... no way.&#34; Paola&#39;s whisper trembled out. She refused to believe that Rylie could impress Spencer or write music to match her own.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie arrived just in time, jogging up to the entrance of the Morgan Estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were more attendees at this seminar than there were when she had rushed to save Brad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People were still coming in. Rylie joined them,dressed plainly in a white tracksuit and wearing a sun hat. She looked nothing like the usual guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards at the gate hesitated. They didn&#39;t recognize her unti she took off her hat and said, &#34;I live nearby. Thought I&#39;d run here this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone on the estate knew that Brad had recently delivered a gift to the Owen family&#39;s daughter. They just hadn&#39;t connected that person to Rylie. Still, many remembered that she had once saved Brad&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as one of the guards moved to let her pass, a taunting voice cut through the air behind her.&#34;So you&#39;re still pretending to represent Aetheris Pharmacy? And now you&#39;ve shown up here to milk the Morgans for favors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha appeared beside Evita, helping her walk.Behind them were Timothy and Yosef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each one of them had clashed with Rylie before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie lifted an eyebrow and replied with a small grin,&#34;Well,look who it is. The gang&#39;s all here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We aren&#39;t close,&#34; said Timothy coldly. &#34;I don&#39;t recognize frauds as my students. Especially ones who hide behind the name of healing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice rang with contempt. His glare was sharp</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and full of malice. &#34;Where&#39;s the Morgan security?Someone get over here and toss her out!&#34; he shouted.</p>
