                <p>At exactly noon, the cloth was swept away with theatrical flair, marking the long-awaited unveiling of the results. The students instinctively parted,stepping aside to allow Rylie, Stacey, and Fred the front row to see the list first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred guided Stacey straight to the bottom of the list,scanning upward with quíck, eager eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Stacey noticed that Rylie&#39;s name wasn&#39;t anywhere near the bottom, her heant fluttered with a secret burst of delight. She immediately assumed that Rylie had turned in another blank exam and hadn&#39;t even made the rankings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squeezing Fred&#39;s hand, Stacey tilted her head and said to Rylie with faux concern, her voice soft and dripping with carefully crafted pity, &#34;You&#39;re not even at the bottom this time, Rylie, Maybe it&#39;s time you stop trying to compete with me,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred gave a smug chuckle. &#34;Looks like you owe me,Rylie. A deal&#39;s a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Rylie&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t budge from the top of the list.&#34;Why don&#39;t you check the first part of this list?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred scoffed with disbelief. &#34;Still clinging to your pride,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a cluster of students surrounding the top of the list let out startledgasps. &#34;Oh my god! It&#39;s Rylie&#39;s name!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rylie&#39;s ranked first!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As more voices joined the chorus, confmming what seemed unthinkable, Stacey&#39;s face frore &#34;That&#39;s not possible!&#34; she snapped, yanking her hand from Fred&#39;s and dashing to where those students gathered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was - Rylie&#39;s name gleaming in bold letters at the very top, while Stacey&#39;s name sat quietly in tenth place. The margin between Rylie and the runner-up was wide enough to leave no doubt-it as at most had been a sweeping victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impossible!&#34; Fred echoed, trailing after Stacey, his eyes bulging in disbelief. &#34;Rylie must&#39;ve cheated!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie arched a brow. &#34;So the moment I come in first,it must be cheating?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey stood frozen. She couldn&#39;t fathom Rylie beating her, but rather than launch a direct accusation, she chose a gentler route, her voice lOW and carefully measured, &#34;Fred, Ryllie hrsi wanted one moment to shine, She&#39;s already been rejectad by her brothers and carries that weight owery day. Let&#39;s just pretend her results are raal, Thore&#39;s no mecd to say they weren&#39;t earned,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sounded forgiving, but ānyone páyíng close attention could hear the implication loud and clear-Rylie had cheated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among the onlookers were three students who usually held top spots in the rankings. Outraged,they immediately voiced their protests, urging the school to mullity Rylie&#39;s results. The cheating rumors spread like wildfire and soon reached the school administration. Rylie, Stacey, and a few others were called into the office for questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The school leaders insisted that parents be contacted to settle the matter, but Rylie calmly responded, &#34;My family&#39;s far away. I have no way of reaching them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the principal could reply, Stacey siepped in sweetly. &#34;Please don&#39;t worry. I&#39;H call my second brother. Rylie&#39;s still part of the Kirk fammily. Sha&#39;s just upset.., and made a mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred nodded in approval. &#34;You&#39;ne too kind, Stacey.Rylie doesn&#39;t deserve to be your sister- not with that spiteful attitude,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey&#39;s reply was gentle, her tone polished. &#34;Don&#39;t speak about Rylie like that. I know she is a kind gírl ín nature, and I dom&#34;t want her to lose her way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland, who worked nearby at VitaLink Hospital,showed up soon after Stacey&#39;s call, carrying a smail neatly boxed strawberry cake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey accepted the box with a smile, then turned to Rylie. &#34;Rylie, Leland only brought one cake for me.He forgot you liked it too - but I&#39;ll share half wth you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Leland stepped in, reclaiming the cake and talking to Rylie with open disdain. &#34;s she even worthy of sharing your cake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Rylie, Leland&#39;s tone grew even colder.&#34;Cheating on your exam just to goi back at Stacoy and win my attention? Do you ewon raalize how foolish you&#39;re being?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s expression remained untoadatie y didn&#39;t cheat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rylie, you&#39;re still lying when the evidence is right there? You&#39;re always at the bottom, and Stacey&#39;s the one who&#39;s done your work for years. All you do is slack off at home, and now we&#39;re supposed to believe you miraculously came first? Isn&#39;t your motive clear? Just admit what you did and ask your teacherfor leniency. Punishment is better than expulsion.&#34;Leland&#39;s voice was cold as ice as he added,&#34;Supposedly, this is for your own good-why can&#39;t you see that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, mocking laugh escaped Rylie. &#34;For my own good? Then why label me a cheater before even investigating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s temper snapped. He turned to the principal and Rylie&#39;s homeroom teacher. &#34;There&#39;s nothing to investigate. Rylie cheated out or jaalouty for Siacoy.She&#39;s no longer part of out tamily - do whai you must.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teacher agreed at once, and wwith ā hiāndfull of words,Rylie was branded a chaater,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred said, &#34;So that&#39;s why you dared bet with me-you planned to cheat your way to first place! Now that the truth is out, Rylie, it&#39;s time to kneel and apologize to Stacey, or pay up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s brows furrowed. &#34;What bet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey quíckly explained, displaying her scratched palm and looking wounded but understanding,&#34;Leland, Rylie didn&#39;t push me on purpose- she&#39;s just hurt after leaving the family. Fred only made the bet to defend me. It&#39;s a silly bet; it shouldn&#39;t count.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred shook his head. &#34;See, Stacey? You&#39;re too soft.That&#39;s wwhy you keep getting bullied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Leland saw Stacey&#39;s scratched lhand, his anger reignited. &#34;Rylie is no longer one of us. The bet stands!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now everyone had turned agminat Ryllie, waiting for her humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Rylie, calm as ever, pulled out her phone and dialed the school&#39;s largest shareholder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rory, there&#39;s an issue here. My homeroom teacher and the principal think I cheated. Can wou come deal with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second he heard Rylie, Rory perked up like a kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay put-I&#39;m coming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred scoffed, &#34;You really think someone will save you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie replied calmly,&#34;You&#39;ll see soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Rory could arrive, the dean of the medical school burst into the office and whispered urgently to the principal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The principal&#39;s face went palle. Are you certain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dean nodded. &#34;We must look indo Ryl&#34;si Case more.thoroughly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing his throat, the prncipal molioned for the dean to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dean addressed the room,&#34;Nor long ago,Rylie saved a critical patient at the research institute.She&#39;s made remarkable progress, and her foundation is solid. Accusing her of cheating is mot something we should do lightly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland glared. &#34;There&#39;s nothing to investigate. I know my sister-she cheated. Punish her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dean didn&#39;t even acknowledge him. &#34;Rylie, if you truly believe you&#39;re innocent, I have a more challenging test. If you score above eighty percent,we&#39;ll know the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s original plan was to let Roryhandle this, and she hadn&#39;t expected that the dean would offer her such a chance to prove herself. But it looked like the dean was doing this under someone&#39;s requirement.So, who was behind this? And why did they help her?She didn&#39;t know the answer, but she told herself that she couldn&#39;t let this chance slip. &#34;Okay, I&#39;d like to try it.&#34;</p>
