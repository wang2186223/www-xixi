                <p>&#34;Who said I ever wanted to join your team?&#34; Rylie scoffed coldly. &#34;Do you really see yourself as my brother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip&#39;s smug expressioninstantly froze. The club members around him exchanged incredulous lookS,their murmurs rising in surprise. &#34;What? You&#39;re not racing with us this year?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every year, Rylie participated in the club&#39;s races,though she was conspicuously absent from their pre-and post-race gatherings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been just a tool to guarantee Stacey&#39;s victories and the club&#39;s prestige.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip immediately frowned, his tone sharp with reprimand. &#34;Don&#39;t be so ungrateful. Racing with us has always been an honor for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie laughed bitterly. &#34;An honor? Is my name even on the team&#39;s official roster?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip stared at her in disbelief. &#34;Why fuss over trivial details? Obviously, the official position is reserved for Stacey. You being a substitute is already the greatest honor I&#39;ve bestowed on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie sneered, raising her head to meet Phillip&#39;s eyes,her gaze icy, &#34;Phillip, every year l&#39;ve raced as Stacey&#39;s stand-in, running the full course, only for her to claim the trophy and prize money. Exactly what honor have l ever received?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s because Stacey is more dependable than you! Her skills are no less impressive!&#34; Phillip snapped defensively. &#34;Besides, Stacey has endured so much hardship from you ever since she lived with us.Helping her is your responsibility!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People surrounding Phillip chimed in, attempting to coax Rylie, &#34;Yes, Stacey is kind and devoted to racing. It&#39;s fitting she gets recognition. Rylie, you&#39;re family-don&#39;t be so petty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m no longer a Kirk,&#34; Rylie shot back sharply. &#34;And I won&#39;t be racing with you again. If you want trophies,go earn them yourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip was momentarily stunned, never expecting such defiance from Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flared in him. &#34;Rylie! You don&#39;t really believe our team needs you to win, do you? I only offered you a place out of pity, to help you earn a little cash so you wouldn&#39;t resort to hanging around rich old men! Are you aiming to become a gold digger?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip&#39;s words dripped venom, and Rylie didn&#39;t hesitate. Her hand flashed out and struck him across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slap sent Phillip sprawling to the floor, blood trickling from his split lip. Stunned, he stared up in disbelief. &#34;You dare hit me!&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie shook her stinging hand, her voice calm yet ruthless. &#34;Since Stacey is so talented, let her lead your team to victory. Don&#39;t bother me again - or next time, I&#39;ll make sure you won&#39;t even be able to lways Right drive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having joined Britton&#39;s racing club, Rylie relished the thought of facing them as rivals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being knocked down by a woman in public crushed Phillip&#39;s pride. Fury overcoming his humiliation, he sprang to his feet, lunging to grab Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Security swiftly intervened as chaos erupted,and Clive, alerted by the commotion, returned to the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip struggled against the guards, the vivid slap mark making his expression even more ferocious.&#34;Rylie, is this who you really are? You&#39;ve always bullied Stacey and exploited my kindness! Today, as your brother, I&#39;ll teach you a lesson!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34; Clive immediately stepped protectively in front of Rylie, his voice stern. &#34;How dare you cause trouble for my guest? Get out! You and your team are permanently banned from the Savory Haven!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who do you think you are? The customer is always right-you can&#39;t throw me out!&#34; Phillip spat angrily, fighting against the guards. &#34;No one can stop me from disciplining my sister today!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regular patrons recognized Clive and warned softly,&#34;Kirk boy, you&#39;d better not offend Mr. Perry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those in the know were aware of Clive&#39;s connections to the powerful Morgan family, and his wife was a key figure in the world&#39;s largest restaurant empire.The Kirk family was insignificant in comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip, oblivious to these facts, continued ranting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a simple gesture from Clive, security threw Phillip and his followers out onto the street. Clive then declared firmly, &#34;From now on, all Kirk family members are banned from every establishment I own. Take your entitled attitude somewhere else!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive didn&#39;t just own one restaurant; he also had many cafés, bars, and eateries favored by high society. Being banned by Clive meant that Phillip would be excluded from future elite gatherings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after being expelled and meeting contemptuous stares from passersby did Phillip realize his blunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemingly insignificant middle-aged man was actually the restaurant&#39;s influential owner, and Rylie was his honored guest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could this be? Rylie, who should&#39;ve been a penniless outcast, knew such a prominent figure?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad emerged from the elevator, approaching Rylie with concern when he noticed the ruined cake in her hands. &#34;The driver said he hadn&#39;t seen you yet. What happened here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing much, just ran into some unpleasant company.&#34; Rylie brushed it off, looking at Brad curiously. &#34;Finished your meeting already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d hurried out of worry, anticipating trouble, but Brad simply nodded. &#34;Yes. Let&#39;s go,I&#39;ll drive you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed the elevator button and waited courteously, allowing her to step inside first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie entered confidently, and Brad leaned slightly toward her, their closeness spaking curiosity among observers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time anyone had seen the enigmatic Brad openly attentive toward a seemingly unknown girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the roadside, Phillip stared bitterly as a tall man in a luxury suit held open a car door for Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just any car - its sheer extravagance revealed the man&#39;s elevated status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had Rylie&#39;s circumstances changed so drastically?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in thought, Phillip barely noticed when a fellow racer tapped his shoulder. &#34;Maybe you should head home. Didn&#39;t you say it was Stacey&#39;s birthday today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping out of it, Phillip quickly left for home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, upon arriving, the usually festive house was unsettlingly quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why isn&#39;t there a celebration?&#34; Phillip asked,confused. &#34;Where&#39;s Stacey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland rubbed his temples wearily, his tone cold and frustrated. &#34;Don&#39;t even mention her. You have no idea what trouble she&#39;s caused.&#34;</p>
