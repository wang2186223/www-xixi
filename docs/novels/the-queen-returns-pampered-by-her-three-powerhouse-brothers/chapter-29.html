                <p>Stacey hesitated. &#34;Phillip, I&#39;ve trained so long for this race. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m any worse than Rylie. Why can&#39;t I be the one to compete?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the crew chimed in, &#34;Let Rylie handle it. She reacts better to sudden turns. Tonight&#39;s course is brutal-we&#39;re racing on a mountain road. We&#39;re just looking out for Stacey&#39;s safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip nodded. &#34;They&#39;re right. It&#39;s risky out there. I don&#39;t want anything to happen to you. Let Rylie do it.You&#39;ll still get credit either way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey didn&#39;t want to argue or take the risk. She faked a disappointed look and gave a small nod. &#34;If that&#39;s what you think is best, Phillip, then okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip gave her head a gentle pat. &#34;I&#39;ll go sign Rylie up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton was about to wave Rylie over when Phillip bumped into him on purpose. He narrowed his eyes.&#34;You&#39;re starting to act really smug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip gave a short glance. &#34;Facing someone who always loses? | think I&#39;ve earned it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton raised a brow. &#34;Don&#39;t start talking like a winner just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip ignored him and stepped forward, cutting Rylie off. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say you weren&#39;t coming? So what are you doing here now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie stared at him flatly. &#34;Why do you care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip clenched his jaw but said nothing at first. The race was about to begin, and he forced himself to stay calm. &#34;If you insist on racing for my team, fine. I&#39;ll allow it. I&#39;m letting the past go-even after how you treated Stacey. The race is starting soon. Go sign in. You&#39;ll be the backup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a short, cold laugh. &#34;Backup? Phillip, are you serious? Did I ever agree to race for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip&#39;s face froze. He raised his voice. &#34;Then why are you at the sign-in booth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss!&#34; Britton suddenly stepped in between them, nudging Phillip out of the way as he grabbed  Rylie&#39;s arm. &#34;You promised you&#39;d race for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip suddenly understood that Rylie had chosen Britton&#39;s team, and he nearly exploded with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rylie! You&#39;re actually joining Britton&#39;s team! You do know he&#39;s our biggest rival this year, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie smirked. &#34;Why are you upset? Didn&#39;t you brag that your team could win first without me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip snapped, &#34;But that doesn&#39;t mean you can join Britton&#39;s team. That&#39;s betrayal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Betrayal?&#34; Rylie&#39;s face turned cold. Her voice sharpened. &#34;You aIl kicked me out. Your family disowned me in public. I was never part of you to begin with.&#34; If anything, they betrayed her first!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip&#39;s mouth opened, but no words came out. His face burned with anger. &#34;Fine. One last offer. Join my team and I&#39;ll split the prize money with you. I&#39;ll even let you stand on the podium.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No thanks.&#34; Rylie brushed past Britton and walked straight up to Phillip. She met his eyes and said clearly, &#34;I&#39;m going to win this race. That trophy? It&#39;s mine. Not yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip was fuming. All he could do was yell, &#34;Unbelievable! You really think you&#39;ll win without being on my team? Rylie, you&#39;re going to lose-and badly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Britton looked pleased as ever. He led Rylie straight to the sign-in area where she signed her name under his team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip&#39;s crew stared in disbelief. &#34;What just happened? Why would Rylie choose Britton&#39;s side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey spoke quietly.&#34;It&#39;s probably because I joined. Maybe she didn&#39;t want to be on the same team.Should I just drop out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip snapped his head toward her.&#34;Absolutely not! You&#39;ve been training with me all this time. It would mean nothing if you quit now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey&#39;s eyes welled up. &#34;But Rylie doesn&#39;t want to be here. Maybe I should say sorry. Ask her to come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip&#39;s voice rose. &#34;No! I only asked her to race out of sympathy. We&#39;ll win with or without her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over on Britton&#39;s side, Rylie was welcomed with cheers. The team looked thrilled to have her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton turned to her. &#34;Boss, the mountain road&#39;s rough tonight. The weather shifts fast, and the cold hits hard. Which lap do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This race had six team members per side. Each one ran a full lap. The fastest team overall would win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Phillip&#39;s side had always counted on Rylie to make up for Stacey&#39;s slow time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with worse weather and a tougher course, Rylie glanced toward Stacey and said, &#34;Phillip&#39;s team probably kept her as the final lap. I flew in by helicopter. The top of the mountain&#39;s already raining.Roads are slick and freezing, and it&#39;s only going to get worse as we go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton nodded. &#34;So, you&#39;re taking the last lap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryle gave a firm nod. &#34;I am. I&#39;ll show Phillip exactly what happens when he puts the wrong person at the finish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton grinned. &#34;If you&#39;re driving the last leg, we&#39;re not losing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The starting horn blared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lights flashed across the track.Excitement rippled through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jake Hardy, the first racer from Phillip&#39;s team, walked upto Rylie and spoke in a low voice. &#34;We always saw you as family. What you did tonight really stung. Your brother&#39;s hurt. So are we.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;You say I was family, but I&#39;ve never been allowed on the podium. Not once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jake looked away. &#34;I thought you weren&#39;t the type to care about that kind of recognition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie let out a laugh and flipped him off. &#34;Recognition? Then why are you even racing for first? Just for fun? And if you&#39;re so above it all, why didn&#39;t any of you give me your spot on that podium?&#34;</p>
