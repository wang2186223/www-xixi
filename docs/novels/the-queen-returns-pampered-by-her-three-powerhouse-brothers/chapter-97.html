                <p>Selah set a small bowl of greens on the table, a quiet sigh slipping from her lips. &#34;Rylie&#39;s had to grow up fast She&#39;s been through more than her share with the Kirk family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t be her story anymore,&#34; Brad replied under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bit slow to catch his words, Selah lifted her head.&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>

                <p>Rylie lent Selah a hand, working together to finish up the cooking. When everything was ready, the three of them sat down to share the meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her usual warmth, Selah offered a polite smile.&#34;It&#39;s just a simple meal - please, make yourself comfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad took a bite of the stewed chicken, surprised by how tender and flavorful it was - far better than anything his private chef had prepared</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he wasn&#39;t known for having much of an appetite. tonight was different He found himself reaching for seconds without hesitation. It was the first time since his illness that he&#39;d eaten this much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah let out a soft laugh. &#34;Young people always eat well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peering curiously into the soup pot, Brad offered a genuine compliment. &#34;This is excellent. What&#39;s your secret?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah smiled warmly. &#34;That&#39;s thanks to Rylie. She&#39;s got a habit of wandering into the mountains to gather herbs and such. Says they&#39;re good for the body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a small nod, adding in her usual calm tone,&#34;Just a few leaves that help boost immunity. Eating them often keeps you healthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching how much Brad seemed to enjoy the meal,Selah couldn&#39;t help but smile. Knowing the kind of man he was-and knowing he&#39;d protect Rylie-she offered kindly, &#34;If you ever want more, feel free to stop by HaloFlow Pharmacy. Even if Rylie&#39;s not around,I&#39;Ll gladly cook for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Brad could respond, Rylie cut in with a playful tone, saying, &#34;Your cooking is amazing, but he&#39;s got a chef waiting on him at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing to ignore her, Brad looked at Selah and thanked her directly. &#34;Then I&#39;ll gladly take you up on that oftel</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie shot him a look, half surprised by how cheekily he accepted an elderly woman&#39;s kindness like it was nothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, seeing Selah&#39;s smile only deepen, she let it slide without further comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they&#39;d finished eating and rested for a while,Brad stood up to leave. Rylie stayed seated, her tone casual. &#34;I&#39;m spending the night here with Selah. You go on ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a slight nod. &#34;Okay then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After watching his car drive away, Rylie returned inside and sat at the coffee table, asking Selah,there something on your mind you wanted to tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet sigh, Selah shook her head. &#34;It&#39;s nothing,really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie knew better than to press. Letting out a sigh of her own, she dropped the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when morning came, the unexpected arrival of the Dury family caught her completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After freshening up, Rylie stepped into the courtyard -only to stop short at the sight before her. Scattered across the ground were several boxes. Out of curiosity, she flipped one open Inside lay a pile of jewelry-gaudy pieces with lackluster stones. Nothing impressive, though the lot might fetch a few hundred thousand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then,neighbors had already gathered near the gate,craning their necks to watch the scene unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Rylie come out, they teased with smiles,&#34;Which young gentleman has come to propose to Rylie,bringing so much stuff? It&#39;s worth a few million,isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows pulled together in confusion. Propose?What did that mean? Was she somehow getting married without even knowing it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the pharmacists from HaloFlow Pharmacy stepped outside and, spotting Rylie standing dazed in the courtyard, called out,&#34;Why are you just standing there? Everyone&#39;s already gathered in the front hall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s here to propose?&#34; Rylie finally snapped out of it and asked her first question of the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pharmacist blinked, looking puzzled. &#34;The Dury family. You really didn&#39;t know? They&#39;re already in a meeting with Selah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stunned look crossed Rylie&#39;s face.&#34;They&#39;ve got guts,showing up here with a proposal like this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bi the time she walked into the front hall, she found the small consultation room packed with Dury family members, all crowding around Selah as if they were already part of the family</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie strode in, her tone deliberately sharp. &#34;What&#39;s all this about? Did Mr. Fred Dury suddenly come down with some rare illness and pay in advance with all these gifts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, don&#39;t be silly.&#34; Selah quickly pulled Rylie to her side, giving her hand a reassuring pat. &#34;The Dury family is here to talk about your engagement.Have you forgotten? You were promised to them as a child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a raised brow, Rylie answered coolly, &#34;Pretty sure I broke off that engagement-publicly,too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah blinked, clearly caught off guard. &#34;You did? You called it off yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the look on Selah&#39;s face, Rylie finally realized where all the confusion had started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft, helpless laugh slipped from Rylie&#39;s lips.&#34;Wait a second-did you honestly think I got dumped? Is that why you called the Dury family here, trying to patch things up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah&#39;s face froze with awkwardness, while Fred stepped forward, forcing a sheepish smile. &#34;Rylie, come on I know the feelings between us are still there You still have love for me Whatever happened before- that&#39;s on me. Can&#39;t we just move past it and start over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing nearby, Fred&#39;s parents wore strained, eager smiles. Octavia quickly jumped in, her tone honeyed.&#34;It&#39;s my fault,really.I should&#39;ve raised him better. From now on, Rylie, you&#39;ll have the final say in anything involving the Dury family. Let me make it up to you,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a faint, polite smile. &#34;It was my mentor&#39;s mistake for arranging this. I owe you an apology,but as for marriage-there&#39;s no future for me and Fred.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah faltered, unsure. &#34;Rylie, are you really saying this because you mean it? I heard from the neighbors...they said it was all over the news, how you were publicly dumped. I thought you were heartbroken. I don&#39;t want my mistakes to cause you more pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft laugh, Rylie pressed her fingers to her temple. &#34;So this is what&#39;s been weighing on you these past few days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah reached up to cup Rylie&#39;s cheek, her eyes filled with quiet concern. Though she had worried about ruining Rylie&#39;s future, it seemed that fear had been unnecessary all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryle let out a light sigh and patiently explained. The Dury family isn&#39;t as respectable as you think Their so -called &#39;fine young man&#39; was dating me while sneaking around with Stacey. He wanted to string us both along -sisters, no less. Would you honestly accept that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Selah&#39;s face turned red with anger.Hands trembling, she snatched up the broom from the corner and stormed toward the Dury family. &#34;Leave!All of you, get out of my house! How dare you treat me like a fool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred ducked awkwardly, flustered as he tried to defend himself. &#34;Wait, please... Let me explain-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough with your lies!&#34; Selah swung the broom again,faster than anyone expected from someone her age.&#34;If you think you can bully Rylie, you&#39;ll have to deal with me first!&#34;</p>
