                <p>She lifted a brow. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved to Marcus&#39; lounge. Once they were alone, Spencer spoke sincerely, his earlier judgments pushed aside. &#34;Miss Owen, that composition... It was really yours, wasn&#39;t it? I heard the piano in the library.It had to be you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie sank into the sofa and answered with ease, &#34;Yes, I played it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things started falling into place for him. He had followed the music to the library, expecting to find Paola,but saw no one. They only ran into each other later in the reception hall. Now it all made sense. The person who was playing the piano at that time was Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened in his seat. &#34;We truly loved that piece. Would you consider selling the rights? It would be perfect for my film.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie thought about it before answering, &#34;I can&#39;t take full credit. The opening few bars came from Paola&#39;s discarded notes. I noticed them on her desk and finished the piece based on those.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a knowing smile. &#34;It could work as a shared composition. Paola sparked the idea, but | turned it into something complete. Her mistake was trying to pass it off as hers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer leaned forward slightly, unsure. &#34;So... what are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her tone calm. &#34;I don&#39;t mind a collaboration. Ask Paola if she&#39;s open to co-composing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer paused for a moment, then let out a quiet sigh. &#34;Looks like I was wrong about you. I&#39;m sorry for how I judged you earlier.&#34; He offered his hand. &#34;I doubt Paola will object. I&#39;ll get the contract drafted and send it over soon. Looking forward to our ongoing collaboration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie rose from her seat and shook his hand. &#34;I&#39;m looking forward to it too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Paola had just stepped out of the restroom, hoping to explain herself. As she neared Marcus&#39;lounge, she noticed the door left slightly open. Inside, she saw Rylie and Spencer shaking hands. The words &#34;looking forward to our ongoing collaboration&#34; echoed in her ears, making her legs feel like jelly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed the door open and burst in, her voice high with disbelief. &#34;Mr. Aguilar! How could you do this to me?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both turned to face her. Her eyes were red, her makeup streaked from tears, and her breathing unsteady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I poured nights into that music. You told me this was my shot!&#34; Her hand shot out toward Rylie. &#34;And now you want to team up with her? That melody was mine! She built that piece from my ideas! Doesn&#39;t that make her a thief too?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie lifted a brow, the corner of her lips curling. She didn&#39;t respond right away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer frowned and said, &#34;Paola, you&#39;ve misunderstood...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise reached Marcus, who arrived in time to catch the scene. &#34;What&#39;s all the shouting for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola turned to him, distraught. &#34;Even you think I&#39;m in the wrong? Just because she&#39;s family? You&#39;re letting her get away with stealing my work! Do I mean nothing to you? How can you be so unfair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, the lounge fell completely silent. Rylie stood up and slowly approached her, gently brushing a tear off Paola&#39;s cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You poor thing,&#34; she said, her voice soft. &#34;Mr. Aguilar&#39;s here to talk about co-authorship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola blinked, stunned.&#34;Wh...what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer handed her a tissue. &#34;Yes. Miss Owen suggested that the piece be credited to both of you. She even said the first few bars came from your early drafts. There&#39;s no plagiarism involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; expression turned icy. He faced Paola with no trace of warmth left. &#34;Rylie would never stoop to your level. Even when she&#39;s wrong, she doesn&#39;t go out of her way to drag others down.&#34; His voice stayed flat, but his words hit hard. &#34;You say I&#39;m being unfair? Maybe I am. That girl spent two decades out there, getting nothing from me. Not a single thing. But you? Paola, did we ever deny you anything? We gave you everything, and still, you chose to act like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s hands trembled slightly as she came to her senses. Her voice softened as she said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry,Marcus. I let my fear cloud my judgment. I didn&#39;t want to lose face in front of everyone. I thought if I missed this chance to work with Mr. Aguilar, I wouldn&#39;t get another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus didn&#39;t soften. &#34;You&#39;re afraid now? What about when you crept into Rylie&#39;s room to take what didn&#39;t belong to you? Were you afraid of being caught then?&#34; He then pulled Rylie close, shielding her from further shame and turning back to Paola. &#34;You&#39;ve let me down. Clearly, the Owen family failed to teach you restraint. You&#39;d better go back to your own family with your mother. Maybe the Garretts can knock some sense into you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola stood frozen. The idea of returning to her birth family struck her like lightning. That would mean severing ties with the Owen family!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath hitched as realization sank in. &#34;Marcus, please. I was wrong! I swear I would remember this lesson and never make the same mistake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Marcus didn&#39;t turn back. He walked out of the lounge beside Rylie, leaving behind a silence that spoke volumes. Spencer said nothing, but the way his eyes followed Rylie said more than words ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola dropped onto the nearby couch, mind spinning with fear and shame. Her phone buzzed. Laurel&#39;s name flashed across the screen. She answered through broken sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; Laurel asked,alarmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola couldn&#39;t hold it in. Her voice cracked as she wailed, &#34;Mom... please help me!&#34;</p>
