                <p>A flicker of uncertainty crossed Rylie&#39;s face. She lowered the piano lid, rising from the bench. &#34;Your sister? Me? You must be mistaken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus snapped out of his reverie and asked, &#34;I am sorry. Maybe I have your name?&#34; &#34;Rylie Kirk,&#34; she replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie Kirk? He remembered that his grandfather was sitting in a hospitaI room, waiting anxiously for a DNA match. The name on those records was the same:Rylie Kirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the signs lined up now. The way she played,the striking features- he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that she was family. Even so, Brad&#39;s advice came back to him. No matter how convincing, they couldn&#39;t reach out until every detail was confirmed. A false step could destroy everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully hiding his excitement, Marcus adopted a gentle tone as he drew closer. &#34;Forgive me, Miss Kirk. I lost my head for a moment. You resemble my sister so much. That piece - I&#39;ve never heard it before. Is it something you wrote?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave her head a quick shake. &#34;No, it isn&#39;t original. I came across a ruined score and did my best to restore what I could.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That revelation left Marcus speechless for a moment.Pieces like that were often the remnants of great composers, their legacies nearly erased by time.Bringing one back required uncommon skill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You pieced it together yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;I did. Is that strange?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus only smiled and shook his head. &#34;Not at all.Actually, it&#39;s impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie responded with a quiet laugh, modest as ever,&#34;I&#39;m hardly impressive. If I stand next to you, Mr.Marcus Owen, I&#39;d barely be noticed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyebrows shot up in mild surprise. &#34;So you recognize me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She released a gentle sigh, amusement in her voice.&#34;Do you really think anyone interested in music wouldn&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their quiet exchange came to an abrupt end when a breathless student burst into the music room,invitation in hand. &#34;Rylie! Mr. Dury sent this for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he noticed Marcus standing there,something about Marcus&#39; commanding presence erased any hint of ridicule from his face. He offered the envelope to Rylie, then added, &#34;There&#39;s a banquet at the Kirk residence tomorrow. They want you there to settle the issue with Mr. Dury- about your engagement.Attendance is required.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s brow furrowed. As if dealing with Stacey wasn&#39;t exhausting enough, now Fred had to step in as well. The two of them were making it painfully obvious that they wanted her out of the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let a sarcastic smile play on her lips and replied,&#34;Message received.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not daring to linger beneath Marcus&#39; intense gaze,the messenger quickly bowed his head and made a hasty exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A note of concern crept into Marcus&#39; voice. &#34;You&#39;re still studying, but they expect you to marry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shouldering her bag, Rylie started for the door,pausing only long enough to glance over her shoulder. &#34;No wedding-just a cancellation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surprise on Marcus&#39; face was unmistakable.&#34;Wait, so the Dury family is calling off the engagement? Anyone can see you&#39;re worth more than that,&#34; he retorted, his tone shifting fromn gentle to indignant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something strangely comforting about a stranger speaking up on her behalf. Rylie&#39;s smile,though faint, was tinged with irony. &#34;There&#39;s not much to it. I&#39;m just the unwanted stand-in, so none of this should shock you. Anyway, if you want some time with the piano, go ahead. I have to be somewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t offer any further explanation. With that,Rylie slipped past Marcus and disappeared down the staircase, leaving her parting words echoing behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the blue, Kendrick&#39;s call came through,brimming with enthusiasm. &#34;Marcus, the search is over - we&#39;ve located your sister! Wrap up your concert and head straight to Crolens!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of anxious hope surged in Marcus. &#34;Is her name Rylie Kirk? She&#39;s enrolled at the medical university,isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Kendrick admitted, only to catch himself. &#34;Wait, you already tracked her down? Why would you go ahead and find her before I&#39;d even arranged a proper welcome?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For an Owen, bringing a lost family member home was an occasion for the grandest reception. Marcus understood this tradition perfectly and quickly covered his tracks. &#34;Until you told me, I wasn&#39;t sure if she is an Owen, so l didn&#39;t tell her anything about this. I did learn, though, that she&#39;s somehow tied to the Dury family through an engagement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick&#39;s initialjoy turned to disbelief, his voice rising. &#34;You&#39;re telling me she is engaged to that fool from the Dury family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Felix happened to be resting in his hospital bed as Kendrick spoke. Hearing the commotion, Felix chimed in, &#34;From what I know,there&#39;s been a strong alliance between the Kirk and Dury families. When I heard about my sister&#39;s engagement, I gave the Dury family hundreds of millions to support their Crolens project as a wedding gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; response was grave. &#34;The gesture was wasted. The Dury family doesn&#39;t see her worth.They&#39;re planning to call off the engagement-claiming she&#39;s not good enough for them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt and outrage mingled in Kendrick&#39;s chest. &#34;How dare they! Who are they to look down on my granddaughter? Marrying into the Dury family would be a disgrace for someone of her standing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s face tightened with frustration. &#34;That was not the outcome I wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With quiet conviction, Marcus added, &#34;Having met her, I can say with certainty - she&#39;s anything but worthless. Rylie&#39;s talent speaks for itself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s tone hardened. &#34;No one gets to trample on the Owen family. If the Dury family can&#39;t recognize her value, there&#39;s no need for us to continue any partnership with them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time flew by, and before long, the Kirk residence bustled with anticipation for the upcoming banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Kirk family pulled out all the stops, extending invitations to a throng of reporters in honor of Stacey&#39;s homecoming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A picture of familial bliss seemed to fill the room-at least, for everyone but Nicolas, who was lying in the hospital bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey shifted uneasily in her seat. &#34;It&#39;s such a shame Nicolas couldn&#39;t be here,&#34; she murmured, a note of regret in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother, Tessa Kirk, gently brushed her hair from her forehead, her tone soft but edged with disappointment. &#34;I could never have predicted, after raising Rylie for so long, that she would end up harming her own brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Stacey&#39;s father, Casper Kirk, spoke,his voice carrying a colder weight. &#34;You can take a child out of poverty, but you can&#39;t take the poverty out of the child. Frankly, we&#39;ve shown restraint by not pressing charges against her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s eyes lingered on his parents. Watching them rally behind Stacey, he opened his mouth as if to protest-then simply let the words die on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shout broke the tension. &#34;Rylie&#39;s arrived!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes turned toward the entrance, anticipation crackling in the air. The crowd parted, but instead of a poised debutante in formalwear, an unexpected sound cut through the chatter - a motorcycle&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>deep-throated growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A matte-black bike tore into view, tires spinning into a dramatic stop just outside the banquet hall. Every head craned for a better look as Rylie coolly dismounted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She removed her helmet, ran a hand through her wild hair, and strode forward - her black leather jacket and tailored pants setting her apart in a sea of gowns and tuxedos. That sharp pop of color on her lips,paired with her striking features, left more than a few young men momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentlemen present, accustomed to the delicate manners of society&#39;s finest daughters, found themselves riveted. Here stood a woman who owned both elegance and defiance in every gesture,radiating a confidence that set her apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred, moments away from making the breakup official, found his attention completely captured by Rylie&#39;s entrance. He stared, caught off guard, until Stacey pinched his arm hard enough to snap him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Fred pasted on a reassuring smile for Stacey, but his mind was elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone remembered Rylie as the girl who hid beneath oversized sweatshirts. But tonight, she had shattered that image entirely - taking their breath away as she claimed the room for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie climbed the grand staircase, her leather jacket and fitted pants drawing every gaze in the hall-she was an undeniable outlier among the crowd of polished socialites. She nonchalantly blew a bubble with her gum, strolled right up to the Kirk family,and said, &#34;I&#39;ll only be a couple of minutes. I need to grab something from upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she turned on her heel and disappeared into her old bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s composure snapped as she watched Rylie&#39;s retreating figure. &#34;Just look at her outfit! This is the night Stacey&#39;s recognized as our daughter, and Rylie can&#39;t even pretend to act with dignity!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Phillip&#39;s focus wasn&#39;t on her clothes. He was squinting out the window at the motorcycle parked by the entrance, his voice sharp with suspicion.&#34;She&#39;s going too far these days. Where on earth did she get the money for a bike like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland interjected, brow furrowing in warning,&#34;Enough, Phillip. This isn&#39;t the time for wild accusations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip bristled, refusing to back down. &#34;You clearly don&#39;t get it. That bike outside? It&#39;s a rare model -costs at least two million. Since she&#39;s no longer with the family, I&#39;d like to know what trick she pulled to afford it.&#34;</p>
