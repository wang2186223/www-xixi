                <p>To keep his identity hidden, Sean had wrapped his face tightly, making it nearly impossible for everyone to recognize him during the examination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I overheard every word from the consultation room,&#34;said Sean. He stood tall, voice steady and eyes sharp. &#34;HaloFlow Pharmacy has earned first place,no question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell quiet. One doctor, who had been the loudest critic, suddenly had nothing to say. Evita&#39;s face turned pale, then red. Her head stayed low.Sean&#39;s reveal left no doubt - her skills had been outmatched too quickly by someone that she had dismissed. Nobody had imagined that the third patient would be Sean himself, playing sick. Evita couldn&#39;t afford to let someone whom she looked down on destroy everything that she had worked for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes darted around. Now that the Wilde family was blacklisted by Healing Hand and had a bad reputation on the dark web, they were struggling. If they couldn&#39;t secure Brad&#39;s chief physician rights today,it was all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Marsha a subtle signal. Marsha raised her voice at once. &#34;HaloFlow stole our family&#39;s formula.They used it to save Mr. Brad Morgan at a crucial time! That wasn&#39;t help - that was theft. The Wilde family has never lost a patient. We&#39;ve always practiced medicine with integrity. How can you trust someone who snuck their way to the top?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie stepped up, her tone sharp and cool. &#34;Funny. Is there any proof that Selah was involved in a setup back when that patient died? Who&#39;s really the fraud here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita scoffed, shaking her head,&#34;We have the proof.Selah&#39;s selfish mistake cost a life. The case was reviewed thoroughly. You&#39;ve been misled. Still, if you hand over the formula, I won&#39;t press charges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charges?&#34; Rylie looked at the clock, then passed her phone to Evita, smirking. &#34;Go on. Call them. I&#39;d be honored.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Evita sputtered. &#34;You think I won&#39;t? If you weren&#39;t Brad&#39;s physician, I&#39;d have had you locked up already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No call yet?&#34; Without hesitation, Rylie snatched her phone back, dialed the number herself, and lifted it to her ear. &#34;Let me help. I&#39;ll call the police to come get me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone watched in stunned silence. Who would call the police on themselves? What exactly was Rylie planning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Evita couldn&#39;t make sense of what Rylie was doing.Meanwhile, Marsha kept pressing forward.&#34;Go ahead and call them,&#34; she snapped. &#34;That formula you stole is worth hundreds of millions. You&#39;ll be rotting in prison before long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rylie&#39;s out of her mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does she think being Brad&#39;s chief physician means she can do whatever she wants?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They really need to rethink trusting someone like her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmurs picked up again. This time, most voices leaned toward the Wildes. And just as the room swelled with noise, the clock struck two. Sirens echoed in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie lowered her eyes and smiled. &#34;Right on time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, police cars pulled directly onto the estate lawn. Everyone inside the hall turned toward the windows, watching as officers in black tactical gear stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she seriously call them?&#34; someone whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that was so fast! She just made the call!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps turned into whispers, then full-blown chatter.If Rylie was dragged out now, the seat as Brad&#39;s physician would be back up for grabs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Marsha looked thrilled. She leaned toward Rylie and mouthed, &#34;You just ruined yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front doors swung open. A tall officer marched in, gaze firm, shoulders squared. The room tensed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke. They waited for him to name Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Evita Wilde. Miss Marsha Wilde,&#34; the officer said clearly,voice firm and steady. &#34;We&#39;re with the Economic Crime Investigation Division, Special Action Unit. You&#39;re both under arrest for medical fraud and illegal practice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita froze. Her voice barely made it out. &#34;There&#39;s a mistake.You must be confused.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officer pulled out a warrant. His tone didn&#39;t shift.&#34;Over the past five years, VitaLink Hospital has racked up three hundred cases of medical fraud,totaling over two hundred million in damages.We have evidence showing those crimes were carried out under your direction. The Wilde family has sold organs, taken bribes, performed surgeries without cause, committed academic fraud, and framed fellow doctors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha grabbed Evita&#39;s arm in panic. &#34;Grandma, this can&#39;t be happening. We&#39;ve already-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quiet!&#34; snapped Evita. &#34;This is nonsense. Our hospital&#39;s always been honest. We&#39;ve never cheated a patient-not even for a cent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the officers stepped forward with cuffs in hand. &#34;You&#39;ll need to come with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I want a lawyer! I&#39;m not going!&#34; Marsha&#39;s voice cracked. But she didn&#39;t get far. A tall officer forced her to the floor, cuffed her without hesitation, and led her out in disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever plan she had to win over Brad with her credentials had completely collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was frozen. Not a single person moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police, expected to arrest Rylie, had instead removed two Wildes. Even Leland - still employed by VitaLink and closely tied to Marsha-was brought in for questioning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just a doctor,&#34; he protested, raising his voice.&#34;VitaLink hired me. I don&#39;t know anything about what the Wilde family&#39;s doing! Why are you taking me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer our questions and you&#39;ll be fine. If you&#39;ve done nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland turned to Rylie, panic rising. &#34;My sister and I are supposed to help treat Mr. Brad Morgan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll manage without you,&#34; Rylie said, her voice flat.&#34;Maybe you should start thinking about your own mistakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face didn&#39;t change. She looked as if everything that had happened had gone exactly how she planned it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a room full of experts, Rylie had dragged the Wilde family&#39;s secrets into the light- and brought both them and VitaLink Hospital crashing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s chest tightened with regret. He&#39;d known that things weren&#39;t right. He&#39;d seen mismatches between the diagnoses and the operations he performed. The hospital had been cutting corners-and worse-but he said nothing. Now he was being taken too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was gone, silence finally settled over the hall. No one spoke. The fear lingered. If the Wildes had gone down, who else might fall with them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then someone broke the quiet. &#34;Check your phones!&#34; a voice called out.</p>
