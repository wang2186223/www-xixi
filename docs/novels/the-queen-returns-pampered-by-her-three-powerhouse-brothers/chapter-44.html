                <p>Tessa barely let the suspicion cross her mind before brushing it aside. &#34;Her status above ours? No chance.She must have found herself some sugar daddy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll call Fred-he might know what&#39;s really going on,&#34;Stacey said,already fishing her phone from her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could place the call, the mall&#39;s loudspeakers crackled to life: &#34;Attention all shoppers.Effective immediately, Vantage Mall will be closed to the public for the exclusive use of the Owen family&#39;s honored daughter. All shops are to suspend business for the next two hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Stacey jerked her head up in disbelief.All around them, the mall&#39;s lights flickered off, leaving only the Beedleshine boutique aglow beneath a single,stark spotlight. A dozen of black-suited bodyguards assembled,forming a barrier to keep out prying eyes as they guided a young woman from the store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s voice trembled. &#34;What... what is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sick feeling took hold of Stacey. &#34;It couldn&#39;t actually be Rylie, could it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s ridiculous,&#34; Tessa retorted. &#34;There were other girls in there, and Rylie&#39;s just some country bumpkin.She couldn&#39;t possibly be that important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, a cluster of frustrated young women from wealthy families was also being hustled toward the exits. Paola&#39;s face had gone pale, and her friend shouted furiously at security, &#34;You&#39;re out of your minds! Paola&#39;s an Owen too! How dare you treat us like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security team exchanged a look,then one of them made a quick call and returned with a stiff apology.&#34;Sorry, but the directive is clear. The entire mall is reserved for the Owen family&#39;s only daughter. No exceptions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella clung to Paola&#39;s arm, her eyes flashing. &#34;This is insane! Paola, you&#39;re an Owen, aren&#39;t you? There&#39;s no way they&#39;d go to all this trouble for that nobody.They must have meant you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola couldn&#39;t even fake a smile. &#34;Let me make a call,&#34;she said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slipping away from her circle, she dialed Deandre and laid out the whole situation. His apology was little more than an afterthought. &#34;Sorry, Paola. I just wanted Rylie to have the run of the mall today. It honestly slipped my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest tightened, but she forced her voice to stay pleasant. &#34;I don&#39;t mind being shown the door, but do you think you could let my friends shop? That&#39;s all l ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre replied,&#34;Got it. You can all join Rylie. Have fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, leaving Paola simmering with jealousy that she tried to hide. Despite being just from a distant branch of the Owen family, she had always counted herself as the Owen family&#39;s cherished daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way this outsider, Rylie, could take her place. Paola would make sure that everyone knew who the Owen family&#39;s real daughter was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she returned, the bodyguards,now briefed with new instructions, changed their tune and courteously ushered her group back inside. That move salvaged her standing-her friends never doubted her claim of being an Owen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, trouble brewed. Casper hadn&#39;t set foot outside his office in days, barricading himself from the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s chronic leg pain had flared up badly, and a nasty reaction to her medication landed her at VitaLink Hospital. Stacey was left behind at home,nerves on edge for reasons that she couldn&#39;t quite explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicolas was bedridden and unable to run the family&#39;s affairs. Leland spent his days in the hospital,his nights at the company-his energy drained, his hair graying faster than ever. Phillip was nowhere to be found;rumors said that the fiasco with his racing team had him barely keeping it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Rylie&#39;s departure from the Kirk family,nothing had been the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That afternoon, as usual, a servant prepared a homemade meal and delivered it to Tessa&#39;s hospital room. Leland stood beside her bed, medical chart in hand, his expression grim. &#34;The latest round of tests shows your legs&#39; condition hasn&#39;t improved. In fact,it&#39;s gotten worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All color was drained from Tessa&#39;s face. &#34;That&#39;s impossible. Stacey went to the Wilde family&#39;s famous doctor for my medicine, and she&#39;s been massaging my legs every day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the name &#34;Wilde family&#34; made Leland&#39;s face tighten with frustration. Ever since Nicolas&#39; sudden decline, his trust in their so-called experts had evaporated. None of Marsha&#39;s remedies had made the  slightest difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now, stick to the painkillers and stop using anything Stacey picked up from Marsha,&#34; he suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa clung to the hope of good news. &#34;And Nicolas?Has he improved at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland let out a weary sigh and shook his head. &#34;His legs&#39; nerves have shut down. At this point, the only option doctors are recommending is amputation, to keep it from getting any worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa felt the world drop out from beneath her. Her voice pitched upward. &#34;Amputation? Are you serious?How could it possibly come to this? Before we came back, Nicolas promised me he was fine-he could walk, run, even manage the business. He was in perfect health!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence hung in the air before Leland finally spoke.&#34;That was true-up until Rylie was forced out.&#34;</p>
