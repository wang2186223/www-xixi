                <p>Deandre&#39;s gaze lingered on Rylie, catching the distant look in her eyes. &#34;Hey, Rylie, what&#39;s on your mind? You seem a little lost,&#34; he asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft blink brought Rylie back, and she managed a small smile. &#34;Oh, it&#39;s nothing really. I just can&#39;t help worrying about your safety. You&#39;re always in harm&#39;s way. Maybe it&#39;s time you had more people around you for protection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the genuine concern in her voice seemed to lift Felix&#39;s spirits. He grinned with a hnt of swagger.&#34;You don&#39;t have to stress about me. I&#39;m tougher than I look. Even Brad can&#39;t outmatch me-I promise you,I can hold my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a quick nod, but deep down, she wasn&#39;t convinced. In her mind, she resolved to have a few people track the Costa Syndicate and quietly bolster Deandre&#39;s security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding someone who truly cared for her was a rarity,and she wasn&#39;t about to let anything threaten her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, the entire Owen family gathered to celebrate Rylie&#39;s return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every inch of the dining table was filled with dishes from across the country, each one more tempting than the last. Kendrick motioned for her to sit by his side, his tone warm. &#34;Come, Rylie. See if there&#39;s something you like. If not, just say the word and I&#39;ll have the kitchen whip up anything you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reassured him easily, &#34;Honestly, I&#39;m not picky-everything looks great.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sipped her soup and couldn&#39;t help but appreciate how flavorful it was, but Laurel&#39;s sharp voice interrupted the calm. &#34;Percy, how many times must I remind you not to make noise when you eat?Look at Paola.Learn some manners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy responded, &#34;Alright, I get it. I&#39;ll eat like a civilized person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cast a sideways glance at Rylie as he said it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Rylie&#39;s spoon tapped softly against her bowl just as Paola glanced over. Instantly, Paola straightened, perfecting her posture, sipping her soup with a kind of practiced grace that belonged in etiquette books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie watched, amused. Paola truly knew how to play the part. Sure, Rylie could do it too if she wanted-but there were better ways to spend her evening than obsessing over such unnecessary table manners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wasted the whole night pretending to be a proper lady, she&#39;d end up missing out on tonight&#39;s racing event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the tension, Deandre quickly tried to break it. He grabbed his soup bowl and finished it off in a single gulp, then set it down a little too loudly, pulling a face. &#34;We&#39;re family. It&#39;s just dinner- let&#39;s keep it real,yeah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Awkwardness crept into Laurel&#39;s features, though  she couldn&#39;t really argue against Deandre. &#34;You&#39;re right, Deandre. I guess l&#39;ve just always been strict with my own children. I&#39;ve always asked them to be cultured all the time and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre retorted, &#34;So now, just because my bowl made a sound, I&#39;m uncultured? Please. All these manners make me itch.&#34; Years spent running wild among rough company had left him immune to fake decorum- and he didn&#39;t want to see Rylie boxed in by such nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave Rylie&#39;s shoulder a reassuring pat. &#34;Let my sister eat however she wants. She&#39;s fine just the way she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That statement seemed to rattle Paola. Her perfect posture and elegant manner suddenly felt awkward,out of place at a table where realness mattered more than etiquette. Even though Deandre and his brothers had always been the picture of politeness,everything changed when it came to Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Kendrick tipped back his bowl and finished his soup with gusto, then wiped his mouth on his sleeve, not caring who noticed. &#34;Back when l was young,whether I was working the fields or fixing engines for a few coins, I never cared about how l ate. Food tasted best when you just dug in. Life&#39;s gotten complicated...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze wandered over the table&#39;s perfect arrangements. &#34;All these rules, and I still end up half-hungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix tried to defuse things with a gentle sigh.&#34;Grandpa, just eat how you like. Being comfortable is the important part.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie felt warmth settle over her, knowing that her grandfather and brothers were on her side. She dropped her gaze and dug in, finally able to enjoy the meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a fond smile, Kendrick looked at Rylie and addressed Paola directly. &#34;Paola, don&#39;t get too hung up on manners. There&#39;s nothing wrong with having a healthy appetite, just like Rylie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola forced a polite smile, her hand gripping the fork tightly. Suddenly, all that pride she felt for her perfect table manners felt hollow and out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell over the room asthe doors swung open and a servant entered, saying, &#34;The Morgan family has sent a gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement flickered in Paola&#39;s eyes as she set her fork aside. &#34;Is it from Brad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy chimed in, teasing, &#34;I bet it&#39;s for you, especially since you&#39;re working on Spencer&#39;s new film score.Brad probably wanted to send something special.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint blush spread across Paola&#39;s cheeks. Brad,the boy next door, had always been her secret admiration - handsome, successful, the kind everyone noticed. Yet he rarely visited,and whenever he did, it was only for something important. Paola could only wish for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle laugh escaped Laurel as she chimed in,&#34;Just the other day, your father mentioned you to Brad. This is probably his way of saying congratulations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement bubbled in Paola as she carefully dried her hands and got to her feet. Trying to hide her eagerness, she turned to the servant. &#34;What did Brad send?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping aside, the servant signaled for a second attendant to wheel in a cart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps filled the room when the towering eight-layer cake appeared, each tier more ornate than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perplexity furrowed Deandre&#39;s brow. &#34;Why would Brad send a massive cake just for Paola?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though confusion flickered across Paola&#39;s face, she didn&#39;t let it diminish her happiness. After all, it was the first present Brad had ever sent her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy explained, &#34;Brad&#39;s always off somewhere and probably has no clue what girls really like. He must have figured a fancy cake was a safe bet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel broke into another warm chuckle. &#34;It&#39;s a lovely gesture regardless. The decoration is so elaborate, it must have come from that top-tier bakery downtown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And a cake of this size can&#39;t have been cheap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola picked up the cake knife, ready to make the first cut, when the servant suddenly paused as if remembering something important. She hurried forward and fished two envelopes from her apron,looking flustered. &#34;Forgive me, I nearly forgot. Mr.Morgan wrote two personal letters - one for Mr.Kendrick Owen and...&#34;</p>
