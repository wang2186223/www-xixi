                <p>Rylie&#39;s and Brad&#39;s faces drew so near that their cheeks brushed, breaths mingling in the hush between them.When their eyes met, she caught an unshakeable steadiness in his gaze - a cool assurance that revealed he&#39;d already guessed about the assassins.Not a flicker of surprise touched his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting her hand drop, Rylie spoke. &#34;You already knew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad,still slightly hunched from her tug, kept his voice level. &#34;That&#39;s just a soldier&#39;s instinct. But you, Dr.Owen, I&#39;d say you&#39;re just as sharp. Did the Kirk brothers drill this into you, or is it all you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s tension melted as she realized that he truly had everything under control. &#34;My family never taught me a thing. All of this is simply my own nature-sharp-eyed since birth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s mouth curved into a half-smile as he looked down at her. &#34;No one&#39;s ever doubted your brilliance.And I noticed your concern for me, that&#39;s why you rushed in despite the risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyebrow arched, Rylie studied his strikingly handsome features and, on a whim, reached out and pinched his chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had there been any witnesses in the room, they&#39;d have been startled by her audacity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie was testing the limits between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Brad stayed still, the subtle tension in his frame betrayed a side rarely seen beneath his composed exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked softly, &#34;Did I guess wrong?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her thumb idly tracing the line of his jaw, Rylie answered in a cool, quiet voice, &#34;Given your health and position, you really have no business at these tiresome, low-rent charity galas. Why would the famous admiral suddenly take an interest in jewelry for debutantes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped, her eyes lifting to meet his.&#34;Brad,you&#39;re here for me, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All traces of distant formality had vanished from her voice - what remained was a playful, grown-up boldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could answer, the door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock entered,hauling a corpse, and said, &#34;Mr. Morgan,it&#39;s done...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock&#39;s words died in his throat, eyes going round with shock. He&#39;d been busy clearing the grounds of assassins - only to return and find Rylie pinching Brad&#39;s chin, lost in a charged moment together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Rylie glanced over her shoulder, Brad&#39;s gaze trailed after her. Brock took the cue to beat a quick retreat, backing out and stammering, &#34;Sorry, sorry, I&#39;ll let you two carry on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie let go of Brad&#39;s chin and stepped back, her subtle fragrance slipping away, leaving Brad with a faint sense of loss that he didn&#39;t care to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like your people have things under control,&#34;she remarked, already moving for the door. &#34;I&#39;ll head out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad straightened, smoothing his jacket before following her to the exit. &#34;Let me walk you out. The rest of this auction isn&#39;t worth sticking around for.The real entertainment&#39;s over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie slipped out the door, passing Brockas he quietly dealt with the last of the clean-up-his practiced efficiency clear in every move. There must have been no shortage of people hoping for Brad&#39;s demise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother asking who had put out the latest  hit. Still, as they descended the stairs together, Brad offered the explanation with the casual air of someone chatting about the weather. &#34;There&#39;s been a recent oil discovery just offshore. Owhea wants in,so their navy&#39;s been running exercises close by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s brow creased as she recalled the headline. &#34;I remember seeing something about that. Didn&#39;t our fleet run drills as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad let out a quiet laugh, adjusting his cufflinks.&#34;That was my command.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone shifted, a cold edge sharpening his words.&#34;One of Owhea&#39;s surveillance planes wandered too close and got shot down. They&#39;ve been seething about it ever since.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie arched a brow, her curiosity piqued. &#34;So these assassins were sent by Owhea?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Odds are high their intelligence service is behind this,&#34;Brad replied evenly, as if he were reciting stock prices.&#34;They&#39;re fond of shadow games like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking back over Brad&#39;s headline-making career,Rylie chuckled. &#34;You&#39;ve eliminated more than a few of their operatives since you took command-and you manage to do it all in the name of duty. Not much they can say about it, can they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of her laughter, Brad found himself distracted. Her smile had a way of outshining everything around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his lingering look, Rylie touched her cheek in confusion. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad halted beside her, then reached up to gently remove a fallen blossom from her hair. &#34;Just the wind,&#34;he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie faltered for half a second,awkwardly lowering her hand. &#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two stepped out into the corridor. The suspicious waiter she&#39;d clocked earlier had long since vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, inside the hall, Paola scoured the crowd for Rylie. She finally caught a glimpse of her leaving through a side door, accompanied by a tall man she didn&#39;t recognize.Who could he be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola turned to Johnny, who was already rising from his seat, clearly bored. &#34;If Miss Owen has lost interest in the jewelry, then it really must be dull tonight. Paola,I&#39;m heading out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick to react, Paola stood as well and whispered, &#34;I just spotted Rylie leaving with a gentleman. No sense staying here either. Johnny, mind giving me a lift?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny raised an eyebrow. &#34;Didn&#39;t you come with your driver? Wasn&#39;t it your delay with the car that made Rylie late to begin with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s bluntness caught Paola off guard, making her look down in embarrassment. &#34;I wasn&#39;t trying to make things difficult. Are you blaming me too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny shook his head. &#34;That&#39;s not it. Just a reminder to be considerate next time. Working late isn&#39;t an excuse to keep people waiting.&#34; He saw straight through Paola&#39;s intentions - she was never just thoughtless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly uninterested in further entanglement,Johnny simply said, &#34;I&#39;m heading out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole evening had left Paola simmering with frustration. Not only had she failed to embarrass Rylie,but she also became the one to be humiliated in front of every guest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in her room, she flung her pillow onto the bed and exclaimed, &#34;She&#39;s so infuriating! Always playing the innocent, and everyone falls for it. How does she manage to show up and eclipse me every single time?&#34;Percy stood by the door, watching his sister&#39;s wounded pride with a troubled frown, his own sense of injustice growing on her behalf...</p>
