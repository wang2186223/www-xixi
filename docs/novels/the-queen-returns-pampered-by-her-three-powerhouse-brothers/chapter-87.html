                <p>Rylie had a rare talent for reading the human body and predicting motion. One glance at the alleyway and surrounding road was enough. She veered off toward a narrow lane up ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hit the brakes at a sharp turn and caught sight of a scuff mark on the right wall. It was faint but recent.Clearly, a car had left its mark. Smirking, she followed the trail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely three minutes passed before she trapped the vehicle in a cul-de-sac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than surrender, the driver floored the gas. The van surged forward, heading straight for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He figured she&#39;d panic and jump out of the way. Thatillusion shattered when she drew a pistol with practiced ease, flicked off the safety, and raised it-aimed straight at the windshield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tires screamed. The vehicle jolted to a stop, just a yard from where she stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open, and the&#34;old beggar&#34; stepped out. Looking at Rylie, he laughed, his voice turning unexpectedly young this time. &#34;So the Owen girl&#39;s this sharp. Didn&#39;t think anyone out there could track me down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie recognized the voice at once. Gun lowered, she asked, &#34;How much did Laurel offer you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man yanked the synthetic layer off his face, stunned by how closely her voice matched his employer&#39;s.&#34;Who are you?&#34; he asked cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t answer; instead, she extended her palm. &#34;Give me the phone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his mind hadn&#39;t caught up yet, his body obeyed. Devin Finch walked over, eyes still wide,and handed over the stolen device without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Devin&#39;s face shifted. His eyes widened as he stared. &#34;You&#39;re the Healing Hand!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization rattled him. Only one person could activate the signal embedded in his system. It dawned on him all at once. The woman he was assigned to tail-the newly returned daughter of the Owen family-was none other than his superior. And she looked like she hadn&#39;t even graduated yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie wasn&#39;t surprised by the delay in his recognition. Devin and his crew worked overseas and had never seen her real face. Unless she called, they never showed up. Therefore, Rylie guessed that Laurel must have paid a steep price to get his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned against the hood, idly weighing the phone in her hand. &#34;What&#39;s her plan for this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Devin didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;She asked me to extract the security footage, edit it, and make it seem like you doctored the clip of Paola&#39;s theft. She wants it to look like a setup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie broke into laughter. &#34;That explains the melodrama back at the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at her, clearly still reeling. &#34;Are you really the Healing Hand? That&#39;s true, isn&#39;tit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I said no, would it even matter?&#34; she replied coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Devin gave a slow shake of his head. &#34;None of us ever imagined you&#39;d be this young. Britton never said a word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To most, anyone running such massive operations-a medical conglomerate, a tech empire, and a weapons manufacturer-should look the part. A middle-aged man, maybe. Someone intimidating, or at least severe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Devin saw instead left him speechless. The legendary &#34;Healing Hand&#34; turned out to be a young woman in her twenties, born into one of the most prominent families in Crolens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept sneaking glances her way. There she was, leaning casually against a motorcycle. Her fingers spun the phone around like a toy. If he didn&#39;t know better, he would have guessed she was just a college student killing time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you keep looking?&#34; she asked with a slight smirk. &#34;Were you expecting someone different?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, not at all,&#34; said Devin, shaking his head quickly. &#34;Just... caught off guard, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short pause, he said, &#34;So Britton never told us who you really were because-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was light, but her words were sharp. &#34;Because if a crew like yours found out the &#39;Healing Hand&#39;was just some girl, you would&#39;ve stopped listening long ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when she first stepped in, the chip technology she&#39;d created hadn&#39;t been stable. She couldn&#39;t risk exposure, so Britton kept her hidden. She hadn&#39;t expected him to guard her identity so fiercely that none of them ever saw her face. But that had been then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,her technology was well-developed, and it was already impossible for them to betray her. They&#39;d have to either be loyal to her or commit suicide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Devin shifted topics. &#34;Laurel offered me eight million and told me to spread her story as if it were real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s brow lifted slightly. &#34;She&#39;s awfully generous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a few seconds, then said, &#34;Maybe it&#39;s because your grandfather plans to leave Serenity Manor to you. And Detour Inc too. It used to be under Terrance&#39;s care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed off the motorcycle at once, expression sharpening. &#34;Who told you that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scratching the back of his head, Devin answered, &#34;LaureI doesn&#39;t trust anyone. I&#39;ve had a listening device hidden in her room for years. I check in now and then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught Rylie off guard. A small laugh escaped. &#34;Well. That clears that up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Devin glanced sideways, almost embarrassed. &#34;So... does this count as fixing what I messed up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when the incident with the maritime weapons broke out, every team was out on assignment. According to the rules, Devin shouldn&#39;t have taken on freelance work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wiped the smile from her face and replied with a straight tone, &#34;All the money you made will be seized.It&#39;ll be split among those still grinding in the field.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a firm nod. That wasn&#39;t even close to harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure they&#39;re looked after,&#34; he said. &#34;Should I stay out of Laurel&#39;s way now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she answered. &#34;Go ahead and finish the job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie was well aware that upon returning to the Owen family, she was under countless watchful eyes. Her image,which had been deliberately tarnished by Stacey in the Kirk family, still lingered in their minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to prove them wrong. Every single one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Paola repeatedly sought confrontation, Rylie didn&#39;t think there was any need for her to show mercy time and again. Paola wanted to use her as a stepping stone? That would be her gravest mistake.</p>
