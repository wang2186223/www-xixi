                <p>Marcus caught sight of something that startled him, and he almost let the microphone slip from his hand.The sharp sound that followed drew everyone&#39;s attention. He no longer wore the calm look of a composed gentleman. Instead, his face had darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who told you to sit beside that man?&#34; said Marcus, voice clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes met Rylie&#39;s, catching her off guard. She blinked slowly and said, &#34;Paola told me that seat was meant for your guest, so she wouldn&#39;t let me sit there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice remained quiet, but Marcus had sharp hearing. He didn&#39;t miss a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He faced the crowd and spoke straight into the mic. &#34;That seat is yours. You are the guest I invited. I left a box of snacks beside the sofa just for you. Go back. Don&#39;t sit with any man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his tone wasn&#39;t exactly harsh, his meaning was clear. The crowd picked up on it right away. His jealousy wasn&#39;t fiery. It sounded more like the scolding of an older brother who spoiled his sibling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t argue. She stood, left Brad&#39;s side, and made her way to the sofa that Marcus had pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down and opened the small box beside her. Inside were a few slices of cake and an assortment of juices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Marcus saw her back in the seat he&#39;d chosen for her, his expression eased. He gave a soft laugh and said, &#34;My sister always finds a way to stir things up. I hope she didn&#39;t bother anyone too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adjusted his bow tie and returned to the piano.&#34;Let&#39;s begin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The music that followed was beautiful, but the women who had mocked Rylie earlier didn&#39;t hear a single note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word of what had happened had already spread through the room. The whole exchange had been seen by too many, and now it was clear. Those elegant young women had formed a circle with the intent to isolate Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was this close to scolding Rylie. I thought she stole the seat,&#34;someone whispered. &#34;Turns out Paola made a mistake from the beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another voice followed. &#34;She jumped in without even asking what was going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the back, a fan of Brad&#39;s chimed in, &#34;So the seat was indeed for him. He just helped her out by saying it belongs to her. He&#39;s such a gentleman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s expression had gone pale, though she stayed mostly in the shadows. She spoke softly. &#34;I didn&#39;t know there&#39;d be such a mix-up. No one told me Rylie was the guest Marcus mentioned. I truly misunderstood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella stepped in, quick to defend her. &#34;How was that a misunderstanding? Rylie should have explained herself properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One woman muttered, &#34;You didn&#39;t even give Rylie a chance. You all jumped in like you knew everything.&#34;Another voice joined in, firm but calm. Fiona had been silent until now. She had always felt unsure of Rylie&#39;s place in the Owen family, but things had changed. The way all three brothers treated her made it obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella snapped her head around. &#34;So now you&#39;re defending her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola, too, was surprised that Fiona, who had always been close to her, suddenly defended Rylie. Shebit her lip and said pitifully, &#34;Alright, Isabella, let&#39;s not argue, okay? Let&#39;s not miss Marcus&#39; solo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room settled once more. Rylie glanced toward Fiona, her face unreadable. Fiona returned the look with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a nod and turned her attention back to the music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; playing was something she held in high regard. The piece he composed just for her fell over the hall like soft moonlight. Each note carried the feeling of something precious returned. The crowd below was equally spellbound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the final note faded, the audience burst into thunderous applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus glanced toward her, his expression filled with quiet warmth. Her heart stirred at the sight, and her lips curved in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He returned to the keys and played several familiar pieces, carrying the concert toward the break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the music paused, Marcus stepped forward. Thelights shifted, casting a glow over Paola. He extended a hand to her and said, &#34;My cousin will be performing her newest piece during the intermission.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the back, Spencer clapped his hands and whispered,&#34;It&#39;s finally here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola raised her gown slightly and passed by Rylie like a crowned royal. The light she carried brushed over Rylie before pulling away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took Marcus&#39; hand and stepped up with ease, offering a graceful bow. Her poise and beauty drew quiet admiration from those watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She really looks like someone born for this. The rest can&#39;t compare,&#34; someone whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her skirt, Paola turned to the crowd and greeted them. As the clapping died down, she began to speak. &#34;Tonight&#39;s piece is the theme for Director Spencer Aguilar&#39;s upcoming film, Twilight Horizon. Being able to debut it here at Marcus&#39; recital is a tremendous privilege. Director Aguilar holds hismusic to the highest standard. Each note is refined to near perfection...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes drifted to Marcus as she continued, &#34;Still, my greatest thanks go to my cousin, Marcus. He taught me from an early age that true music must come from within.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a playful wink. &#34;I may not be on his level, but standing here tonight is already more than enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her speech left no room for reproach. She praised the film, complimented Spencer, and reminded everyone of her ties to Marcus-all with one performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie leaned to one side, resting her chin on her hand. As soon as Paola struck the first note, her gaze sharpened.Her lips lifted into a smirk. This fool had stepped into the trap with both feet. And now she had the gall to perform stolen music in front of all these people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the piece continued, Rylie tapped her fingers lightly against the armrest. When the third measure came,she froze. This was it.</p>
