                <p>A wry smirk tugged at Brad&#39;s lips. &#34;Is that so?Remarkable that even a so-called genius like Marsha overlooked the detoxification process for high-purity Nexo-7. With that level of oversight, I&#39;d hesitate to put the care of any important guest in your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended the call before Evita could protest, fixing Marsha with an unreadable stare. &#34;What you declared is contrary to your grandmother&#39;s words.Tell me, Dr. Wilde, do you claim to surpass her expertise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie couldn&#39;t hide her satisfaction; nothing was sweeter than watching the Wilde family unravel their own shining star&#39;s reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Marsha&#39;s flush of humiliation and the sudden humility from Leland, Rylie taunted, her smile widening, &#34;Or maybe Marsha really is that gifted,after all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trapped between loyalty to her grandmother and the sting of public embarrassment, Marsha had no choice but to bow her head. &#34;I was mistaken, Mr.Morgan. The Nexo-7 serum is extremely rare, and only Aetheris Pharmacy pharmacists are fully versed in its dangers. But Felix&#39;s case is unrelated - I can handle his care, if you&#39;d allow me another opportunity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad showed no interest in further debate. He turned toward Rylie. &#34;Back at school, you rescued Felix after a pneumothorax. Recent tests uncovered some complications. Would you be willing to examine him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s face drifted through Rylie&#39;s memory-faintly familiar, but not enough for her to rush in. &#34;If his condition isn&#39;t too complex, the military hospital surgeons can take over. They&#39;re highly competent.There&#39;s no need for me to intervene unless it&#39;s urgent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t press her, accepting her answer with a nod.&#34;Very well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Brad tossed the fake serum into a nearby trash can, his glare cold as it landed on Leland. &#34;It seems the Kirk and Wilde families are experts only in deception.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha&#39;s legs buckled; she grabbed the wall to steady herself, her voice pleading. &#34;Mr. Morgan, the Wilde family&#39;s reputation is real! We&#39;ve all been duped by Stacey. I&#39;Il have my grandmother personally oversee your Nexo-7 next time -at the next conference, I&#39;ll deliver it myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Brad stepped into the elevator alongside Rylie, not bothering to look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland was left completely bewildered. What hold did Rylie have over Brad that he would follow her lead so obediently? How had things turned upside down between them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey, blindsided by the abrupt reversal, barely registered what had happened before Vivian&#39;s hand cracked across her cheek. &#34;If you weren&#39;t up to the task, you should have spoken up! Fabricating Nexo-7-do you have any idea how much trouble you&#39;ve brought down on us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears spilled down Stacey&#39;s cheeks. &#34;Dr. Estrada, I&#39;m sorry, I never meant-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian interjected coldly, &#34;No more excuses! Every opportunity | promised you is gone.&#34; She shoved Stacey aside. &#34;Clear out your things. You&#39;re finished in my research group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha wasn&#39;t about to show any sympathy either.She shot Leland a scornful look and scoffed, &#34;Some brother you turned out to be! You let your sister offend the Morgan family. The Kirk name is finished -watch how far you all fall!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the uproar faded and the crowd dispersed,Leland cornered Stacey in the sterile hallway,his anger cold and unforgiving. &#34;Where was your head,Stacey? You went and manufactured fake Nexo-7, of all things! That&#39;s the Morgan family you almost crossed-the very people who hold sway over this entire city! Even the President shows them respect.If your counterfeit serum had ended up in Mr. Morgan,do you realize how catastrophic it would&#39;ve been?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just imagining the Kirk family&#39;s ruin sent chills down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jabbed a finger at her, voice sharp. &#34;I&#39;ve never been so disappointed in you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey&#39;s defenses shattered. She protested through sobs, saying, &#34;Leland, I only wanted to bring our family honor! If the Wilde family acknowledged me,wouldn&#39;t that have helped you as well? I did it for all of us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland wasn&#39;t moved. &#34;For the family? You really think the Morgans wouldn&#39;t see through a fake serum? They&#39;d have seen through your lies in a heartbeat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey yelled, &#34;None of this would&#39;ve happened if not for Rylie! She&#39;s the one who called the serum fake - if she&#39;d kept quiet, no one would have known!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Stacey&#39;s face twist with tears, Leland felt,perhaps for the first time, just how much trouble his sister truly brought. If this had been Rylie, she would never have fought back or caused such a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was cold as he laid the blame. &#34;Excuses won&#39;t change anything. That serum-Nexo-7-was Rylie&#39;s achievement from the start, and you claimed all the credit while misleading everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey couldn&#39;t bring herself to face the truthin his words. Rather than admit her fault, she turned and fled, sobbing as she ran down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger warred with suspicion in Leland&#39;s chest. How could Rylie, supposedly ignorant and cast out from the Kirk family, rise so quickly - first as a star student, then as the creator of a valuable new medication, and now, in the company of the Morgans? Was she simply hiding her true talents all this time? Had they made a grave mistake expelling her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret gnawed at him, sharpo and persistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still puzzling over how to make amends with the Morgans when a colleague appeared in a rush,gasping for breath. &#34;There&#39;s been a turn for the worse with your brother. You need to come now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s face was drained of color, and he raced for the hospital ward.卵</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As night fell, Brad extended an invitation to Rylie for dinner at Savory Haven. In the midst of elegantly dressed patrons, Rylie&#39;s sweatshirt and jeans set her apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, her presence drew every eye. Despite her casual clothes, there was no mistaking her beauty or the unshakable composure with which she navigated the upscale room-utterly unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad guided her into the sanctuary of a private dining suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered by the expansive window, watching city lights flicker to life. &#34;With your condition, it&#39;s best not to go heavy on the food. Let&#39;s both stick to something simple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When their meal arrived, the waiter set a cake before Rylie, his manner both formal and warm. &#34;Our chef prepared this just for you. We hope it&#39;s to your liking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie studied the cake, noting that it was the very same kind Leland had given to Stacey that morning.Her surprise showed as she looked across the table at Brad. &#34;Is this really for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is,&#34; Brad replied, his features relaxing just a little.&#34;Every young woman deserves her own birthday celebration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That admission caught Rylie off guard; she hadn&#39;t expected Brad to notice something as personal as her birthday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gripped the utensils a little tighter, her eyes dropping to the table. &#34;The thing is, today isn&#39;t actually my birthday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One eyebrow lifted on Brad&#39;s face. &#34;Oh? Isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s smile turned wry, a touch bitter. &#34;Ever since Stacey came back to the Kirks, my birthday&#39;s disappeared from the calendar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their birthdays were separated by just two days,but for Rylie, the family had always made it clear that there would never be a celebration just for her.</p>
