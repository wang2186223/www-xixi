                <p>I stared, lost in his pale blue eyes. It felt as though it was sucking me in, and I lacked the ability to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isabel.&#34; His voice came, masculine, yet so serene and ethereal. How I had missed him.</p>

                <p>Shaking my head to get rid of the thoughts, I created a distance between us, and I could  see his brows knot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to see you again, Mr Klinn.&#34; I said, making it known that we had turned into nothing but strangers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had looked for you everywhere.&#34; He said, his eyes resting onto me, completely ignoring my earlier words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did not matter anymore, I thought as my eyes darted around, avoiding his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to break the spell.&#34; He said, and I turned to meet his serious gaze, my brows furrowing in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What spell?&#34; I asked, and he stared at me for a while before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you had left, I felt as though I had lost a part of me.&#34; He started, closing the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had looked for you, and when I did not find you, I felt my world become meaningless.&#34; He said, his gaze piercing my very soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you come back to me?&#34; He asked finally, his eyes shone hope, and my breath hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he asking me out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?&#34; I asked, feeling the anger that had begun to envelop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, yes...I&#39;m very serious.&#34; He said, and I could feel a vein pop in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he not acknowledging me as his mate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or was it that he was human?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the thought, I felt my heart soften. The moon goddess sure did not surprise me anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be my girlfriend.&#34; He said, and I snapped out of my reverie, my eyes moving to rest on the man whom I had rejected, my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still my mate, I thought. He had not accepted the rejection after all. I shrugged my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I said, my voice coming out as a whisper, and I could see his eyes stare expectantly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I will be your girlfriend.&#34; I said, and his lips curled up into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my breath stop as he pulled me to his embrace, hugging me tight. I leaned into his embrace, sniffing his musky masculine scent as I felt the butterflies in my tummy. Never had I thought I would get to see him again, let alone be in his embrace in a random shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; He said once he pulled out of the hug, and I walked behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had come across the attendant from earlier, and she smiled knowingly at me, my face growing hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Klinn as he walked out of the  shop, heading to the car that had been parked on the other side of the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He motioned for me to get in as he pulled the door to the passenger seat open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I have not informed him that I am leaving.&#34; I said, worrying that Alex might look for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Him?&#34; Klinn asked, his questioning gaze  landing onto me as I stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, yes. A friend whom had let me stay at his place for the meantime.&#34; I said, and I caught the glint that had flickered in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I see.&#34; He stated, a smug look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will have to look for you then.&#34; He added, and my eyes grew wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nudging me gently, I got into the car in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as he got in the driver&#39;s seat, starting the car and driving off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared out of the window, my eyes resting onto the beautiful sceneries of the city. The car had been enveloped by a deafening silence as neither I or Klinn had anything to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I soon turned, staring at his side view as he drove seriously. I felt mushy as I watched his long lashes flutter lazily, and my gaze travelled to his thin pink lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hungry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked, turning to look at me, and I could feel blood rush up to my face. I had been caught staring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away, I felt my cheeks burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you not hungry?&#34; He asked again, and I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of my rumbling stomach pierced through the silence that had lingered, and I felt as though the ground should swallow me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at Klinn from the corner of my eyes, and he had just continued driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We soon arrived at a restaurant, and Klinn led me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked until we had arrived at a separate room apart from the main restaurant. Klinn pushed the door open. and I walked behind him only to be greeted by the empty room that had been beautifully furnished with tables that were meant for customers, but not a single soul could be seen seated on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking towards a table, Klinn had pulled out a chair for me, and I sat, getting comfortable. I watched as he pulled out the chair opposite me, sitting gracefully onto it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How come there&#39;s just us here when there are so many tables?&#34; I asked, my curiosity getting the best of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not everyone is rich enough to afford this room.&#34; He replied, a smirk coming to rest on his face. Something I had never witnessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh...I see.&#34; I said, tearing my gaze away from him, my eyes coming to rest on the card that rested on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking it up, I had read through it.I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can order whatever you like.&#34; Klinn&#39;s voice came, and my eyes moved to rest on him for a second, before continuing to gaze onto the many dishes that had been listed on the menu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, I had ordered some sea food and beef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the food that had decorated the table, my mouth watered. I had not realized I was so hungry until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up my utensils, I began to eat, stuffing my mouth with food like my life depended on it. It had been merely few hours, but the situation had changed once more, and I was sitting in the most expensive room of a restaurant, having a meal with my mate in which I had previously rejected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While we were done eating, Klinn paid the bill, leading me out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had walked along the hallway again, heading to the open space in which more tables had rested, people sitting on them and having a meal. We had berely walked two steps into the main restaurant when a feminine voice pierced through I and Klinn&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, I was met with the questioning gaze of a lady who looked yo be in her twenties, her pale white skin complementing the red dress in which she had put on. She was human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to meet you here, Sir.&#34; She said, and my gaze turned to rest on Klinn who had a smug look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I remember who you are.&#34; Came his Curt words, and I could see the disappointed look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts wandered to whom she might be until my head hurt. In the end, Klinn had dismissed her, leading me to the car where we got in, driving off into the night.</p>
