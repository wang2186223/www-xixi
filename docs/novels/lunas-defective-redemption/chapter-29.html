                <p>The morning sun peeked through the cracks between the wooden window, casting a glow on my face as I laid in bed. The day had dawned, bringing it with new hopes and aspirations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lashes fluttered open, and my eyes rested lazily onto the ceiling above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had let my thoughts wander the previous night before finally drifting off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling off the bed, my shift at the cafe was in the evening, so I had nothing to do for the whole morning and afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making my way to the bathroom, I picked up the toothbrush that rested onto the vintage bedside table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brushed my teeth until it was sparkling white before pulling the stainless bucket that sat to a side of the bathroom, filling it up with cold water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes really tight, I poured the water over my head, bracing myself for the cold that was going to pierce through my naked skin after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shivered from the cold, my teeth chattering as I took a cold bath in the cold whether. I was not human after all, so I did not expect myself to get sick easily.  I had been bathing with cold water for a couple of days despite the city being in winter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Done with the bath, I pushed the empty bucket back to where it had been sitting, earning a screech from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making my way back to the room, I had hit my leg on the wooden door, earning a sharp pain from my leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch.&#34; I cried out, limping to the bedside, settling down on it. Today was such an unlucky day for me, I thought as I observed the toe in which I had hurt just now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping my leg to the side, I proceeded to wear the shirt in which I had been wearing on the first day I had been employed at the cafe. It was Klinn&#39;s, and despite the fact that I had already washed it, I could still perceive his scent from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made my heart tug. What would my life had been like if I was still pregnant? I asked myself, my hand pausing from wearing the shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life was easier as I wasn&#39;t pregnant, but it did not mean that I had not regretted murdering my own child. It was all because of Vivon, I thought, my chest hurting from anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my head to get rid of the many thoughts that had clouded my mind, I proceeded to wear the shirt that had came down below my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having nothing to do, I had decided to take a stroll in order to get my mind off my life&#39;s situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing the only tights I had below the oversized shirt, I clad my feet in my slippers, heading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been staring at the ice cream shop from afar, gawking at it since I had no money to afford it, until I bumped into something hard that sent me falling to the ground on my butt. I winced at the sharp pain on my waist, today was such a disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze traveled to the thing I had bumped into only to notice it was a man. His eyes stared at me, amusement sparkling in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait! I thought, as my eyes traveled down to his nose, then to his entire face, and finally to the clothes in which he had worn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You?!&#34; I yelled, pointing my index finger at the man who stood before me, his lips curling up into a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the man in pink, the man who&#39;s girlfriend had been creepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up abruptly, I had began to walk away hurriedly, but I caught his voice behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! You can&#39;t just walk away like that.&#34; He yelled, following after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halting, I turned around, my face red with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mister, if you could please do me a favor and stop following me.&#34; I said, stressing each word as calmly as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will.&#34; He said, and I had felt relieved for a moment until he said...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only if you tell me your name.&#34; His lips curling up once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isabelle.&#34; I said after much thought. It wasn&#39;t a big deal if he knew my name, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, I started to walk away from him, but he had followed behind me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heyy, You said you would not follow me anymore.&#34; I reminded him, as I halted only to watch him halt by my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only whistled, feigning innocence as he stared at me with a look that said &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You tricked me!&#34; I yelled, stomping on his foot and walking away, hoping that he would not follow me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard him hiss, probably from the pain I had inflicted on him, but he had followed behind me. I didn&#39;t know where I was headed, as I barely knew the area very well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And by this time I had not known where I was. Turning around, the guy in pink had been right behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we?&#34; I asked, my eyes scanning the place which was rowdy, people going about the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right, where are we?&#34; I heard him ask, stroking his chin feigning ignorance, and I glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, fine, I&#39;ll lead the way.&#34; he said, closing the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of my rumbling stomach pierced through my ears, and I hoped he had not heard it. I had not had breakfast as I had no money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had walked behind him, not knowing where he was taking me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful.&#34; I heard my wolf say, and I should have listened to it, but I had just brushed it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He halted, and I had bumped into his back really hard as I had been lost in thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch!&#34; I cried out as I rubbed my forehead. I was sure it was going to leave a bump, his body was sure hard for a guy who wears pink, I thought as I rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure have a fetish for bumping into me.&#34; He said, turning to look at me and I rolled my eyes as I rubbed my forehead one last time before putting my hand down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze traveled to my reddened forehead before speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here.&#34; he said as he turned around, staring at the building before him, and my eyes followed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I asked, my voice laced with confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had he brought me here?</p>
