                <p>Isabelle&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been days and I was already feeling better but whenever I felt the pain of losing my child, I felt like ending mine alongside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though it was a product of that cheater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cracking sound came from the door of the hospital room I still stayed in, and my head spun around to see who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Klinn and he walked gradually toward me, sitting down on the bed right beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Random thoughts ran through my eyes and I was lost staring right into his beautiful eyes, wanting to be his already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long are you going to be this miserable?&#34; I heard my wolf saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been this way for a long time now wanting for me to bend to her will but that was something that I could not grant her. Not especially when I was with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can see that you are getting better now.&#34; He noted, drawing closer to me and sitting down on the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. I am getting better now.&#34; I agreed, drawing up from the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The doctor said that you will be discharged today. So after you have taken some rest, how do you say you join me to a bar? There is a lot that we would want to Know about each other right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some moment, I could not get myself to spit out a single word from my mouth as I continued to stare at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Random thoughts ran through my head</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could it be that he has noticed it all this while he was just trying to end it so for me to recover?&#34; I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was gradually burning up with suspense right in the inside of me as my heart raced faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he was going to give me some hint if I gave him some heads-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already know about it?&#34; I Inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just take some rest now, we will be leaving soon.&#34; He finalized, getting up slowly from the bed and walking away from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile hovered on my lips as memories of the past flashed in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Come to think of it, why would he be so nice in the first place if not for the mate bond? I was grateful now that the moon goddess had given me another essence in life when I thought that all my hopes were already gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just the perfect mate!&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think that I should take over from this point, you don&#39;t want to blow up our good chances with him.&#34; I heard my wolf talking inside of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that she was angry that I was going to be getting the whole fan too bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can always talk to his wolf if you feel bored.&#34; I teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is if his wolf isn&#39;t more slow-witted than he already is. Just give me the chance to hasten things up. You are being such a bore right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry but I can&#39;t. And I am sure you know why.&#34; I stood my ground on the topic of discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot air snoozed through my nostrils as the door parted open and looking forward, I noticed that it was the nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can see that you are smiling today.&#34; She smiled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She helped me sign all the documents that I needed to sign and afterward, she helped me down from my bed and put the last finishing touches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So your boyfriend will be here anytime soon. He went to the pharmacy to get the drugs that were prescribed for you.&#34; She explained to me and I was about to nod my head when I heard his voice from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here already.&#34; I could pick out the expression that was hanging on his face even though I was not looking into his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just in time.&#34; The nurse smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over to me and when I didn&#39;t expect it, he took my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel the strange surge of electric current as he tightened his grip around my hands as though he wanted to feel more of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, he pulled his hands away, just when I was enjoying the touch of my second chance mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, ma&#39;am for taking good care of her.&#34; He appreciated the nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The pleasure was mine.&#34; She smiled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned around towards me and I could see the worried look written all over his face as though he was fighting with some strange emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as strange as it was, even though I was his mate, I could not feel even the slightest bit of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good at hiding his emotions from his mate isn&#39;t he?&#34; My wolf whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you listening... Hello..&#34; He waved his hands, snapping me off from my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked beside him until we got outside to the car park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This way.&#34; He pointed at a white luxury car at the far end of the car park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head spinned around in an eighty-degree motion to see if I was going to catch a glimpse of his driver or his assistant but it seemed as though he was the only one there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about you assistant?&#34; I could no longer help it but inquire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;David you mean. He is at the office since I have been really busy lately.&#34; He explained fitting the package in his hands into the car and opening the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had met his P.A about twice while in the hospital, and his driver always brought the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also noticed their curious stares each time they came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for the first time, I realized the pain that he had to go through wasting his time on me when it was all due to my reckless wish to end my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now someone else is suffering for it.&#34; I sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got into the car and I could not take my mind off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry for causing you so much discomfort.&#34; I apologized to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is no need for an apology.&#34; He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the rule of nature. You get as much as you give. There are a lot of things that you can do for yourself. In that light, I have done nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled his head closer to me and I closed my eyes, ready for a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a little bit surprised when he held my hands tightly and sighed. A sigh that was deeper in meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There it is.&#34; I heard him talking but I was getting a little bit confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the heck is he talking about?&#34; The thoughts rang in my head.</p>
