                <p>*Klinn&#39;s POV......</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sunlight pierced through the closed curtain of my room, casting a glow on my face from which I could see red under my closed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes soon fluttered open, squinting at the light that had hit my vision, and the pain from my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I massaged the space between my brows, intending to ease the pain, but it had not helped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting up on the bed, I had heard the chatter from downstairs, and I had guessed that the workers were back to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me realize I had been absent from the company for a couple of days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting out of bed, I made my way to the bathroom where I had took a cold shower to lessen the pain in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let the water pour over my head, feeling it run down my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally done with the bath, I headed back to the room, changing into a loose black long sleeves shirt and black jean pants. I had barely finished drying my hair when the knock on the door pierced my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34; I said, not bothering to look at the door, and I could see a maid come in from the corner of my eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir.&#34; She called out with a bow, and I nodded in acknowledgement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone has come to see you.&#34; She said, and I nodded, waving my hand for her to leave. Turning around, she left, her slippers glazing the marble floor. Closing the door behind her, I stared at the closed door wondering who it could be. David perhaps?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally done drying my hair, I clad my feet in some slippers and headed downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I alighted the stairs, I could see the head of a woman, and then her back length hair came into view as she had her back turned to me. I wondered who it might be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing my presence at the end of the stairs, she turned, her eyes meeting mine that had turned cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up abruptly, she had her head down as I took slow and steady steps towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir David asked that I bring the rest proposals to you.&#34; She said, and I could hear the nervousness in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hand them over and leave.&#34; I said, my voice having a hint of malice. She had been the one to come yesterday. The perfume in which she had worn invaded my nose, making my it tingle in irritation. Was David trying to test my patience?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, yes sir.&#34; She stuttered, turning around and rummaging through her bag, finally removing some papers in which she handed over to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may leave now.&#34; I said, collecting the papers, my eyes moving to rest on the exit and her eyes followed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding her head vigorously, she proceeded to pick up her bag from the couch, turning around to stare at me one more time before leaving, her high heels thumping the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her back as it faded, feeling devoid of any emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making my way to the dining room, I pulled out a chair in which I sat, the maids serving my breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ate, the clink and clank of the utensils reverberating throughout the entire room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gulping down the last bit of wine, the sound of footsteps pierced through my ears, making me turn my head to the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feeling better now, is it?&#34; I heard Grimm ask as he made his way towards me, his  lips curling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching me, he pulled out a chair in which he sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hadn&#39;t even told you to sit.&#34; I pointed out, my eyes not bothering to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since when did Grimm Antonio need anyone to tell him to sit.&#34; I heard Grimm ask, making me roll my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really are too cocky for a therapist.&#34; I said, my eyes moving to rest on Grimm who only shrugged, not saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; I asked, my brows furrowing in confusion. Sure, he was my therapist, but he had only visited my house once in a blue moon. It made me wonder what he had come for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stuff.&#34; He said as he proceeded to pour himself a drink, my eyes following his movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should a doctor be having alcohol in front of his patient?&#34; I asked, my eyes resting onto his glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not? Man gotta let out some hot air once in  a while, don&#39;t you think?&#34; Grimn asked as he twirled the glass of wine in his hand, sitting backwards onto the chair as his eyes rested onto me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some doctor you are.&#34; I commented, my words devoid of emotions, and he rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I had come here to check on you.&#34; He said, and I bet he could see the &#34;are you sure?&#34; Look in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled wearily as I had seen through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Okay, you got me.&#34; He said, a mischievous smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had come here to inform you about a seminar I had been invited to.&#34; He said, his tone getting serious, and I stared at him with a lazy look in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how exactly does it have anything to do with me?&#34; I asked, wiping the corners of my mouth using the napkin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has everything to do with you, Klinn.&#34; he said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was hoping if you would like to come?&#34; He added, his gaze expectant as he looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why should I?&#34; I asked, stroking my chin, seemingly in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some rare cases like yours would be talked about.&#34; He said, and my ears perked up at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing he had gotten my attention, he continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows, we might be able to combine the knowledge from it along with our previous ones, to find a cure for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know it&#39;s not as easy as you say, Grimm&#34; I said and he kept mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had always wanted to be normal, but what could I do when fate had already had it&#39;s say?</p>
