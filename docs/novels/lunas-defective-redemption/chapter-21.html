                <p>Waking up, I dragged my feet on the cold floor, intending to freshen up. It had been a day since Isabella had disappeared, and I had lived like an empty vessel, feeling my life hit rock bottom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not get how one person was able to influence my life this way. Had she bewitched me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had spent my time thinking about what Grimm had said, and maybe there was some truth to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing deeply, I had picked up my phone to call David, and he had answered on the third ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; I heard his voice say from the other end and I thought of what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cancel my schedule for today as well, I am not feeling so well.&#34; I said, and I could hear him go silent. The silence was deafening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking his silence for understanding, I hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must feel bad as well as I had not been active at work.</p>

                <p>The water raced down my body, each drop fighting for the finish line like racers on a racing track. My thoughts wandered, and seconds turned into minutes, and then into hours, but I had not been able to face reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where do I find her? I asked myself as I stayed in the shower for another hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what seemed like eternity, I turned the shower off, wearing a bathrobe and returning to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting dressed, I had worn a pair of black long sleeves shirt, and some joggers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way downstairs, my footsteps lazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking to the kitchen, I had prepared some instant noodles for myself. I wasn&#39;t one to eat something unhealthy, but right now I did not care at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally done, the aroma wafted in the air, invading my nose. It did not smell bad, in fact, it had smelt like the one my nanny used to cook for me years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made the memories come back, lucid before my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking off my thoughts from the ding that had pierced through my ears from the doorbell, I wondered who it could be.  I had given all the houseworkers a day off as I wanted to be alone. Perhaps Isabella had come back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at the thought, placing the noodles aside, hurriedly heading for the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on my face faded the very moment I had opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the woman who stood before me, wondering who she was. She was dressed in a formal yellow dress, and black heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing my piercing gaze on her, her eyes darted around, seemingly nervous, I could vividly hear her heartbeat. I had guessed she was human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is Fiona, and sir David asked that I give these to you.&#34; She said, stretching out her hand and handing some documents to me in which I accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He also said to make sure you go through them, and that it is urgent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I massaged the space between my brows, feeling helpless. Even my assistant had begun to take me for granted. Or had he forgotten I had told him I was on a day off?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around to go back inside, I caught the lady from the corner of my eyes as her footsteps followed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I halted, turning around to stare at her, my brows raising questioningly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the confusion in her eyes as she returned my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where might you be going?&#34; I asked, some irritation weaving into my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir David asked that I monitor you closely.&#34; She had began to say, but I cut her off...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That will not be needed.&#34; I said curtly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But sir...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is the real boss here?&#34; I asked, my voice laced with coldness, she might have been forgetting who the boss was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You, sir.&#34; She said, her head falling in despair as her eyes stared down at the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at her one more time, I turned around, closing the gate as I headed back inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the kitchen, the plate of noodles I had prepared earlier had turned cold. It only made my blood boil. How come I did not have a say in my own life anymore? I asked myself, my grip getting tight around the fork I was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dumping the plate of noodles into the trash can, I proceeded to order some breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day had gone by so fast, and I had been going through the documents in which David had sent until I had gotten tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Changing into a black pant, I headed out, wanting to clear my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had headed for a bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gulping down the whole bottle, I was ready to leave, but how could i without an extra bottle?Staggering towards the counter, I met a woman who had given me a seductive smile, her white teeth in display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more bottle please.&#34; My hoarse voice came out, and her smile grew wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handing me another bottle, I paid for it, heading out. I walked towards my car that had been parked on the other side of the road, my body swaying from side to side drunkenly. My throat burned from all the alcohol I had. And even with my hazy thoughts, I had not forgotten about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stopping when I had barely crossed the road, I crouched down, the pain from my heart rippling throughout my entire body. A tear rolled down my cheek involuntarily, and I wondered where all these emotions were coming from. Never in 8 years have I cried, until now. What had she done to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Isabelle Anderson, rejects you Klinn Ethan Adams as my mate&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her final words replaying in my head. Clutching my hair tightly, the pain cursing through my body. The anger I felt towards myself multiplied. Maybe it had been all my fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find mate.&#34; I heard someone say, and it jolted me back to my senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spun my head around, my eyes scanning the area, but it was dead silent except for the music from the bar from which I had come from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I asked, my ears perked up, waiting for someone to speak, but all I got was the deafening silence.</p>
