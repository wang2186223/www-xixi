                <p>He walked through the the woods, the twigs and dried leaves crunching beneath his feet. The once orange and pink sky had been painted grey from the downpour that was threatening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped, his eyes scanning the area. His ears perked up, and it was welcomed by the crickets that chirped. The sound of a wolf howling in the distance pierced through his ears, but he had not cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking deeper into the woods, he soon halted. He spun his head around, his eyes scanning the place seemingly lost, or looking for someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of twigs crunching pierced through his ears, making him whip his head to the direction in which it had come from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A figure could be seen making it&#39;s way towards the man, his black cloak rubbing the ground behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It took you long enough.&#34; The man said, his eyes following the figure as it came to stand before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have been late yourself.&#34; It said, it&#39;s deep masculine voice piercing through his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the meeting about?&#34; The figure asked, staring at the man from under the hood that was covering his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing much, just to increase the numbers.&#34; The man said, shrugging his shoulders as though increasing the numbers of rogued lycans was no big deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had known you to be weird, but I never thought you could be this much of a maniac.&#34; The cloaked man said, his voice laced with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you forgotten that you are a lycan yourself?&#34; He asked, and the other man rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You forget that I have no family, I have no pack either. So it is non of my business if the rogues multiply whatsoever. In fact, it is to my advantage.&#34; The man said, and by this time he had started to walk round the cloaked man, stressing his every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you forgotten that you had given your word to help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or have you forgotten that I own your life?&#34; The man said, halting to the cloaked Man&#39;s right side, the air around them dropping by a few degrees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, and you still have my word. But it has nothing to do with me if you get uncovered. There will come a time you will get eliminated by your own kind.&#34; The cloaked man said, his eyes flickering with unfathomable emotions beneath the hood of his black cloak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that is all, then I believe I should get to work.&#34; He added, walking into the heart of the forest, dragging his long cloak behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other man stared at the cloaked man&#39;s silhouette as it disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at nowhere in particular, many emotions flickering in his emerald green eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He morphed into his wolf, his growl reverberating throughout the woods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running through the woods, the air blew through his black fur, leaves brushing pass his fur like wet tongues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what seemed like minutes, he had arrived at a cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morphing back into his human, he walked into the cave, lighting up a fire torch as he made his way deeper into the cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flame from the torch illuminated, giving his eyes a glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking for not more than a minute, he soon reached a tomb. Dropping the torch, he took slow and steady steps towards it, his heard clenching beneath his chest. Reaching it, his eyes had caught the dust that had covered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using his hand, he dusted the dirt off, his expression crazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother.&#34; his hoarse voice came out as he caressed the rock that had been used to cover the tomb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at me, mother. I&#39;m doing okay now.&#34; He said, his voice beginning to crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you see how successful I am now?&#34; He asked no one at all as his lips curled up into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If only you you had hung on. I have seen father too.&#34; He continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t even know I exist.&#34; He said, bowing his head in despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But guess what, I am getting back at him.&#34; He said, his lips curling up again. And by this time he had began to chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed, and then minutes, but he had not stopped chuckling, it only grew insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping his hair tightly as if to rip it from his head, he staggered, his vision blurring from tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart hurt so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts wandered to that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running in the woods, the little boy spun his head around looking for her, but had not found her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain poured with vigour, and the stench of blood rose in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother!&#34; He yelled as he ran through the woods, frantically looking for his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued to run, puddles splashing beneath his feet.  The rain continued to pour, casting it&#39;s wrath on the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He halted, his gaze travelling to the figure that lay on the ground, her hair askew as the rain poured down on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took slow and steady steps towards her, feeling his whole world crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping to his knees before her, he shook her a couple of times, not getting any response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother.&#34; He called out, his voice beginning to crack as he stared at her face that had lost it&#39;s usual glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wet lashes soon fluttered open, taking in the face that stared down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jerome.&#34; She called out, her hand raising to touch his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I had done this. I had not known of the rogues, and I just wanted to speak to your father, the alpha.&#34; She choked out, tears falling from the corner of her eyes, merging with the rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should look for your father...tell him who you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leonard Moltenore.&#34; She said, her eyes starting to flutter close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please...mother.&#34; the boy stuttered, shaking his head frantically as he tapped her cheek with his palm, but she had already breathe her last breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother!&#34; he cried out, his pained voice merging with the thunder that struck in the sky as he held her body tightly to his chest.</p>
