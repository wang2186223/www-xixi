                <p>*Isabella&#39;s POV......</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would you like to have, Sir, Ma&#39;am?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked,  staring at the couple sitting across each other on a table, my heart warming at their interaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two cups of tea and some biscuits please.&#34; The man said, staring at the woman lovingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must be his wife, I thought as I smiled warmly at them, leaving to get their order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life hasn&#39;t been all that bad working for Mr Morgan, infact, I was doing fine except for the times I would have sleepless nights thinking about Klinn. It made my thoughts drift to how he was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making my way to the counter, I made two cups of tea, placing them on a tray along with some short bread cookies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making my way to where the couple sat, I placed the order on their table, holding the tray to my chest and offering a slight smile in which they returned. I had met different kinds of humans since I started working in the cafe, one who was willing to offer me poison due to her jealously. My smile turned sour as my thoughts went back to the man in pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my head, I turned around, leaving to stand behind the counter. Wiping the sweat that had rolled down my forehead, the heels of my sandals thumped the wooden floor as I walked, clutching the empty tray to my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you never going back to our mate?&#34; I heard my wolf say as soon as I settled down behind the counter. It took me by surprised, as it had not said a word for 24 hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t acknowledge me.&#34; I said, reminding it of the incident days ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it went silent. I guess it had ran out of words to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day had gone by so fast, and the customers were soon fading. Thing clink and clank of the keys reverberated throughout the empty street as I locked up the cafe, I was done with work for the day. I walked through the sidewalk, my feet thumping the grey concrete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hair had went loose, flying like waves as the wind blew through it. I looked up at the night sky, each star twinkling brighter than the other. And right in the middle stood the full moon which shone on the buildings of the city, creating an ethereal view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what seemed like eternity, I had reached the small worn out house in which I had been staying for days now. Mr Morgan had me rent it from the salary in which he was going to pay me, and hopefully I&#39;d be working in his cafe for a year, saving up a little to pay the rent by the end of the year. I sighed, my hand halting in the processe of unlocking the door as I thought of how much my life had changed in the past month. Never in my life had I thought that I would work for the humans, talk more be at their mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound from a distance away pierced through my ears, jolting me out of my reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whipping my head to the side, I had only caught the darkness that enveloped the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my thoughts off, I fiddled with the keys as I tried to unlock the door, I reeked of sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The low growl that pierced through my ears had made me halt again. Putting the keys into my pockets, I walked steadily towards the other side of the road, and towards the woods, clenching my hand into a fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever it was, I was ready to face it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked deeper into the woods, my eyes glowing bright gold as I crushed the twigs beneath my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stopping in my tracks, I had noticed the huge paw prints that had dented the soil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A werewolf... I narrowed my eyes at the revelation. Another werewolf had visited the human realm, but what for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing to my feet, my eyes spun around scanning the area. My ears perked up, but the only thing I got was the chirping sounds of the crickets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing deeply. I made my way back, my thoughts wandering to the paw prints I had seen earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally reaching, I unlocked the door, pushing it open and walking in as I closed the door behind me. leaning my back onto the closed door, I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath. I was sure something deadly was about to unfold, and I could not calm my nerves. Had Vivon known about the werewolf who had visited the human realm?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Probably not, I thought, making my way to the bed where I sat, staring into space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed, and then minutes, but I had not moved from the spot. Jolting from a mosquito that had buzzed pass my ear, My eyes followed it until it disappeared. I sighed in exhaustion, pulling off my shoes, and making my way to the little bathroom where I had freshened up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned to the room, my hair dripping with water as had no hair dryer to dry it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Changing into a pair of clothes in which Mr Morgan had lend me, I sunk onto the bed, laying face up and staring at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you there?&#34; I muttered quietly to my wolf, but it had not said a word. I guessed it had gone to sleep?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid staring at the ceiling for what seemed like hours until it spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; It asked, and I could tell the difference in it&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; I asked, my voice laced with hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You expect me to be okay?&#34; I heard it say, and I chuckled wearily which had only angered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kinda.&#34; I said, my voice coming out as a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Werewolf out in the woods.&#34; It said, and I sensed some emotions in it&#39;s voice. Emotions I could not fathom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes...I saw the prints.&#34; I said, feeling my heartbeat accelerate at what was to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then all went silent. Closing my eyes, I drifted off to the dreamworld.</p>
