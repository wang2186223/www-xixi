                <p>It&#39;s been a day since I had the deal with the human, and he might not have known, but his promise was sealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was a very boring day as I had nowhere to go. I sat on the bed, my eyes scanning through a book until I had gotten bored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly rising to my feet, I clad them in simple slippers, heading to my father&#39;s chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had walked for barely minutes until someone had bumped into me really hard, that had sent them falling to the floor on their butt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I my gaze met the omega, my eyes staring questioningly at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up abruptly, she held her head down, staring at the floor as she fiddled with the hem of her uniform,  not meeting my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Had you been blind?&#34; I asked, some irritation weaving it&#39;s way into my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scion, I&#39;m sorry. I had not seen you coming just now.&#34; Mildred said, and I snorted, walking away and leaving her as she continued bowing until I left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had reached, standing before the door to the alpha&#39;s chamber. Taking a deep breath, I stretched out my hand, making a fist and knocking on the door, the sound reverberating throughout the entire hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34; I heard from behind the door and I pushed it open, walking in as I flipped my hair backwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking in, I had met father sitting on his couch, a glass of red wine in his hand in which he twirled leisurely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brings you here, Vera?&#34; He asked, not sparing me a glance as he continued to stare at the painting of mom that was hung up on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only came to check up on you, father.&#34; I said, curtsying before him. He was my father, but it does not make him less of an alpha and I still had to give my respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waving his hand in the air, he motioned for me to rise, to which I obeyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking towards his wine cellar, I poured myself a drink, walking back gracefully towards the couch that sat opposite his and sinking myself into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t said a word, and I was forced to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have the army been handling the rogues that had invaded the borders of blood moon?&#34; I asked, my gaze resting onto my father whose face looked troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Recently, good.&#34; He started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, he had paused from sipping his drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But they seem to be multiplying quickly, it makes me wonder where they are coming from.&#34; He said finally, and I stroked my chin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has... Vivon not bothered to help you?&#34; I ask, some hesitation laced in my voice, I had known the answer to the question. Vivon had not helped, if not, all the troubles would have ended. Had he decided to cut ties with the blood moon pack now that we were not betrothed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made my heart clench, my eyes burning with hatred for the slut that had caused it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Came my father&#39;s reply, bringing me back from my reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My plan is to talk to him about it during the banquet. It was exactly why I had invited him in the first place.&#34; He continued, gulping down a mouthful of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since the Luna, my mother had passed away, the alpha had been miserable, drinking when he felt he couldn&#39;t take it. But then again, he still had the duties of an alpha to protect the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart ached for my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him as he had gulp after gulp, not bothering to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father.&#34; I called out, my gaze resting onto his face and he stared at me, his brow raised questioningly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like to go to battle with the army&#34; I said, my eyes shone firmness. I had also underwent training after all. I had went through combat training before I had came of age when I turned eighteen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; came his reply, and I stared at him, my eyes pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; he said again, and my determination wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It still haunts you.&#34; I stated, my gaze fixated on the flickering flames of the fireplace that sat to a side of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tearing my gaze away from it, my eyes rested onto my father&#39;s face as he stared at me, confusion edged on his face at my statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother.&#34; Came my short reply, and his face contoured more in drunken confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It still haunts you that mother had been murdered by a rogued lycan.&#34; I said, watching his face fall in sadness at realizing my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, his voice coming out hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never would have wanted it to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one would have wanted their one true love to get murdered.&#34; I said, sympathizing with him even if it had already been years. I had just came of age when It happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, his eyes fixated on his glass. He had tried his best to mask his hurt through an aloof expression, but deep down I could tell how hurt he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising to my feet, I had gulped down the entire drink in one go, placing the empty glass onto the table that sat in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will take my leave now, father.&#34; I said, and he nodded, taking another big sip from his glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking towards the door, I had paused, staring back at him before pulling the door open and walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My footsteps echoed in the narrow hallway as I walked back to my chamber, my thoughts wandering to the night before the Luna had lost her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are so beautiful, my dear.&#34; I heard mother say as her fingers brushed through my red hair, giving a tingling feeling to my scalp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am as beautiful as you, mother.&#34; My eighteen year old self uttered, turning around to stare at mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One day, you will grow up into a powerful Scion Lycan.&#34; She said, staring at me, unknown emotions swirling in her amber eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The day would come that you will have to protect I and the alpha.&#34; She added, pulling my head close to her to plant a kiss on my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back to the present, I had stood frozen to the spot, lost in my own reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother&#39;s words reverberated in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had not been able to protect her.</p>
