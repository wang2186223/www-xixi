                <p>Isabelle&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so nervous that I could not wait to feel his touch and for him to mark me as his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile. Everything revealed it. And now, I believed that this was the moment of truth when all my grief of the past would finally be rolled away forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I anticipated his questions, but he didn&#39;t seem to be ready just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s eat.&#34; He finalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts of the fact that he was going to be this slow-witted throughout our mate&#39;s years crossed my mind</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or what if he never got to say it? &#34;Too shy?&#34; I thought again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But right from the very first time that we met, he never possessed the attributes of someone shy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or he was just trying to hide it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that was the case, I was going to make things easier for him because my wolf was already growling deep down in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drew a really deep breath at what it was that I was about to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, I went down to my meal and I ate slowly, forcing all the forces within him to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So about the fact that you didn&#39;t try to outrun the truck that day. I have been meaning to ask you, was it because you didn&#39;t get the job that day.&#34; He inquired and I had to pause eating for a while. That was it? The question?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well this was my perfect chance to make him acknowledge it. Mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that was the reason, then I would be the most stupid to attempt to end my own life. There are a thousand and one opportunities for me to get a job in the city right?&#34; I flung the question back at him and I could see the acknowledgment in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are right to my relief. He ended up saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what was it that could push it to such an extreme?&#34; He inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s more like a pain in the heart. You know when someone you have this thing with decides to ignore you and pretend as though you never exist? That&#39;s what pushed me..&#34; I replied, staring right into his eyes to see the expression on his face but it was rather neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How slow-witted could he be?&#34; I thought again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay... That must have been terrible... So you had a boyfriend and he broke up with you?&#34; He Inquired and my eyes brightened even though that was not the response that I was expecting from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does he know that I had a mate before?&#34; I questioned myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every single minute that I spent talking with him, it only seemed to be getting me more into this strange puzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess so..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But then why did you kiss me back then.&#34; He said touching his lips as though he could still feel a bit down there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I am very confused. What did he mean by what he just said? Or was he just trying to play a joke?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know?&#34; I inquired further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are the one that kissed me so how am I supposed to know why? Do I look like him?&#34; He inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your ex.&#34; He replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated the fact that he was always bringing Vivion into our discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even though I had already promised myself that I was certainly going to move on from him, I could still feel the pain of the rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we stop talking about that?&#34; I said getting heated up and he nodded his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I discovered that there was little to know about him or just what he wanted me to know about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe there was another way around.&#34; I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think Isabelle, think,&#34; I growled, hitting my head intensely, then a sudden thought struck me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s time to get drunk,&#34; I said to myself with a dark smile hanging on my face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that smile on your face for?&#34; He Inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I get more wine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, sure.&#34; He replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his head slightly in the opposite direction, he beckoned to the waiter who was standing at the far end of the wall and ordered two glasses of wine for both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was not used to drinking but I was going to do it this time all for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a little bit sour and slightly acidic and I had to close my eyes, gulping it down my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laughter-like echoes fluttered into my ear and I opened my eyes swiftly and made a face at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this your first time taking something so strong? Or did you order it because of me?&#34; He smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be silly..&#34; The words were about to force themselves out of my mouth but I gulped them down quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though we were mates, it was still a fact that we barely knew each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I used to take such but it&#39;s been a long time. And now that I think of it, I want more.&#34; I heard myself saying, swinging my hands in the air as he helped them down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Slow down, will you? You are going to pass out.&#34; I Heard him saying</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t pass out. Just trust me.&#34; I replied but he refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after insisting, he gave up but was laughing after two more glasses and I was already floating in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;I guess that we have to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming over to me, he assisted me off from my seat while it felt as though I was floating in the air, spitting out rubbish from my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finally got outside and he was able to get me into the car successfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will take you home now. Just hold on for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to go home,&#34; I replied in a really slow motion that my speech felt like it lasted for minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t want to go home? Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The landlord said that the area is not safe anymore. There have been three cases of theft this week. And just before you came in, I almost became a victim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my, that is serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That means that you can&#39;t go back there in this State.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But where do you intend to stay now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you homeless?&#34; The Words flew out from my drunk lips before I could get them back.</p>
