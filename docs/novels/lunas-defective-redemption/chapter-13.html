                <p>Klinns&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the expression of bewilderment on her face and I pulled my hands away from her almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want it to seem as though I was some freak to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coughing slightly, I placed my hands on the car wheel and started the car engine while she searched for her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything wrong? Or something that you wanted to ask for?&#34; She inquired but I shook my head, trying to wade away her worries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about that. You will have as much time to talk today.&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have a deep sigh looking forward while trying to concentrate on driving. I heard strange sounds as though she was trying to say something to me but when I turned around towards her, her lips weren&#39;t even moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay? Were you trying to say something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. Didn&#39;t hear me? I thought you wanted to ask me about where I live or maybe you already know about that.&#34; Her hands swayed in the air while she fully mastered the speaking act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, I realized my mistake, I parked the car and turned around slowly towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My bad.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or you want to leave with me? To recover faster?&#34; I saw myself saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you saying Klinn?&#34; I growled inside of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some moments, it seemed as though I was out of control of my actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was this strange bond that never really allowed me to think straight whenever I was this close to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind flashed to my therapist. I had to see him as soon as possible so that he was going to provide me with an explanation of my experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t able to go as planned the other day, it turns out being absent from work for a day and missing a board meeting could possibly crash your company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow would be a perfect day for that.&#34; I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at her eyes, I noticed that she was embarrassed by the suggestion I just gave to her and she pulled her face that had turned pink away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess that would be a NO then.&#34; I said quickly while starting the car again and heading into the road just ahead of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So where do you live again?&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Down street.&#34; She replied. &#34;New Zealand estate number 22d.&#34; She replied to me and I sat on the trail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I continued to drive, the aura that emitted from her became much stronger as the minutes went by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And soon, I realized that I was already gasping for breath and I couldn&#39;t wait for us to get to her estate as soon as possible so that I would be free from this burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finally got to her estate and I drew a stop at her Suite but it didn&#39;t seem like any of us was ready to make the first move and get out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, we are here.&#34; I finally said when I could no longer bear the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Have to say thanks a lot, I would not be alive if not for you.&#34; She appreciated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to force through a smile but due to the burden, I barely knew how to do such. For the first time, I realized how much I had been lacking until she came along and opened up the mini gate to my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She certainly needs to have some great supernatural powers to be able to do that and that is certainly what I am going to find out about tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My one-way ticket to be free from the curse and I certainly cannot misuse it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to thank me yet. See you tonight.&#34; I took my hands off the steering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her feet swayed away from the floor of the car down to the contract floors as she waved at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, she vanished into the gate and it was all gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, I felt empty without a sense of direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight sigh escaped from my lips as I returned to the steering and I began to drive back home gradually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when I got to my mansion, I noticed something really strange there. There was a car obstructing me in the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who could that be?&#34; I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing off from the car where I sat, I shut the door closely behind me and I nosed over to the strange car that was on the premises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting closer to it, I recognized it well now. It was the car of my PA, David.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what could he be doing here? I never asked him to come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good day, sir.&#34; He greeted me getting out of the car and without saying a word, he took the door keys from me and opened the door for me to walk in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I finally got the Chance to inquire when we got in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot a stare at me, making my face twist into a sudden frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened up immediately and brought out a few documents in the bag that he had been clutching onto all this while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the resume for the meeting.&#34; He tried to explain to me but I was somehow confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Resume?&#34; The words escaped from my mouth with a confused expression on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t remember sir? Your meeting with the stakeholders that you have been getting ready for a  month now sir, is tonight!&#34; He announced and I gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to my meetings with Isabelle, I had forgotten everything about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit...What am I going to do now?&#34; I exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about Isabelle. We made plans tonight, I can&#39;t make her think or believe I am someone so irresponsible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something wrong sir?&#34; He inquired but right now, I was hardly listening to a word that he was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is only one way to do it now.&#34; I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared deeply at David with a strange look on my face that was enough to get him confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sick.&#34; I said to him but I was sure he did not understand what I was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand sir.&#34; He returned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sick and you are going there to represent me. That will do.&#34; I ventured but there was a worried look on his face. It wasn&#39;t going to be that easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But sir. There is a problem.&#34; He replied.</p>
