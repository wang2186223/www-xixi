                <p>&#34;If that is all, then I believe you all should get to work.&#34; I said, my voice reverberating throughout the room of board members. They had called for a meeting to address my absence at work for a few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had always been black sheep in the company. Those who despite working for the company, would want to kick me off the position of the CEO.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Ethan.&#34; I heard a man call out as the others dispersed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak.&#34; I ordered, glancing at him before focusing on the pen in my hand, playing with it leisurely as I sat, my back weighing onto the back rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must say, i believe you are a man of principles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, and I rolled my eyes. Another one trying to curry favor from the CEO, I thought. He was non other than Anthony Hayes, one of the board members who had always wanted me to see him as an ally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why is that?&#34; I asked, laziness evident in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, for one Mr Ethan, you do not let your personal life get in the way of your work in the company, so I believe there really might have been a serious issue.&#34; He said, his old eyes resting onto my face, and I smiled, one that did not reach my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Mr Hayes. For having so much faith in me. You are really such a considerate man&#34; I said, but I bet he could tell the evident sarcasm in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly standing to my feet, I had walked away from him, David following behind me as I made my way to my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you so slow?&#34; I asked, sinking myself onto the chair as my eyes rested onto David who had been panting like he had ran a marathon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir...&#34; He called out, putting his palm to his chest as he continued to pant, out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had been walking pretty fast, I am not as healthy as you.&#34; He said, and by now he had begun to catch his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about the applications sir?&#34; David finally asked, his gaze rested onto me as I twirled my phone in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is wrong with them?&#34; I asked, my gaze directed at David who scratched his neck awkwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Err..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak.&#34; I said calmly as I continued to stare at him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir...I had told you about my mother&#39;s health a week ago, and I was hoping you could grant me a week&#39;s leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm.&#34; I hummed in approval</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had said you were going to take a look at them the day before...&#34; He said, not meeting my gaze, and I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring them to me right now.&#34; I said, and his eyes grew wide for a moment before returning to normal</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Sir. I&#39;ll have the substitute assistant bring them over to you. Thank you, Sir&#34; He nodded, turning around and walking out of the room, closing the glass door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had only been a few minute when a knock came at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34; I said, not bothering to glance at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of heels thumping the tiled floor pierced through my ears, and I finally raised my head only to find the lady from the day before walking towards me as she held some papers to her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir.&#34; She called out, and my gaze landed onto her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are the applications.&#34; She said, handing the papers to me which I collected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may leave now.&#34; I said, starting to scan through the papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir?&#34; She asked, and I stared up to see the questions swirling in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can ask David to send me another substitute.&#34; I said, and she turned quiet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But sir, I&#39;m the only one available.&#34; I heard her say, and I stared at her, my brows furrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get someone to switch positions with you then.&#34; I said, my gaze moving onto the papers, and by this time David had walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong, Sir?&#34; He asked when he sensed the air in the room had dropped by a few degrees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send me another substitute.&#34; I said, glancing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she&#39;s the only one available sir.&#34; David said, his brows knotting in confusion by my decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have someone switch positions if possible.&#34; I said, twirling the pen in which I was holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone else has been assigned to the new project sir, there are no other possible candidates.&#34; David said, his voice pleading, and I stared at the lady where she stood across me, her fingers digging into her palms. I could perceive the faint scent of blood, merged with her choking perfume.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine then.&#34; I said, deciding to put up with her for a week. I could see the relief on David&#39;s face at my decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may leave now.&#34; I said, and he nodded, picking up a few boxes from the inner room of the office, walking out and leaving me and the substitute assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is...&#34; She tried to say, but I had shushed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not care what your name is, and you should probably get to work now.&#34; I said, my cold tone reverberating throughout the room as I continued to stare at the papers I had been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could sense her walking to the table that was meant for David, and I could feel my blood boil. Had David not been able to find someone better?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five hours had passed, and I could sense she was exhausted, but I had not cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, I heard the screeching sound of her chair filled the room, piercing through my ears, but I had not glanced at her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like some coffee, Sir?&#34; I heard her ask, and I could feel her gaze on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Came my curt words, not looking up from my pile work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her linger for a bit until her footsteps echoed in the room, eventually fading behind the closed door.</p>
