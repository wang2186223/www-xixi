                <p>*Vera&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat there frozen to the spot, unknown emotions enveloping me. My eyes stared at nowhere in particular as I tried to take in the news I had just received.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pregnant?&#34; I muttered under my breath, my heart clenching beneath my chest. He had touched her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a pang in my heart at Vivon touching another woman. I did not care if it were mistresses, but his mate? I felt threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had he rejected her if he knew she was pregnant, Unless...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my face grow hot, my lips curling up like I had finally realized something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Vivon not love her anymore?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My smile got wider as I stared into space, my thoughts wandering possibilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to do something, I thought stroking my chin, seemingly in deep thought. I had to make sure she never comes back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up from the bed abruptly, I had worn a pair of silver heels. Stuffing my phone into a hand bag, I dabbed my lips with red lipstick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally I was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling the trolley in which I had ate from, I ordered for a maid to clear it up, heading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as the guards bow their heads slightly at my presence, and I felt my pride grow. I was the perfect specimen for a Luna. How could Vivon not see that, I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading to my car, I pulled the door open, entering and driving out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I actually had not known where I was headed in the human realm, but by this time I had driven on a deserted highway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the steering wheel, I thought of what to do. How do I make her stay in the human realm forever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what should I do with the child? I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner a later, she might go back to Avid mars claiming that she had borne an heir for Vivon, And what if he accepts her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clutched the wheel tightly, my head staring to hurt from my clouds of thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knock on my car window brought me back to reality, and I turned to look at the person whom had been knocking from behind the tinted glass of my car window. My head spun around to see where he might had come from, but there was not a possibility. He had no car,  and neither did he have a motorcycle. Where had he come from?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling the glass down, I stared at the stranger, and I bet he could see the irritation on my face at being disturbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brow raised questioningly as if asking &#34;Do I know you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he smiled embarrassingly, scratching the skin behind his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, I was stranded, and I was wondering if you could help me?&#34; He said, continuing to  smile awkwardly, and I stared at him, my face devoid of any emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat to ease the awkwardness, he seemed to be waiting for my reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, a my lips curling up into a smirk, and I watched his eyes widen in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you perhaps have something to offer me?&#34; I asked, making use of the opportunity as it presented itself to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at him from head to toe, he did not look poor. He was clad in a pink designer jacket, and beneath it was a black t-shirt. Going down, he had worn a pink ripped jean, and had clad his feet in black sneakers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which male wears pink? I thought, and I could detect the disgust in my own own voice as I stared at him...I had said it out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have money, I could give you any amount, just get me out of here.&#34; I heard him say, and I smiled amusingly. How could he speak to a Scion commandingly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again, I expect no less from a lowly male human who had clad himself in pink. I clicked my tongue at the thoughts that went through my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it look like I&#39;m in need of money?&#34; I asked, smirking once again, and he shivered. The jacket he wore could probably not shield him from the cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; He said, frustration weaving into his voice that had turned hoarse. Probably from being here for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three favors.&#34; I said, my gaze getting serious and he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything.&#34; He said, and by this time he had spun his head around abruptly, seemingly in sudden alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise me.&#34; I said, and he nodded again, his gaze turning back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise. Just please tell me.&#34; He said pleadingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll tell you when I need the favors.&#34; I said, motioning for him to get into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking to the other side of the car, he pulled the door open, getting in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started the car, driving off and I could hear him heave a sigh. Probably one of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence in car was deafening and only our breaths could be heard as neither of us wanted to say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had driven for about an hour, and I had finally began to see little houses come into view. It made me wonder how exactly how the human had got stranded. Shaking it off, I continued to drive, and by this time I had asked his address, my head turning to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just drop me off at the upper east side, fifth avenue&#34; He said, confirming my suspicions of him being rich.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not saying a word, I continued to drive, the ride continuing in silence as he stared out of the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what seemed like hours, I drove into a street, fancily dressed people striding purposely down the side walks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stopping in front of one of the buildings as per his command, he turned to me, smiling gratefully and I reminded him of the deal, to which he nodded vigorously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he pulled the door open, climbing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bending to stare at me from the whined down glass, he said...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is Alex.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him with a deadpanned expression before finally replying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vera.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, walking into the building and shutting the door. I sat in the car, staring ahead of me. I had started to put my plan into action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled deviously, my eyes holding a malicious glint.</p>
