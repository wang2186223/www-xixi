                <p>I had finally finished my bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, he had taken me to his house! Well, I guess he didn&#39;t know what to do or where to take me after I had passed out from the slap that woman gave me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just who was she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had some good strength for a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting out of the tub, I wrapped myself up in a bathrobe, retiring to the room where I  had found the closet that had been stacked with female clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Must be his girlfriend&#39;s.&#34; I muttered to myself as my eyes feasted themselves on the many clothes that had rested in the closet. Picking up a blue floral dress, I had worn it. Tying my hair up into a messy bun, I pulled the door open, heading out to find Alex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My footsteps echoed in the empty hallway as I walked through it. Getting to it&#39;s end, I was greeted by the cozily furnished living room, a black, furry Italian rug resting in the middle of the black couches that sat close to the fireplace. Walking to the couch, I placed her had on it, feeling the soft material under my touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Admiring the couch now, are we?&#34; I heard Alex&#39;s voice say from behind me. Turning around, my gaze fell onto him as he stood, his usual smirk plastered across his face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe.&#34; I said, rolling my eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of my rumbling stomach soon pierced through the room, and my face burned with embarrassment as I stole a glance at Alex from under my long lashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come.&#34; He said, his expression remaining serious, and I followed behind him as he made his way to the little dining area that rested to a side of the room. Getting closer to the glass table, the sweet aroma of food wafted in the air, hitting my nostrils, making my stomach rumble in excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up.&#34; I said in a shushed tone as if to reprimanded someone, but in fact, I had been talking to my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking towards the glass table that could fit at least ten people, I pulled out a chair opposite Alex, settling onto it as my eyes rested onto the many dishes that sat on the table. My mouth watered at the sight, and I could feel the drool threatening to escape the corner of my lips. Had he cooked all these? I asked herself, my eyes moving, finally settling on Alex who sat, seemingly reading a newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The man in pink also reads the news like other men?&#34; I muttered under my breath, and no matter how low my voice had been, Alex had caught it. Staring up, he glared at me, making me smile sheepishly, and he went back to reading the newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat.&#34; Came his voice, not looking up, and I picked up my utensils, filling up my plate with seafood from one of the many dishes. Beginning to eat, only the sound of my utensils could be heard. Occasionally stealing glances at Alex, I had noticed how he had not taken a bite from the food, and my gaze traveled to the almost empty table. When had I eaten so much? I thought, my mouth dropping in awe at my appetite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stuffing my mouth with the last bit of shrimp, I chewed carefully, my eyes moving to rest on Alex again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something on my face that you keep staring at?&#34; Came Alex&#39;s question, and by now he had stared up to look directly at me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; I replied, my brows furrowing in confusion as I stared at him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps you find me handsome?&#34; He asked again, a smirk coming to form on his thin lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In your dreams.&#34; I said, rolling my eyes. He was merely half as handsome as Klinn, I thought in my mind as my gaze landed on Alex, staring at him absentmindedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you disappeared from earth?&#34; Alex&#39;s voice cut through my thoughts as I blinked a couple of times, clutching the glass of water in which I had picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was the woman from last night?&#34;  Alex asked, his gaze resting onto me, and by this time, I had paused from the glass of water in which I was about to take a sip from. My gaze traveled, landing onto him, and I spoke...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...don&#39;t know.&#34; I said, my gaze lowering. I had not known who the woman was, and I had not seen her face either. It made my shudder at the thought of someone wanting to hurt me. My mind traveled to the side of my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hissed at the pain when I had touched it, earning an amused smile from Alex who had been watching me all the while</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are one weird person.&#34; I heard him say, and I glared at him, dropping my hand to the side as I said...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not weirder than your creepy girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze narrowed at me, but he had not said a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you don&#39;t know the woman.&#34; He said, his gaze getting serious as he stared at me, and I  nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm.&#34; I hummed, taking a sip from the glass of water in which I had been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will not be safe for you to go back there as she had probably known everything about you including where you live.&#34; Alex said, his gaze hardening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you stay here for now?&#34; Alex added,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;uhmm I don&#39;t think I should&#34; earning a long, hard stare from me as sat opposite him on the table, my eyes flickering with emotions he could not fathom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Came my lowered voice as I stared down at the glass table. I had never thought my stay in the human realm would be so complicated. All I had wanted when I had first came here was a life not like the one in Avid mars where I was tortured everyday by my own mate. I had thought that living a life as a human would be more simpler, who knew that the humans&#39; lives were also full of wickedness just as the wickedness of lycans. I had thought that I would live with no eyes on me, but who knew that I would now be running from someone whom was after me. Someone whom I had no idea if she was human, or probably a lycan whom had held a grudge on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing deeply, I shook my head to get rid of the thoughts that had clouded my mind.</p>
