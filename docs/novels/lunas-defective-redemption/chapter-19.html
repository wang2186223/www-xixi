                <p>Isabelle&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first rays of the morning peeked through the window, casting a soft glow on me as i laid on the small mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tossed and turned, intending to escape the wrath of the morning sun, but I had failed miserably. Feeling frustrated, my lashes slowly fluttered open, staring up at the ceiling, it had not looked like the ones in Avid mars. The sheets brushing against my skin also did not feel familiar. Yesterday, I had gotten Mr Morgan&#39;s help, he had offered me a job, and a small room to sleep in, which I was thankful for as I had nowhere to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My rent was due in a weeks time. My heart tugged painfully at the memory from yesterday where I had rejected him. Sighing deeply, I rolled off the bed, my dainty feet resting onto the worn out wooden floor, making it creak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making the bed, I headed for the small bathroom where I freshened up, changing from Kinn&#39;s clothes in which I had been wearing yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And finally tying my hair up into a messy bun, I headed to the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood behind the counter, my eyes looking lifeless from fatigue. With my head resting on my arm, my eyes lay closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly sank into unconsciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel my hair clung to my skin and I take a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel soo exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear footsteps that thumped the wooden floor and reverberated throughout the empty cafe, piercing into my ears and snapping me out of my short but beautiful siesta. A man had walked in. He was clad in a casual long sleeve pink shirt and black pants, something a normal guy would not wear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Strange&#34;, I thought</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking steadily towards a table, he pulled out   a  chair in which he sat gracefully. He was actually the first customer for the afternoon as many people had gone to work after buying their morning coffee...the cafe was mostly filled in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging my feet unwillingly on the wooden floor, I made my way towards where he sat, going through the menu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards the man that had entered the cafe, my heart thumping in anger. I had not gotten a wink of sleep last night as I just couldn&#39;t get my thoughts off what was to come. It wasn&#39;t the stranger&#39;s fault, but he still had to cut my nap short, which was his offense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would you like, Sir?&#34; I asked the human, a fake smile creeping its way up my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he stared at me, his grey eyes meeting mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Starbucks&#39; Caramel Macchiato.&#34; His deep masculine voice pierced through my ears, and I was sure it could make any girl fall in love, but I was an exception as it only made me more sleepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A cup.&#34; He added, winking seductively at me, and my face contoured in disgust at his crude behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything else?&#34; I asked, continuing to fake my smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That would be all.&#34; He said, waving his hand, motioning for me to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How cocky, I thought, snickering as I dragged myself lazily towards the counter where I had brewed the coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lowly human.&#34; I heard my wolf say, and I could spot the disgust in its voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally done, I made my way to his table, placing it in front of him, all the while, his eyes watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, I had been about to leave, but was halted by his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please sit with me.&#34; He said, and I turned to look at him, my brows raising into a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me?&#34; I asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit with me.&#34; He repeated and I rolled my eyes. What exactly did he think of the cafe? Or me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not what you think, miss...I just need someone to talk to.&#34; He said, and I nodded. Mr Morgan did say to treat the customers right, so I guess he wouldn&#39;t mind me giving someone a therapy session, I thought, as I chuckled in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out a chair, I sat opposite the weird guy in pink, and by this time he had taken a sip from his cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see, my girlfriend broke up with me, and I was wondering if you could help me.&#34; He said, his eyes resting onto me, and I stared wearily at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of help are you asking for exactly?&#34; I asked, my eyes staring suspiciously at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard him chuckle as he stared at me amusingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was wondering if you could...mend my heart?&#34; he said, his gaze getting mischievous, and an alarm went off in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly did he want?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liar.&#34; My wolf warned, and I bit my lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alex.&#34; I heard a third voice call out behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whipping my head to the direction in which the feminine voice came, I was met with a black haired lady who had been dressed in a fitted red off shoulder gown that accentuated her curves. Her hair had been tied into a bun, showing off her long neck of white skin, where a little pendant had been hung, resting onto her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up abruptly, I watched as she walked towards the table, her piercing gaze sweeping over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must be his wife, or probably his girlfriend, I thought as I stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze shifted to the man who sat leisurely, sipping from his cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what might you be doing here?&#34; She asked, and he just stared lazily at her without answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me.&#34; I said, intending to leave but was halted again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet...is this how you serve your customers?&#34; I heard her ask, and I turned back to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, ma&#39;am... what would you like to have?&#34; I asked, faking my smile again. This felt tiring already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Poison.&#34; She said, her gaze resting onto my face, and I felt the urge to gauge her eyes off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have that on the menu, ma&#39;am.&#34;  I said, trying to sound polite, but the fake smile faltered when she said...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, the poison isn&#39;t for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is for someone who is trying to steal from me.&#34; She said, smiling at me, but I could see the hostility in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My guess?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was an overprotective girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They actually did fit each other as I stared at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A liar, and a sadist.</p>
