                <p>Klinn&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had placed the new phone by her bedside, hoping that she would see it as soon as she woke up, and now as I sat in my office, my thoughts wandered about, finally getting cut by the sound of the door that had slid open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, someone has come to look for you. She said her name was Kate.&#34; David&#39;s voice came as soon as he walked into the office, and my brows knotted at the name in which he had mentioned. Kate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her in.&#34; My voice came, and David nodded, turning around and leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a minute had passed, he pushed the door open again, walking in with a woman following behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bowing his head, he left, and my eyes moved to rest on the woman who was dressed in a casual coffee brown dress, her black hair styled with some strands falling onto the side of her face. I recognized her at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Been long, huh?&#34; She asked when she came face to face with me, a bright smile marrying her face, and I went ahead to offer her a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out the chair she settled onto it gracefully, placing her bag on the table in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hadn&#39;t asked you to sit.&#34; I pointed out, the smile not leaving my face and she rolled her eyes. She had not changed a bit. I had known Katherine for about five to six years now, and only she knew about my condition apart from Grimm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your smile looks real.&#34; She stated, her eyes sweeping lazily over my face, and my smile lowered until it faded completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Last time I had seen you, you had tried so hard to perfect a simple smile. What exactly had I missed?&#34; She asked, and I smirked as I responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I figured.&#34; She said, and I nodded knowingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you perhaps found a woman now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have.&#34; I stated, and she stared at me, as if not believing my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not being serious, are you?&#34; She asked, and I shrugged my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my. You wouldn&#39;t have invited me to your wedding if I had not come back huh?&#34; She asked, and I kept mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch!&#34; She exclaimed, placing her hand on her chest to exercise hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How had Seattle been?&#34; I asked, my gaze getting serious, and the playfulness on her face fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not exactly great, but it was not bad either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t bad at least.&#34; I stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh huh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Anne walked in with some papers in her hands. She was the substitute assistant whom had filled in for David while he had been away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, David asked that I hand these to you.&#34; She said, walking towards the table where I accepted the papers from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, she walked away, fading away behind the closed door, and I turned to see Katherine staring in the direction in which she had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it just me, or does she like you?&#34; Katherine said as she turned to me, her eyes shone mischievousness as a smirk came to rest on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had not said a word. I did not care if she liked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the sound of my ringing phone pierced through our ears, and I took out my phone to see it was Isabel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; I called out, putting the phone to my ear, and her voice came from the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got your note.&#34; She said, and I smiled unconsciously. I had felt guilty for not getting her a phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good then. And how do you like my attempts at being a good boyfriend?&#34; I asked, my gaze moving to rest on Katherine whose eyes had went wide in realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had mouthed for us to have lunch together after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll pick you up for lunch later.&#34; I said, and Isabel hummed in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call got disconnected, Katherine burst out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A good boyfriend, really?!&#34; She squealed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had not known that you could be this...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to say but shut her mouth at the glare I had directed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, fine...I will let you off this time.&#34; she said, shaking her head helplessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We talked for a while, and Katherine soon stepped out to get us a cup of coffee while I looked at the documents in which Anne had brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She soon walked in, carrying a cup of coffee, and my eyes moved from the papers to stare at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a seat on the sofa that rested to a side of the room, she stared at the cup before bringing it to her lips, taking a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you staring at me like that?&#34; She asked once she noticed my confused stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s mine?&#34; I asked, referring to the cup in her hand, and she stared blankly at me before saying...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There was only a cup of latte left&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You prefer the cappuccino.&#34; She pointed out, and I turned, focusing on the work in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat in the office for hours, me burying myself in a pile of work, and Katherine doing something on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour more, I was done. Picking up my phone from where it sat on the table, I informed Katherine that we would be leaving to have lunch, and she beamed at the thought if meeting Isabel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked to the company garage where the car had been parked, waiting for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting in, the chauffeur drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked Isabel up, and the trio of us headed for a restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir.&#34; The receptionist called out with a bow as we walked into the restaurant, and I nodded in acknowledgement. Walking to a nearby table, I pulled out a chair in which Isabel sat in, and I could see the question swirling in her eyes as she stared at Katherine who looked happy to see her. I had forgotten to introduce them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katherine, this is Isabel... my girlfriend.&#34; I said, and Katherine smiled, stretching out her hand for a handshake at Isabel who took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to finally meet you, Isabel. I am Klinn&#39;s long lost friend&#34; She said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you manage to make this ice melt?&#34; Katherine asked, her question directed at Isabel as she referred to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze turned to Isabel, and I caught the little blush that had painted her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, now...let&#39;s all not talk about unimportant stuff.&#34; I said, dismissing Katherine&#39;s question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the waiter had served the food, and we all ate, Katherine doing most of the talking as I and Isabel listened, Isabel giggling most of the time. Both ladies seemed to be getting along just fine, and it put my mind to ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nice to have you back, Katherine.&#34; I said, and she smiled.</p>
