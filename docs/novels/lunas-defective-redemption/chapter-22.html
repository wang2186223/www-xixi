                <p>*Vivon&#39;s POV*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat on the furry white couch beside the fireplace that brightened up the dimly lit room, my eyes shone the reflection of the flickering flames as I twirled the glass of white wine in my hand. I had always been drinking, and it was all because of her...Isabelle. I might have been looking at the fire, but my thoughts were elsewhere. I had to admit there were some days I felt like I couldn&#39;t wait any longer for her to come back, and on those days I would have a drink with Richie, getting drunk to stupor. And other times we would go for a run in the woods. But despite how much distractions I try to bring to myself, my mind still wanders. My heart clenched beneath my chest when I thought of how she was carrying our child, but I brushed off the feeling. I sat there for what seemed like hours, the wood in the fireplace burning out, the room getting darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head whipped towards the curtains, and I gulped down the last bit of wine, my emotions getting grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come out.&#34; I said, my eyes not leaving the curtain, and just then, a black furred wolf emerged from behind it. It&#39;s amber eyes stared at me, unfathomable emotions flickering in it and I stared back at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have you come here for?&#34; I asked, rolling my eyes as I poured myself more wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a sip, my gaze once again turned to it, and I could see the white envelope between it&#39;s muzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting down my glass on a table that sat not far away from me, I walked towards the wolf, pulling out the letter from between it&#39;s muzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding it&#39;s head, it leapt out of the window, it&#39;s silhouette disappearing into the woods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ripping the envelope, I opened the peace of paper, my eyes moving as I read it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like the Alpha had not given up on me.&#34; I said, a smirk forming on my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I had canceled my engagement with his daughter, he seemed not to be on good terms with me, but I guess he had understood how pointless it was. He still needed my help, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Folding the paper, I walked steadily towards the fireplace, throwing it in as I watched it burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next week, is it?&#34; I asked to no one in particular as I stroked my chin, seemingly in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked to my room, intending to freshen up, which I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Done taking a bath, I sunk onto my bed, my eyes wide open, staring at the white ceiling. It felt like I was being haunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning came, and I tossed and turned on the bed, feeling the pain in my head multiply. I had managed to get some sleep after hours of being awake last night. Massaging the space between my brows, I tried to ease the pain. Feeling frustrated, I got out of the bed, heading to the shower where I freshened up. Getting dressed, I went down for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the dining table which could fit 20 people, I pulled out a chair, settling onto it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, my meal had been served by the maids. I had been alone on the table since I had no family and no mate. I should feel sad about it, but the truth is that I didn&#39;t mind it. I did not mind being alone at all except for the fact that I miss her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up my utensils, I cut into the beef that sat on the plate in front of me, putting it into my mouth. I chewed and swallowed, the clink and clank of the utensils reverberating throughout the room as I ate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enjoying your meal without me now, are we, Vivon?&#34; I heard the familiar voice say, and I had not bothered to look at who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richie walked towards me gracefully, his clad feet thumping the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the table, he pulled out a chair in which he sat, his eyes finally resting onto me, and my eyes moved to look at him. He might have been expecting that I had went insane for having my mate leave, as I could see the amusement in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pouring a drink for himself, he took a sip, his eyes resting onto me again, seemingly having something to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can say anything.&#34; I said, not bothering to glance at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me, his emotion grave, and I knew it had something to do with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard him take a deep breath before clearing his throat and speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The rogues seem to be multiplying by the day.&#34; He said, his eyes scanning me to gauge my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How exactly does it concern us, Richie?&#34; I asked, chuckling wearily as my eyes met his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you think that it has nothing to do with Avid mars, but sooner or later, you know it is going to get to us.&#34; I heard Richie say again, his gaze getting serious as he stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you come here to strip me off my post to??&#34; I asked, and by this time I had began to get furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have they sent you to me?&#34; I asked again, my voice laced with glaciers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Vivon. That is not why I have come here.&#34; he said, and I fought hard to believe his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why? You think I am not fit enough to protect the pack because I do not share the same views as all of you?&#34; I asked, shaking my head as I smiled amusingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what you think is best for the pack.&#34;  I heard him say finally, and there was silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of us had spoken, and I had continued to eat, not saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is your wait for Isabella?&#34; I heard him ask and I turned to look at him. He had a smirk on his face. I bet he was enjoying my situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling my eyes, I kept mute, and he smiled knowingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a little more time, Vivon. She will come back.&#34; He said, and somehow it made me feel hopeful</p>
