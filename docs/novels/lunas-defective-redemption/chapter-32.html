                <p>After the breakfast, I and Alex had walked aimlessly, discussing, but it was mostly Alex pushing my buttons and watching me flare up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was finally time for my shift, I headed back to the cafe, thanking Alex for the meal once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I pushed open the glass door of the cafe, my eyes scanning the place, it was empty. There was not a single customer, and I sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making my way to the back of the counter, I was met with the lady in which I had seen the very first time I had came to the cafe. I had found the lady&#39;s name to be Maggie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making my way towards the apron which was hung to the wall, I  ignored Maggie, playing as if she was invisible as we did not get along so well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up the apron in which I tied around my waist, I heard Maggie&#39;s voice behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good luck on your shift, Isabel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, I was met with Maggie&#39;s mischievous gaze. I could tell maggie&#39;s words were contradicting the look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was she trying to fool? I thought as I rolled my eyes, intending to walk pass Maggie as I had something to get from the store room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you now learnt to walk out on me?&#34; I heard Maggie ask as the latter gripped my arm, preventing me from leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of my arm, Maggie.&#34; I said, my voice coming out as a warning, but Maggie had rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do what I want to do, and right now I do not want to let your arm go.&#34; Maggie said, her hand clutching harder onto my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t we make her our meal for tonight?&#34; I heard my wolf taunt in the back of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew my wolf had missed preying on the humans, but there was nothing I could do, this was not our territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you forgotten that the humans also have a dungeon? it&#39;s called a prison&#34; I mind linked my wolf, and I could imagine it rolling it&#39;s eyes as it said...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It cannot be worse than the one back in Avid mars, the humans are weaklings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still, this is their territory, not ours. So you cannot do anything you want.&#34; I replied</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; It finally said after seconds of silence, and I heaved a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Heyy! Are you deaf?!&#34; I heard Maggie yell, bringing me back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at Maggie whom was still holding onto my arm really tight, and I wiggled it out of the her grasp, walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maggie watched as I left, her mind swirling with anger. I could feel the hostility in her actions. Perhaps she thought i was a weekling. Little did she know that there was more to Isabelle Anderson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stomping her foot, I watched from a corner as she grabbed her bag which was laying close to her grasp, walking out of the cafe, her face red with fury. Ever since I had been hired, I had been Mr Morgan&#39;s favorite employee, making her invisible no matter what she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had only been a couple of days, but she already despises the me to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was that I had not really wanted to get anything from the storeroom, I had only just wanted to get away from Maggie. Sighing deeply, I made my way back to the  counter, tying my hair up into a messy bun with the rubber band in which I had found laying around at the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some people just couldn&#39;t live peacefully, I thought, my mind drifting back to Maggie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour into my shift at de Morgan&#39;s cafe, the customers had began to occupy the seats, and I attended to them. Most of them whom were business men who had no wives to make them coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had just brewed another cup of coffee, wiping the sweat that had tickled down my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing it onto a saucer, I proceeded to place it onto a tray, heading towards a table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the table, I unloaded the coffee, smiling at the man who had raised his head from his phone to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading back to the counter, I clutched the tray to my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed as I got behind the counter, dropping the tray. I had no other customer to serve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat, my eyes looking dead as I stared at nowhere in particular. I could tell my flushed face appeared smoother because of the sweat that had coated it. A strand of hair stuck to my sweaty face in which I lazily tucked behind my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For what seemed like hours, I sat unmoving as the customers slowly lessened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the cafe turned empty. The sky had turned dark, and the sun had hid beneath the sky. The keys clinked and clanked as I locked the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back on the closed doors, my eyes closed,  putting myself together before sighing deeply and opening my eyes. How had I gotten so exhausted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking in the direction of my home, I let my blonde hair loose from the rubber band that had kept it together in a messy bun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hair sprung free, dancing in the wind that blew through the night as I dragged my feet tiredly over the side walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly halted, my head whipping back only to find a woman whom had been following me for a while now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf had screamed for me to run, but I had merely took it casual. Perhaps the woman was going my direction too? I thought as I looked for a possible excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pace quickened despite the fatigue that had began to kick in furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of heels hitting the ground in a faster pace pierced through my ears, and I soon realized I was truly being followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run!&#34; I heard my wolf say at the back of my mind, and I picked up pace, running in the night as the figure pursued after me.</p>
