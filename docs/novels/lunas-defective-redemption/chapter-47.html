                <p>The night had finally arrived. I had clad myself in a tuxedo, and now as the woman whom I had chosen as a companion stood before me, I felt the least impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha.&#34; She called out, bowing her head, and I nodded in acknowledgement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, we headed for willow crest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driving into the mansion, We stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes moved to look at the fleet of cars that had littered the compound, and my gaze finally rested onto the fountain that had been lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning my head, my gaze landed onto the woman whom I had come along with, her eyes staring around in bewilderment. She had probably not been to a banquet before, I snorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both walked in to be greeted by the many people that crowded the beautifully decorated hall. People of mostly elites who had clad themselves expensively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivon.&#34; A masculine voice called out from behind me, and I turned to see Chase walking towards me, a woman beside him, a smile plastered across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chase was a childhood friend whom had been with I and Richie but had rarely hung out due to work in the human realm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Long time no see.&#34; I said, a smirk coming to rest on my face, and he chuckled amusingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was just last week we saw each other, Vivon.&#34; He pointed out, and the smirk did not leave my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, is that right?&#34; I asked, stroking my chin, seemingly in thought, and he shook his head, feeling helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Might this be your mate?&#34; He asked, Hus gaze moving to rest on the woman who stood beside me, and I turned to see her cheeks grow red. It irked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Came my curt reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah...I see.&#34; Responded chase, his gaze moving away from her to the woman beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Alvira, my mate.&#34; He said, his lips curling up into a slight smile, and I caught the mirth that shone in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s an honor to meet you here, Alpha Vivon.&#34; She said, bowing her head, and I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See you around.&#34; Chase said, pulling his mate along with him as they walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was about to walk, the old alpha&#39;s voice came behind me, and I turned to see he and his daughter walking towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha.&#34; The woman beside me called out once they reached us, bowing her head in respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had not expected you to come.&#34; Alpha Mortimer said, and a smile came to rest on my lips as I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows?&#34; Came his. words, feigning innocence, and my eyes moved to rest on Vera whom had clad herself in a beautiful red dress, a jewelry hanging from her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to see you again, Vera.&#34; I said, feigning ignorance about the fact that she had cone to visit me once and got kicked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too.&#34; She responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have a nice time.&#34; Alpha Mortimer said, and I offered him a smile as he walked away, leaving Vera behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes moved to rest on my companion, and I smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivon.&#34; She called out, her eyes moving to rest on me and my brows raised questioningly, a smile on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How heartless can you be rejecting your mate while she is pregnant?&#34; She asked, and I felt something tug at my heart at her question. My smile had not faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how exactly might that be your concern, Vera?&#34; I asked, tilting my head, the smile continuing to rest on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you not feel tormented?&#34; She asked, and by the time, my smile had faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe you know you are speaking to an alpha?&#34; I asked, and she snorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not my alpha.&#34; She said, walking away, and I smirked despite the uncomfortable feeling in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The banquet continued, and I had sat at a table, my eyes scanning around. My companion had vanished. Vera would occasionally glance at me from where she ushered the guests, redirecting her gaze almost immediately I look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More into the ball, the dance floor had been opened, couples twirling along with the music as it played.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I have this dance?&#34; A feminine voice pierced through my ears, and I turned to meet the bright smile of a woman who had clad herself in a yellow dress, it&#39;s neck low enough for her cleavage to peek out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the smoothness of her milky skin, feeling the urge to run my hands on her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; I said. She might not have known who I was as she had been fearless enough to ask an alpha to the dancefloor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapping her arms around my neck, I pulled her close, earning a gasp from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We twirled in the dancefloor, getting lost until the music had stopped and couples had returned to mingle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice dance you are, sir.&#34; She commented, and I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had walked in the mansion, the starry night sky up above our heads. I noticed as she shivered from the wind that had brushed passed her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can keep you warm.&#34; I said, my voice coming out hoarse from the feeling of my member trying to escape it&#39;s restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gasp pierced through my ears as I pushed her against the wall in the dark corner, my nose coming to her neck as I sniffed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tongue trailed down her neck to the two peaches that rested on her chest and she sighed at the feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I trailed down her skin, kissing and biting on it, earning gasps and sighs from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling the zipper that rested at the front of her dress, I had freed the mountains, and I watched them jiggle. Feeling them with my hands, I squeezed them, bringing my mouth down on one of the buds, and I earned a gasp from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finished with my administrations on her body, I raised her dress where she had worn nothing underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are such a bad girl, Isabel&#34; I commented, rubbing on her wet sex before freeing my member, burying it inside her on a huge thrust, earning a cry from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thrust into her over and over, her cry piercing through my ears like sweet music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One last thrust, her final cry came, and I emptied my seed inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking my eyes, I stared at the woman in front of me. She did not have the hazel eyes that I had seen earlier. She was not Isabel. Feeling the anger that had began to cloud me, I spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening to me? I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had I been hallucinating?.</p>
