                <p>I sat, having spoonfuls of porridge as I watched Alex. He had been surprisingly quiet since he got back, it made me wonder what he might be thinking. Sneaking glances at him from under my eyes, he finally stared up directly at me, the usual mischievousness coming to settle in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure enjoy staring at my handsome face, don&#39;t you?&#34; he asked, and I puckered up my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay though?&#34; I asked, dropping the playfulness in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, why wouldn&#39;t I be?&#34;  He asked, continuing to stare at me as I put a spoonful of porridge in my mouth, chewing carefully, my eyes resting onto him. It had not been a lot of time I had known him, but I guess it would not hurt to have one human friend. Who knew what my wolf would think about having a human friend. It made me laugh at its possible reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you there?&#34; I mind linked it, but there wasn&#39;t any response, made me wonder if it was asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How come you&#39;re always spacing out when you are with me?&#34; I heard Alex&#39;s voice come, piercing through the many. thoughts that went through my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or do you find me enchanting?&#34; He asked again, a smirk coming to rest on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In your dreams.&#34; I said, rolling my eyes and it made him chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really okay?&#34; I asked again, and he went silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm.&#34; He hummed, nodding his head, and by this time we had both went silent as neither of us had anything to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Alex.&#34; I said, breaking through the awkward silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For having me here despite your girlfriend&#39;s obvious disapproval. I would have had no where else to go.&#34; I added, my gaze lowering. Sure, I was a werewolf, but it did not mean that I would want to be hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s no problem. We have become friends now, haven&#39;t we?&#34; I heard him ask, and I smiled, feeling grateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; I said, and the silence prevailed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really were no peaceful Lady when I met you. I bet you might have been thinking of ways to murder me when I asked you to sit with me.&#34; He said, chuckling, and I shrugged my shoulder in approval...he wasn&#39;t entirely wrong. He had acted like a maniac, smirking like a jerk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did act like a jerk.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had thought you and your girlfriend were hired killers as she had talked about poisoning me. She is such a weirdo.&#34; A huge weirdo, I thought in my mind. She had dug deep into my background, it made me wonder if I should consider being a celebrity. Was my past life so important to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is always like that.&#34; Alex stated casually, picking up the cup of water that sat to his side and taking a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How old are you?&#34; I asked, my curiosity getting the best of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A thousand years.&#34; He replied, his mischievous gaze landing onto me and I rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I probably would be a thousand years older than you are.&#34;  I said, earning a hearty chuckle from Alex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still haven&#39;t told me about your family.&#34; He said, his chuckle dying down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, emotions flickering in my eyes. I could feel the huge weight that had been placed on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My parents are...dead.&#34; I said, my voice coming out in a whisper. It was the truth. My parents had been murdered, and I had been forced to stay with my aunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So sorry about that.&#34; his voice came and I smiled sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s fine.&#34;  I said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about my job at the cafe?&#34; I asked, my gaze falling onto Alex who stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I took care of it...you won&#39;t work there anymore, at least not when someone is after your well being.&#34; Alex said, and I felt my heart sink. My life was bound to have negativities wasn&#39;t it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was the moon goddess still punishing me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, my eyes moving to my plate of porridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day went by faster than I thought, and Alex had headed out, leaving me all alone in the apartment. I had been bored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling the door open, I headed out, my footsteps hitting the ground. I had never been to this side of the city, and it was rather a place for the rich. How rich was Alex? I thought as I continued to walk without a direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The art like buildings all made my mind drift back to Avid mars. The buildings there were as beautiful as these. Walking more, I had came across a shop in which I decided to enter. I did not have money, and I knew I should not have entered the shop, but I did anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the glass door open, I had walked in, my eyes being greeted by the fancy paintings that were hung up on the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could pick one that suites your taste, ma&#39;am.&#34; The woman whom had been the attendant said, smiling as her perfect white teeth came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling slightly, I made my way to where many paintings had been stacked, each one of them holding a unique element. I had walked for a while when my eyes had caught a painting that rested to a side of the stack, as though it had been forgotten. Walking towards it, my hand reached for it, my fingers trailing it&#39;s surface. It was the painting of a white wolf with blue flames coming out of its eyes. It made my heart tug, as it looked harmless, yet there was an aura to the flame in it&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, I had wanted to leave, but I had bumped into something real hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch.&#34; I whined rubbing my forehead. I sure did have a fetish for bumping into things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring up, I had been met with a pair of pale blue eyes, and my breath hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Klinn?&#34;</p>
