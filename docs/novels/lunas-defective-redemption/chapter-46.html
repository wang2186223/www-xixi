                <p>I sat on the sofa, twirling the glass of wine in my hand as my eyes rested onto the flickering flames of the fire that burned in the fireplace. It had been a month since I had rejected Isabel, and I felt my heart become hollow by the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now as I took a sip from the glass, I felt the familiar emotion of longing fill my heart. I did not like to feel this way, but I could not help it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing that she was carrying our child made my heart tug involuntarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feeling miserable?&#34; Richie&#39;s voice came as his footsteps echoed in the vast living room. He had made his way towards where I sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you have someone spy on her.&#34; Richie suggested, and it piqued my attention. Perhaps I could do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning, my eyes followed him as he sunk onto the sofa opposite me, crossing his legs as he sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have you been doing, Vivon?&#34; He asked, and I rolled my eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious I am not okay?&#34; I asked, some irritation weaving into my voice, and he caught it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chill.&#34; He said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps all you need is a woman. Why don&#39;t you try giving Vera a chance, who knows... you two might be compatible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you hear yourself right now?&#34; I asked feeling irritated by his suggestion. Vera was someone I could never love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing wrong in trying, Vivon.&#34; He said, and I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>i</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides, Vera isn&#39;t so bad looking, is she?&#34; He asked no one in particular, and I turned, my eyes moving from my glass to rest on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me something, Richie...Had she done something to make you come talk to me?&#34; I asked, seeing no reason why he would be speaking up for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chuckle erupted throughout the room, and I stared at him, my brows raising questioningly as I continued to stare at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are over thinking.&#34; He stated, his eyes resting on his nails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence prevailed as neither of us had the words to say. I took sip after sip, my thoughts wandering to his suggestion. Perhaps I could have someone watch her from the human realm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gulping down the last bit of wine, I proceeded to pour some more into my glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that bad for your health?&#34; Richie asked, and I could feel his gaze on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We both know alcohol cannot kill me. Not unless it was poised with wolfsbane.&#34; I responded lazily, turning to look at Richie who&#39;s face had been marred by a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should leave now.&#34; Came my curt words, and his smirk fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you seriously going to kick me out now?&#34; He asked, but I ignored him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do realize the banquet is tomorrow.&#34; He said, and my thoughts wandered again. Vera&#39;s father had invited me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing deeply, I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re attending then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; came my short reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should go and find a woman to accompanying me, you should do the same.&#34; Richie said, and I stared at him blankly as he rose to his feet, winking at me before walking out, his footsteps echoing until it faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed a companion myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will be my companion for the banquet tomorrow.&#34; I said, my voice reverberating throughout the room, and she bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be honored to be your companion, alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, feeling that she was no match for Isabel. But what could I do when Isabel was far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may leave and come back tomorrow.&#34; I said, and she bowed before turning around and walking out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed, and then minutes, but I had only sat on the bed staring into space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha.&#34; A voice came from behind my closed door, but I had not bothered to glance at it&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34; I said, and the door creaked open, a man entering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have brought your meal.&#34; He said, and I waved my hand in the air, motioning for him to leave as soon as he was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing the food on the table that rested to a side of the room, he walked out, closing the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting out of the bed, I walked towards the table where I sat on the sofa close to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening the plate, my eyes zeroed onto the large piece of fresh meat that rested on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my eyes flicker back and forth between brown and amber, and I felt my hunger curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up the meat, I brought it to my mouth, taking a huge bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bite after bite, I was finally done having my meal. Walking to the bathroom, I sunk myself into the bath where I felt myself relax. For what seemed like hours I stared in the bath until the water had began to turn cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out of the bath, I wrapped myself up in a bathrobe, retiring to the room where I got dressed in some loose clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling in the bed, I picked up my phone from the bedside, dialing a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; The voice came from the other end after the third ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to help me with something.&#34; I said, and he hummed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you find out Isabella&#39;s location?&#34; I asked, and he turned quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I think I could do that.&#34; He said after a minute of silence, and I felt relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me until tomorrow.&#34; He said, and I hummed in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disconnecting the call, I clutched my phone tightly in my hand, feeling emotions surge through my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sucking in a breath, I placed the phone on the bedside, my head hitting the pillow as my eyes rested onto the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had stared for what seemed like hours until I felt my eyes become droopy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing my eyes, I drifted off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning came, and the chatter downstairs woke me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw red under my eyes from the sunlight that shone through the window, and my eyes soon fluttered open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting off of the bed, I made my way to the bathroom where a bath had been prepared for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I peeled the clothes off my body, feeling the water tingle my skin as I sunk into the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight was the banquet, I thought. And the chances of me not meeting Vera was thin. In the end, I was going to face her again, something I did not want.</p>
