                <p>&#34;Do you not acknowledge me, Kinn?&#34; I heard her say, with a pain evident in her voice that had began to crack. My heart clenched beneath my chest as I stared at her, her cheeks stained with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was trying to understand, wracking my brain for answers.</p>

                <p>&#34;Tell me you want me out of your life, Kinn...reject me to my face.&#34; her voice  came again. and by this time I had risen to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fisting my hand into my hair, I clutched it tightly as if to rip it from my head, to get the answers or clues to what I was missing. The pain in my chest multiplied as I tried to understand her words. The very words that finally shook me.</p>

                <p>I stood frozen to the spot, had she left?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crouching down, I clutched my chest tightly as the pain had become unbearable. I could feel the wetness in the corners of my eyes as I tried to breathe. What was the feeling? rejection?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever it was, I fought to overcome it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally pulling myself together, I stood to my feet, running out of the room intending to stop her from leaving. I couldn&#39;t let her just leave like that? I felt  a pit in my stomach as I thought of the dangers that lurked in the streets. Even if she was a werewolf, it could not assure her safety, or her safety for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jumped in front of a bus for God&#39;s sake, what if she does worse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alighting the stares hurriedly, I was met with David who stood frozen to a spot, staring at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir.&#34; He called out, jolting out of his reverie by my footsteps that thumped the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a meeting in an hour.&#34; He began, but I cut him off as I walked pass him, waving my hand in the air in dismissal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cancel my schedule for today.&#34; I said, my voice laced with determination, I was going to bring her back!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S..sir?&#34; I heard him ask as he walked hurriedly behind me, uncertainty creeping it&#39;s way up his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cancel it!&#34; I repeated, and by this time I had reached my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at David with a grave expression, I got into the car, starting the engine and driving out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drove along the streets, my head whipping back and forth from left to right, but I had not caught a glimpse of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stopping the car, I clutched the steering wheel hard, and I could feel my knuckles turn white. It was my fault. I had still hurt her even if I honestly didn&#39;t know what she had been talking about. Resting my head face down on the steering wheel, my eyes rested onto the floor, seemingly staring at it, but my thoughts had traveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I dialed the one person whom could help me...Grimm Antonio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered on the third ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; His voice reverberated from the other end, piercing through my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I have a session with you right now?&#34; I asked, my voice barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right now?&#34; I heard him ask, sounding unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right now.&#34; I affirmed, and there was silence on the other end. Taking the silence for a yes, I ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Starting the car, I drove off to Grimm&#39;s office muddle headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you feel, Kinn?&#34; I heard Grimm ask, and my head raised to stare at him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Weird.&#34; I replied curtly. All the feelings I felt all were foreign to me. I had tried to understand Isabelle, but it felt as though I was missing something. It felt like there were some part of myself that I do not feel...like a part of me was dormant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm.&#34; Grimm hummed, nodding his head in understanding and I turned to look at him again. by this time he had began to stroke his chin seemingly in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You feel as though something is missing?&#34; he asked, his green eyes resting onto my face and I nodded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since when had you begun to feel this void?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ever since I met her.&#34; I replied, my eyes shone unfathomable emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it&#39;s a woman then.&#34; I heard Grimm mutter to himself, and although he had said it under his breath, I had caught it very lucid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She makes you feel emotions you have never felt, am I right?&#34; Grimm asked again as he scribbled something onto the book that rested on his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes darted to his moving hand, not answering the question, and his eyes that were on the notebook shifted to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I replied, not knowing where the conversation was heading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you perhaps held her, touched her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mean skin contact?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; I answered again, trying to get his point</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you feel anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Well, that&#39;s one thing that confused me for a while you see, I thought it was all in my head&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, we were starting to connect</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did it feel like?&#34; he asked again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like tingles, but in a nice warm way. Something you would always want to feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This happens only when I touch her and only her, believe me, I have tried it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were to be a soothsayer, I would deduce the mysterious woman to be your soulmate.&#34; Grimm said pulling his glasses away from in between his nose like he had solved one big puzzle. He chuckled wearily and I stared at him with the same expression... deadpan!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Okay...jokes apart...&#34; Grimm said, raising both hands in the air seemingly to surrender, but his expression was contradicting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curled into a smirk as he stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adjusted the little strands of his gray hair that had come loose from the bun he always packed each time I met with him, behind his ear and some brushed back up in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze soon turned serious, the atmosphere in the room dropping by a few degrees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the door pierced through my ears, cutting into the glaciers that had enveloped the room. And just then, a lady could be seen walking in. She was dressed in a casual flair dress that had been buried under the white coat she had worn. Pushing her round glasses up the bridge of her nose, her amber eyes rested onto me, before moving to stare at Grimm who stared questioningly at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing her throat, she said...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are needed Sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grimm nodded, and turning to me, he said...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will reschedule this session.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he left with the Lady who looked to me like a doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat, my thoughts wandering to what Grimm had said earlier. Could it be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it the reason she had the ability to spike me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massaging the space between my brows, Grimm&#39;s words repeated in my mind...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soulmate?</p>
