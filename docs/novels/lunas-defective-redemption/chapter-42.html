                <p>I alighted the car once we got to the office, heading into the building where David awaits me by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is not here yet, sir.&#34; He said, following behind me as I walked towards the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Entering, the door closed, and I picked up my phone from my pocket, my eyes resting onto the lit screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long until the appointment?&#34; I asked, my gaze not leaving my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An hour, sir.&#34; Answered David and I nodded my head, my eyes finally leaving the phone screen to rest on the closed door of the elevator, placing the phone back into my pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like coffee, sir?&#34; David asked and I nodded. Indeed, I would like some coffee as I had not had breakfast before coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened with a ding, and I stepped out if the elevator, David following behind me as I walked to my office where I pushed the glass door open, walking in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping the documents on my desk, he had gone to get me coffee. Somewhere in my heart, I was relieved to have him back. And not that woman whom had been his substitute while he was gone. Her perfume gave me an unsettling feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up the documents, my eyes scanned through them until David&#39;s footsteps echoed in the room again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing the cup on the table, my eyes had subconsciously moved to look at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked it up, bringing it close to my lips where I took a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may leave now.&#34; I said, waving my hand and motioning for him to leave, and I caught his words as he mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you still need your job, David?&#34; I asked when he was about to leave, and he stuttered, knowing fully well I had heard his earlier words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes...sir.&#34; He replied, pulling the door open and walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed, and then minutes, and it was finally time for my appointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David had informed me that the head of sales of the investing company had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked to the meeting room where I found a woman waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, my name is Margaret Morgan.&#34; She said, stretching out her hand for a handshake in which I accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to meet you.&#34; I said, staring at the woman who&#39;s name was Margaret. She looked to be in her mid twenties, her dirty blonde hair styled richly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Done with the formalities, we sat, discussing the new game. For what seemed like hours, we discussed until the last moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It would be best if you let skyrise do the launching, as you see, skyrise is part of the top 20 most reputable companies here in New York.&#34; she said, offering a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lest you forget, skyrise has only just invested in this.&#34; I responded, my gaze expressionless as I stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should think about it over the weekend, Mr Ethan.&#34; She said, her smile not wavering as she got up to her feet, heading out as David led her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the space in front of me, my gaze hardening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need anything, sir?&#34; David asked once he came back, but I ignored him, rising to my feet as I headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What other schedule do I have today?&#34; I asked as I walked towards the elevator, David following behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The finalizing of the contract with Sun Tech, sir.&#34; He answered, and I nodded, handing him the documents in which I had been holding, entering the elevator without him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day soon slowly passed by and I was finally done with my schedules for the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I head for the elevator and stood for seconds until the ding pierced through my ears. I had reached the ground floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I walked to the garage where I found the car waiting for me. Getting in, I headed for the cafe in which Grimm had texted me to meet him at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole ride was quiet as I thought of Isabel. I figured I had no way to contact her, and I wondered why she did not have a phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have arrived.&#34; The chauffeur announced, cutting into the trains of thoughts that had clouded my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out if the car, I proceeded to walk into the cafe, my eyes searching until it fell onto the man who was sitting on a deserted table, seemingly enjoying a glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some example you are to your patients.&#34; I said once I reached him, referring the the glass of wine in which had had taken a sip from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how much I love wine, Klinn.&#34; He said, shrugging his shoulder and I pulled out a chair, settling onto it as I rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are always non alcoholic ones, I&#39;m case you forgot.&#34; I said, and he chuckled heartily. Grimm was unlike me, a smile marrying his face always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tsk...always so ready to crucify me when I am trying so hard to get you back to normal.&#34; He said, clicking his tongue as he shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to look at me, he had shut his mouth at my glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, no more jokes.&#34; He said, and I was ready to listen to whatever he needed to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has any new emotion spiked?&#34; He asked, and I nodded, my gaze getting serious. Our last therapy session had been interrupted by a doctor whom had stole Grimm away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same woman?&#34; He asked, and I nodded again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes followed him as he pulled out a book and a pen from his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything else?&#34; He asked, opening the book and scribbling something on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A voice.&#34; I said, and he raised his head to stare at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A voice in my head. I had thought I had been hallucinating as I heard it first when I was drunk, but it came again.&#34; I said, my gaze not wavering from looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did it say?&#34; Grimm asked, and I was about to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need anything sir.&#34; feminine voice pierced through my ears, and I turned to see the waitress who had interrupted us, waiting for my order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; I said, and she nodded walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mate.&#34; I replied to Grimm&#39;s earlier question, and I did not miss the glint that flickered in his eyes before it vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is not the right place to have this session.&#34; Grimm said, his gaze hardening and I nodded. Perhaps it was a serious situation than I had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chatting with Grimm for a little while, I headed out of the cafe to the car where I got in, driving home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared out of the window as the car made it&#39;s way through the city, the orange and purple rays of sunset painting the horizon.</p>
