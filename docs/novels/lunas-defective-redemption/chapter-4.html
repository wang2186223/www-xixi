                <p>Klinn&#39;s POV...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her standing by the side of the road, her eyes frozen as she stared at nothingness in the distance. I stood still, hoping to understand why she was making that action- Her eyes suddenly flashed a golden brown. I was afraid to blink in case I was making things up in my mind. But that wasn&#39;t the case as, at this moment, the gold in her eyes still lingered. I wouldn&#39;t be mistaken about my kind. She was a werewolf, just like me, in the human territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled. If that was the case, I didn&#39;t have to worry about her. Our awkward meeting near the HR office in the company had me worried about her. She&#39;d just left with that haphazard expression on her face. I remembered the warmth in her hands when she touched me back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tingling sensation her touch gave me It was foreign but it gave me a warm feeling. One I&#39;d never felt before. However, I was not confident to chase the fleeting feeling, I could just be making things up in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My name is Klinn Ethan Adams and I was born with a defect. One that opposed the very sensitivity of werewolves, I could not feel emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I took a stride forward, I heard a long bang and soon followed the pungent scent of blood. Something in me sparked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned back in the direction of the road and saw that a bus had hastily pulled over near the pedestrian spot and across from it was the bloody arm of a woman hanging above a ditch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the world around me dimmed and I heard the quiet voice of my wolf alarming me. Without thinking, I ran to the side of the ditch and when I saw the face of the woman laying in there, something in me dried up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hhow?&#34; I muttered to myself. This woman was a werewolf and she was obviously with child. She could escape even the fastest bus here in the human territory, then how? Or rather, why? Why would she try to take her life and that of her child-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I muttered as I sensed the secondary blood pouring out of the woman. The child was dead. And just when it was beginning to grow stronger I heard her heartbeat, desperately pounding hard and strongly. Somehow that was enough to throw some sense back into me. I immediately threw my hands into the ditch and scooped her gently within my grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted her from the ground and only then did I notice the gathering crowd. The reckless bus driver was being held by a couple of people so he didn&#39;t leave. I couldn&#39;t be bothered by these fallacies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call the police!&#34; I yelled and as I walked into the surrounding crowd they parted the road for me to pass but I heard a concerned voice ask, &#34;Where are you taking her? The ambulance isn&#39;t here yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hospital,&#34; I reply loudly, &#34;If we wait any longer, she&#39;ll die.&#34; With that, I hurried away from the roadside until I was at a spot they wouldn&#39;t see. Then, I used my wolf&#39;s speed to move us quickly to my car that was parked right in front of Trident company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to the spot with the woman in my arms, my driver, Eric, gave me a concerned stare. &#34;Boss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t ask any questions, give me the car keys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;-Keys,&#34; I demanded, scaring him with my icy blue gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly dipped his hands in his pocket and handed me the keys. I snatched it from him and held the woman with an arm while I unlocked the car. I placed her in the passenger&#39;s seat and got into the driver&#39;s before speeding to the nearest hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived at the hospital, the woman was taken in for treatment. Before I could catch a break from my concern, I was called over to fill out a form for the woman as her guardian and I was more than willing to because we had one thing in common. We were werewolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that also made me uncomfortable. Just how long would it take until she saw the truth about me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My destitute in feeling emotions. Also, I could not hear my wolf&#39;s voice. Or rather, it was blocked. That&#39;s how I&#39;d lived over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wasn&#39;t that bad because I had a therapist. His name was Grimm Antonio. He taught me basic human emotions and the characteristics most human interaction required, which was a sunny jovial expression. So that was what I did in most of the settings I found myself in. That was also how I made it to the top as the CEO of Trident company and maintained many relationships.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, it wasn&#39;t enough to keep a sunny expression around this woman. Even though I deny it, she did give me a feeling I never thought existed before. What&#39;s more, she was a werewolf and a woman. She had more sensitivity than others. I had to learn how to behave around her so she didn&#39;t find out about my defect and blame me for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slipped my phone out of my pocket and dialed the number of the one man I didn&#39;t save on my phone but always went to when I wasn&#39;t sure of people&#39;s feelings and reactions toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Klinn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always knew it was me when I called, which I found slightly strange. He was a psychiatrist and a therapist, didn&#39;t he have better things to do than to answer my call in one ring? Also, did he save my number on his phone? How charming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grimm Antonio, I may need a session from you this week, when are you free?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whenever you are, Klinn. You know that.&#34; He said the last part in a quieter tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then, I&#39;ll see you tomorrow at twelve noon, how does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect.&#34; He answered. I was about to end the call when I heard his voice in the background. &#34;Mikey, push back the appointment I have tomorrow at twelve pm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But sir, the client is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;-Shut it and just do as I say!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir,&#34; I looked up at the nurse that had just arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to see your girlfriend? She&#39;s pretty livid about losing the baby, she says she wants to kill herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me to her,&#34; I said hurriedly and the nurse led me down the hall.</p>
