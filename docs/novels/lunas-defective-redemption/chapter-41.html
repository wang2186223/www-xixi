                <p>Klinn&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like a dream when I met her at the antique shop. I had thought that I would never get to see her again, but it looked like God had plans for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared up at the ceiling, my gaze focused on its texture, yet my mind was elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had settled in the room opposite mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts had wandered until the knock on the door pierced through my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34; I commanded, not glancing at the door, and a maid walked in just as the door creaked open. I turned to see her bow her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dinner will be ready in five minutes, sir.&#34; She said, and I nodded my head in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as she left, and I finally got off of the bed, going to the bathroom and splashing some water on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes landed onto the closed door of the room opposite mine, and I had the urge to push the door open in order to check what she was up to, but I decided against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on the door a couple of times, earning no response and I finally turned the handle, pushing the door open as I walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isabel?&#34; I called out as my eyes scanned the empty room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving to the bathroom, I pushed the door open, but she was not there either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of the room, I alighted the stairs hurriedly. Where had she gone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was scared to think that she had left again. But why would she leave, I thought as I continued to alight the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen her?&#34; I asked a maid that had passed by as soon as I reached the end of the stairs, and she stared at me, confusion marred her face before it morphed into realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, yes. I had seen madam walk into the dining room.&#34; She said, and I walked towards the dinning room, not sparing the maid another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into the room to see her standing with a maid, and I felt my heartbeat slow down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34; I asked, coming to stand beside Isabel. I had noticed the air that had begun to brew between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing much.&#34; Isabel said, and my gaze turned to look at her where she shrugged her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the meal ready yet.&#34; I questioned, and the maid nodded</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No worries.&#34; I heard Isabel say, and the maid nodded, leaving the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at Isabel, feeling a tug at my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already acting like a madam, are we?&#34; I asked, a smirk coming to rest on my face. An expression that I had perfected over time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling her eyes, she pulled out a chair in which she sat, and I followed suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, dinner was served, and we began to eat, neither of us saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal, I watched as she retired to her room, and I headed for my room an hour later, after I had taken a walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a bath, letting the water hit my body, and when I was done, I changed into a new pair of clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of the room, I decided to see how Isabel was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed her room door open, the creaking sound reverberating throughout the entire hallway. I walked in to see her standing, a troubled expression marrying her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I asked as I walked into the room, my questioning gaze landing on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no clothes to wear.&#34; She said, and her gaze travelled to the clothes in which she had been wearing earlier as it laid on the bed. My gaze followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me.&#34; I said as I led her to my room where I had stacked some female clothes in my closet. I had done them in advance as I had not gotten the right closet for her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out a pair of pyjamas from the wardrobe, I turned around, handing them over to her, and I saw the glint of astonishment that flickered in her eyes before it vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; She said, taking the clothes and heading out of my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as she closed the door behind her, and I stared on for a couple of minutes before tearing my gaze away from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked to the bed where I had sunk onto it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared into space, sleep far away from me until the sound of my ringing phone pierced through my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up the phone that rested onto the side table, putting it to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Took you long enough.&#34; Grimm said from the other end, and I stared expressionlessly into space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; I asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t sound happy that I called.&#34; He said, and I was sure I was about to roll my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About the seminar...have you thought about it?&#34; He asked, and I felt an emotion envelope me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; He called out when I kept mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will go.&#34; I said, my expression turning serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not know what emotions were, but ever since Isabel had come into my life, she had forced them out of me. Things that I had never felt. The breathless feeling when she was absent. Her ability to control what I felt left me perplexed, and I had made up my mind to find out what they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;ll be coming then?&#34; Grimm asked, cutting into my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I will.&#34; I responded, and I heard Grimm chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly is up with you, Klinn?&#34; He asked, and I did not say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When is the seminar again?&#34; I asked, ignoring his question and he proceeded to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s next week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Came my short reply, and I ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I proceeded to call David who had told me my schedules for tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are to meet the head of sales of the skyrise industries and finalize the contract with Sun Tech. Industries. The contract signing is the first thing in the morning sir, and I&#39;m afraid you will have to be here as early as possible if you want to meet up with the clients sir.&#34; He said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir. Your only appointments for tomorrow&#34; came his reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, very well then, see you tomorrow.&#34; I said and ended the call, placing the phone on the side table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at the ceiling for a while longer, I soon drifted off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes fluttered open, and I turned to see the table clock hit 5:00 AM in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting out of bed, exercised, freshened up, and changed into a black long sleeve shirt in which I had tucked under a black pants, a blue tie hanging from my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting on my suit, I clad my feet in some shoes, walking out of the house. I headed for the car where my driver Eric had been waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Entering the car, he drove off.</p>
