                <p>My plan at this moment in the human realm was half-assed because it was quite simple. I had money to sustain my life for two months so I was going to stay put for that long until an idea came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the incognizant voice of the wind as it blew my hair back causing me to halt in my step, with my lips parted open and eyes frozen in attention. I felt a light leaf fall on my shoulder and I turned to glance at the brown leaf that reeked of autumn. I grabbed the leaf and my lips curved up in a smile. I didn&#39;t know why either but it just felt as though the future had something surprising to offer me. I wasn&#39;t sure what it could be, but I hoped it was something pleasant that could fill up the hole in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One month later***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had thought I was going to stay in my rented apartment until an idea on what to do with my life struck, but nothing went my way. At least, not in the way I expected, because I found out that I was pregnant. With Vivion&#39;s baby of course, I never cheated on him. Now, I had to worry about something else other than my heartbreak. It was funny the way life worked but it couldn&#39;t be helped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in weeks, I decided to go out. Not for myself but for the growing being in me. It was surprising to me that even though my current mental state was weak, the knowledge of a being, dependent on me to live was enough to get me out of the stuck mess of my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleaned myself and wore black pants and put on an orange button up fluffy textured shirt then I stepped out into the busy streets. I had no idea how the human world worked because I hadn&#39;t gotten out to observe and socialize but from what I could see on the walls and poles were countless advertisements showcasing jobs to be applied for. Amongst so many, one caught my fancy. The name of the company was Trident and they were hiring for management.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the address on the signpost and found my way there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got past security somehow and got information on where the interview for management would hold by listening with my ultrasonic-sensitive ears. I learned quickly and got into the elevator and found the area by listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I made to open the door and get in, a security guard appeared and blocked my sight. &#34;You&#39;re not allowed in unless you were called over for an interview,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at the gruff man and gave him a gentle smile to ease his guard. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I was called over for an interview. Why else would I be here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard hesitatingly opened the door and I held back my smirk as I stepped in only to see two well-groomed men sitting behind a well-polished desk with several rows of documents in their hands while three participants sat on singular chairs, their heart rates a little higher than usual calm humans. I swept them over my gaze with a glance before staring at the interviewers who gave me a confused expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi everyone, my name Is Isabelle and I&#39;m here for the interview.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re on the list-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;-Instead of worrying about such naivety, why not give me a test right here, right now?&#34; I looked at them with my chin up, &#34;I have experience managing financial records and humans- I mean, people.&#34; It was true. When I worked at the club as a dancer, I had to learn to politely decline nasty men who wanted to have their way with me, so that could count, in a way, as people management. And regarding the financial records part, I had no idea but it didn&#39;t really matter, did it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss, you&#39;re causing a scene. Security!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-but I have experience!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then prove it!&#34; The older man with gray hair stood on his feet, looking at me with his light blue eccentric eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; I asked a little quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send your CV to the company and come when the company invites you.&#34; He said as though it was the most basic thing ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the door open and before I knew it, I was dragged out by the security guard from earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please wait!&#34; I yelled, but it was no good as the door to the interview room shut in my face. The guard dragged me off to the exit by the corner and gave me a distasteful glare, &#34;I should&#39;ve known you were a fraud, almost made me lose my job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H-hey&#34; Before I could find words to defend myself he was already far gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed and turned around to leave. Perhaps, I needed more practice regarding human societal constructs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step towards the exit when the most delicious scent that I&#39;d never smelt before filled my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze in my steps, bewildered and reminiscent of the feeling as it made its way through my heart, shattering the tiny towers I managed to build on fake foundations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door to the exit opened and I was faced with the most beautiful man I&#39;d ever seen, my man. He stood in front of me, his glassy blue eyes staring into my eyes but I was too self-conscious to read his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds passed, my heart was completely vulnerable and my wolf was yearning to be held by him to fill the sacred space Vivion left after rejecting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To confirm what I was feeling, I moved over to him and grabbed his right hand, and placed it on the upper top of my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not dreaming, right?&#34; I muttered to myself. Just the mere feeling of the skin of his arm intoxicated me and left me with a feeling of need. A need for his soul to connect with mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moon goddess gave me a second mate. I smiled.</p>
