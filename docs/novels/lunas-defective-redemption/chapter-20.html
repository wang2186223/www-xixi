                <p>Vera&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light from the open window hit my face, making me want to get way. The day had dawned, and I was sure it was going to be another boring day of my days in the Blood moon pack. I rolled on the bed, feeling the furry white duvet brush my skin. I sighed deeply, sitting up on the bed. Rubbing my bleary eyes, I scanned the room, my eyes resting onto the door. I could here the chatter from downstairs, and it made me wonder what they were up to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling off the bed, I felt the cold floor under my feet, making me shiver involuntarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading to the bathroom, I sunk myself into the hot bath that had been prepared for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting my head backwards on the white tub, I closed my eyes, savoring the sweet scent of lavender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then a memory flashed behind my closed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Vivon.&#34; I said, staring at the man in front of me who continued to sip from the glass of wine he was holding, not paying any attention to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Vivon.&#34; I repeated, my eyes beginning to sting with tears, but he did not even spare me a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gulping down the wine in his hand, he stood to his feet from the date I had prepared, dusting his pants and walking away. I watched his back fade, the tears that had been clouding my vision beginning to pour. Why had he continued to hurt me like this, I asked myself as I let the tears pour. We had been betrothed before that slut came into the picture. We were okay, and Vivon had loved me. I stared at the direction in which he had left, my nails digging into my palm, the faint scent of blood filling my nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find someone else.&#34; I heard my wolf say in my head, and the anger I felt only multiplied at it&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up unless you want me to shut you up.&#34; I threatened, but it had only provoked me more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is not for you.&#34; My wolf said again, and by this time I had began to grit my teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; I yelled, and I had noticed all heads turn to my table, the humans giving me awkward stares, but I did not care. The lowly humans were the least of my concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming back to the present, the bath had began to turn cold. Getting out, I wrapped myself in a bathrobe and headed back to my room where I had dried my hair.  Getting dressed in a casual floral dress, I had been brushing my hair when a knock pierced through my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34; I said, not bothering to look at the door. It creaked open after I had heard it click, a lady walking in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes at who it was...Mildred, she was my personal maid, a lowly Omega.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was clad in a sunset yellow maid uniform, her hair tied into a bun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes rested onto the floor, not wanting to meet my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scion.&#34; She called out continuing to bow, and I felt my lips curl up in satisfaction. Exactly how an omega should behave. Looked like she had learned her place after our little lesson last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had brought you breakfast as you had not come down for breakfast.&#34; She said, rushing out only to push in a trolley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes followed her, and I could hear her heartbeat accelerate, to my utmost satisfaction. She was no different than a human with a second mind, I thought as I snorted. My face contoured in disgust, staring at her as she fiddled with the hem of her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling the trolley towards my bed, I sat, opening the dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up the utensils, I began to eat, cutting into the beef that sat on the plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chewing slowly, I felt the tender meat melt in my mouth, and my eyes moved to Mildred who was too scared to meet my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clicking my tongue, I asked...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard the loud chattering early this morning, what was it about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I felt the faint scent of blood hit my nostrils, she had bit her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, preparations are being made for the ball next week.&#34; She said, staring at the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm.&#34; I nodded my head as stuffed my mouth with more of the beef brisket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me something I don&#39;t know.&#34; I said, continuing to stuff my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Vivon Coming?&#34; I asked, my eyes resting onto her face and I saw her throat move slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...I... I have no idea of the invitations, Scion.&#34; I heard her say and I snorted. Of course, how would a mere omega know something so important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh...I forgot how stupid you are.&#34; I said, my eyes getting wide in realization, feigning ignorance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waving my hand, I motioned for her to leave my sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her turn around, walking towards the door, her worn out sandals glazing the tiled floor. And then she pulled the door open, walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the closed door, my thoughts wandering. Was the alpha going to invite Vivon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just then, my phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Magnus.&#34; I said as held the phone to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Princess. &#34; I heard, and I could imagine the mischievous smirk on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes as I continued to stuff my mouth, my hand still holding the phone to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t know about it yet?&#34; He asked, and I wondered what he was talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My source says Vivon had rejected his mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I asked, feeling perplexed, and by this time I had paused from eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I asked, and I know I was supposed to feel sorry for Vivon, but my heart rejoiced at the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got no clue.&#34; He said from the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I also heard that she is pregnant.&#34; He added, and my breath hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pregnant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clutched the phone in my hand tightly, not saying a word.</p>
