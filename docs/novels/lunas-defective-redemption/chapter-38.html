                <p>Alex&#39;s POV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked, my footsteps hitting the sidewalk, I had left home to clear my head, Leaving Isabel on her own. She can handle herself, I thought as I continued to walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared up at the sky, where orange and purple had painted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heaving a frustrated sigh, I continued to walk aimlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been embarrassed to talk about Mabel while i was with Isabel earlier as it was complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had asked me out a long time ago when we were still in highschool, and like a teenager, I had not thought about it and just said yes, hoping that it wouldn&#39;t be too bad. But I realized that I had not loved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts wandered as I continued to walk aimlessly on the street, until my phone vibrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out my phone, halting in my steps to stare at a message that had popped up on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from Mabel. My eyes moved as I read it, and my brows furrowed the more I read it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had asked me to meet her at a nearby cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the glass door open, I walked in, my eyes searching the tables until it rested onto the woman that sat alone on a deserted table, sipping from a glass of orange juice. I walked towards her, my gaze not leaving her face. Once I reached, I pulled out the chair opposite her, settling onto it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like a drink?&#34; She asked, stars shone in her eyes, but my smug look had not wavered. I bet she could tell I was not ready for tricks and needed her to get down to business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed the pout that had come to rest on her lips, but I did not care. All I needed  was for her to go straight to the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m pregnant.&#34; She finally said, and I did not miss the way she rubbed her tummy gently. What was she talking about? I thought as my gaze travelled to rest on her belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I asked, not sure if I had gotten her words clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m pregnant.&#34; She repeated, a smile coming to rest on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And it&#39;s yours.&#34; She added, her gaze moving to rest on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It cannot be.&#34; I stated, it couldn&#39;t be mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you imply that I am lying or cheating?&#34; She asked, her face contouring in anger, and she rose to her feet, gaining some attention from nearby tables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The child is yours. Do you really not believe me anymore because you found someone else?&#34; She said, and by this time, tears had run down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be a father to the child.&#34; I said, my gaze getting serious, and by now she had sat down, wiping her tear stained cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; She asked, her face beaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then, let&#39;s go get my wedding dress now, and the invitations, there&#39;s no time to prepare...&#34; she blabbered about, but I had stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look...&#34; I began, and I could see the confused look on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be a father to the child. I will take responsibility, but it does not mean that we are getting married.&#34; I said, and her face fell in despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She asked, seemingly not comprehending me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will not marry you.&#34; I stated bluntly, and her face fell, her eyes getting moist. It was something I was used to. Mabel had always been the type to cry about everything, and now was not an exception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you not want our child to have a complete family?&#34; she asked, tears threatening to escape her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will have a complete family. Just not the one where his parents are married I said, feeling apologetic, and she kept mute, digesting the information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I will leave now.&#34; I said, and she stared at me in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising to my feet, the screeching sound of the chair reverberated throughout the room, catching the attention of people who had been seated in other tables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out, I ignored the stares that had been directed at me, thanks to Mabel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hailing a taxi, I got in the back seat, gazing outside the window as my thoughts wandered. Was the child really mine? I thought as I stared out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For what seemed like a hour, i was lost in thought. The taxi soon came to a stop in front of my apartment, and I got out, paying the driver. I stood to the the side, watching the car zoom off, and I sighed deeply before heading inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked through the narrow hallway, my footsteps echoing until it came to a halt in front of my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who knew if Isabel was asleep. Gazing at the door that rested opposite mine, I had decided not to disturb her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally pushing my room door open, I walked in, letting myself fall onto my bed as I stared up at the ceiling. Was that the reason she had come here in the morning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To tell me she was pregnant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from the bed abruptly, I pealed off my clothes, heading to the bathroom where I had taken a bath. I let the water pour for what seemed like hours until I had finally turned the shower off, stepping out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got dressed in some loose shirt and pants, walking out to look for Isabel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knocking on the door of the opposite room, there was no response, and my brows furrowed. Had she fallen asleep so deep? I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning the handle slowly, I pushed the door open, my eyes squinting as I waited for her to scold me, but it never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking in, I turned on the lights and my eyes scanned the room, landing onto the bed that had been made neatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isabel?&#34; I called out, walking deeper into the room, wondering where she had gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking towards the bathroom door, I pushed it open only to find it empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where had she gone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking hurriedly out of the room, I went to get my phone intending to call her until I was hit by the sudden realization that she did not have a phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sh*t&#34; I cursed, fisting my hair as I held the phone, staring at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dialling a number, it was picked up on the third ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; I said, and I proceeded to report the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait until forty-eight hours before reporting her missing.&#34; The feminine voice said, and I bit my cheeks, what was I supposed to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calling someone else, I put the phone to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has gone missing.&#34; I said once the call got connected, and silence prevailed on the other end until it broke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find her!&#34;</p>
