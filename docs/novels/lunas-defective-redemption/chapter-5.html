                <p>chapter FIVE - KLINN</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabelle&#39;s pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up, I was surrounded by several monitors, and my wrist was attached to a drip. A forceful involuntary gasp escaped my lips as I felt life fill my lungs. Just as the realization of my being alive sank in, my hands instinctively went to my stomach. My eyes widened and a gasp escaped my lips as I remembered. I had jumped in front of a bus and gotten hit. I was pretty sure I&#39;d be dead along with my child but that was clearly not the case right now. I had been rescued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This shouldn&#39;t have happened. The pain of losing my baby along with being rejected hit me at once which made me livid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; I shake my head a little more vigorously before forcefully pulling the drip from my wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sat up on the bed, the door opened revealing a round-faced woman in a nurse&#39;s suit. She flashed me a warm smile and walked towards me, &#34;You&#39;re awake,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored her and stood on my feet, my eyes searching around the room for any sharp object.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found a razor on the table and without hesitation, I grabbed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am what are you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to slash myself on the wrist when she grabbed my elbow and lightly tipped the razor off my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was surprised as to how this human could keep up with my speed. I was a werewolf, I was stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing!&#34; I yelled, my voice hoarse from how dry my throat was. My wolf was sleeping inside of me. She&#39;d accepted my decision to take us and the baby to heaven, to the great moon goddess so it made sense I was weaker than normal, along with the anesthesia in my system.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, please rest. Don&#39;t do anything that would hurt your health even further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, I wrapped my arms around the nurse&#39;s neck and she gasped in surprise as she dropped the blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get in my way,&#34; I warned. &#34;I&#39;m only doing what&#39;s supposed to be done,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of my eyes, I saw another nurse appear by the door but she gasped and took off when she saw me. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t have saved me.&#34; I spat out bitterly while the nurse in my grip gasped for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let my grip around her neck linger for a while before I let her go. She fell to her knees and broke into a fit of coughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her a final glance and picked up the blade from the floor. By a few cuts of this, I&#39;ll be able to end it all. The incessant suffering of longing for a love that was loyal and pure, the mother wound of ending my growing child&#39;s life. I exploded into tears. I was horrible. No wonder my life was this shitty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I lifted my left hand to cut myself, I felt a sudden shift in the room and the next thing I knew, I was being enveloped in a warm hug. The blade I was holding tugged past his shirt and the faint scent of blood hit me but the scent of his body that reminded me of the luxurious tusk in the woods was clearer. I remembered the scent. But the current situation I found myself in with him didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to push him away but he held me closer, causing the blade in my hand to dig deeper into the skin underneath his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body instinctively started to calm under his touch and the longer we stood there, the more I felt like I was being renewed from the inside out. I swiftly felt his wolf&#39;s presence and this stirred my wolf awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Klinn,&#34; my wolf whispered to me, &#34;That&#39;s our mate&#39;s name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart ached at the sound of the name and I loosened my grip on the blade and let it fall between us to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad you survived,&#34; His voice was like velvet, melting all my pain away and igniting a feeling in me that I didn&#39;t know existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Klin,&#34; I whispered as I just let him hold me in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing me, he pulled away from the hug and looked at me. I swallowed, feeling sparks explode in my body as his icy blue eyes pierced into my soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you know my name?&#34; He asked, his soft plump lips parted in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without knowing anything about him except for his name, I found myself falling in love with simple details like this about him. His expression the details in his light blue eyes that were icy when he seemed to be looking at me with such intensity. It was like his wolf was calling out to my soul, and soothing me that everything would be alright when he looked at me like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Klinn,&#34; I found myself whispering again, my senses wrapped around the feeling of connection our mate bond gave me. I didn&#39;t know if it was just me, but</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned in and captured his lips into a kiss. Sparks flew and my stomach fluttered with butterflies. I closed my eyes and deepened the kiss, my hands instinctively wrapped on both sides of his neck softly, so intimately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, it felt like it was just us two until I heard a clearing of the throat which snapped me back to reality. I broke away from the kiss and removed my hands from the sides of his neck and shyly looked up to his intimidating but daring icy eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gently took a step back and turned to look at the nurses who had been watching us all along with a tinge of jealousy and embarrassment, I could tell by their increasing heart rates. But I was less bothered by their chalance behavior. What mattered to me was that my mate had found me. I must&#39;ve been too emotional when we first met which was why I wrongly concluded that he was human. Perhaps he&#39;d just needed time to adjust to meeting me.</p>
