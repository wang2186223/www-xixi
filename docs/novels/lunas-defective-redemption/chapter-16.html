                <p>If someone else had said that, the beast inside of me could have been released immediately but this time the case was different and I didn&#39;t even know why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so drunk but even with the rubbish that she was spitting out from her mouth, she still looked cute.</p>

                <p>A slight sigh escaped from my lips as my head broke into a nod.</p>

                <p>I was only seeing things that were never there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing another deep breath, I placed my hands on the steering and drove gradually back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we finally got to my place, I let out a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are here now,&#34; I announced to the person who was sitting behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was no response. I admitted that I totally forgot that she was drunk at first but the sound that I heard behind me was somehow strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More like a snore.&#34; The sound re-echoed in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around slowly, I noticed that she was snoring hard this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit!&#34; I exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drew off from the car and walked gradually towards her. Pulling her away from the car, she staggered a little and made her way to my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see tears in her eyes and I knew that it was from the excessive drinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t push me away. Don&#39;t reject me.&#34; She pleaded right from the depths of her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are drunk aren&#39;t you?&#34; I replied to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held her hands tightly and pulled her away. We still had a long way to go before we got to the guest room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head was directly on my chest and I could feel a really strange sensation from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could not understand it since all of this was a new development. But I could explain the fact that my heart was pounding hard against her head as though it was going to burst through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rate of my heart beating rose steeply by the minute until I was forced to pull her head away from it when I could no longer stand It and I was already gasping for breath like someone was in a race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Successfully, I dragged her away to the guest room and I placed her on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sweaty so I had to whip the sweat off from her face that was as smooth as silk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to affirm that she was really beautiful and I could not take my face away from her for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Snap out of it, Klinn.&#34; My subconsciousness yelled out from the inside of me and I pulled my eyes away from her swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening to me?&#34; I thought in my head as I walked away slowly to the main room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fell face up on the bed with my heart beating hard against my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole atmosphere of the house seemed to have changed already due to the aura that was emitting from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After today, I didn&#39;t learn much but I was such that after I meet with the therapist tomorrow, I would certainly be able to fit bits and pieces together and get a hint about what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, my head firmly on my pillow but it was really difficult for me to fall asleep as I kept rolling on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up the next morning aching all over.   I didn&#39;t realize when I even fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rose from the bed swiftly and got into something suitable. I had to go and see her as soon as possible and see if she had a good night&#39;s rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I walked towards the room, I noticed that it was already open from afar and my eyes were widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could it be that she was already awake?&#34; I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drew closer to the room and I noticed that something really strange was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sniffing her body as though her life depended on it, getting me confused as to what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to walk in there and inquire if she was looking for something since I already knew that she was a werewolf but my instincts drew me back from doing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just wait a  moment.&#34; I felt myself saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood on the spot waiting for what was gonna happen next. She continued sniffing and after a while, she paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face first flushed with so much anger and after a while, it flushed into grief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at her closely and I noticed that strands of tears were already escaping from her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could also feel the sad sensation which was strange. As though I was sharing in her pains even though I knew absolutely nothing about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe it&#39;s just because I am already way too attached to her?&#34; I thought again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no need for me to keep standing at the spot since I had already seen what I wanted to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drew over to her and for a moment, she didn&#39;t even know that there was someone in the room until I came close enough to touch her on her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head pushed upwards and our eyes locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I inquired that the words seemed to stir up all the emotions that were buried deep down inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was suddenly flushed with so much anger and grief that I was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long are you going to keep torturing me? What have I done to deserve it from you?&#34; She Inquired but I was really confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I offend you?&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still deny it? I thought that you were different from the former one but thinking about it closely. I think that all of you are the same.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, I was really confused staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really for real right now?&#34;  I muttered.</p>
