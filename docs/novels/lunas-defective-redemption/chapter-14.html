                <p>My eyebrows furrowed as I stared right into his eyes waiting for him to spit out the words in his mouth but he didn&#39;t seem to be ready to do that either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to give me a response or just keep on mopping at me?&#34; I shot at him and at least, the words brought him back to his senses.</p>

                <p>&#34;If you wouldn&#39;t mind, it would be great if you pulled that jaw of yours together,&#34; I announced, walking towards the freezer and getting a bottle of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sensed him shutting his lips immediately but I knew already that he was far from done with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But sir. Why the sudden change? I have known you for a long time now and you have never been like this, work comes first before anything or anyone else.&#34; He explained to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it because of that lady at the hospital?&#34; He spat and I paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I was frozen right on the spot where I stood and I clutched my hands tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you?&#34; I quietly said to him, but I was far from calm. Advancing swiftly towards him, I held him tightly on his shirt and noticed the shock in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing what I was doing, I quickly let go of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never you say that again,&#34; I growled at him, letting him go, I walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking away from the living room,  I walked up my luxurious stairs into my room with a long face and fell face up on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, I stared at the ceiling as a slight sigh escaped from my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening to me?&#34; I asked myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he was ready to say that after all. Sometimes it felt as though I was running crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And this was the night that I was going to get all the answers that I needed from her.&#34; I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slept off right on the spot that I laid but luckily for me,  I already had the alarm set in case of anything such as this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately the alarm rang, I jerked off from the bed with a worried look hanging on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone was at the other edge of the bed and I picked it up as soon as I could...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God! I have just fifteen minutes to be at the venue.&#34; I panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so tired that I slept off and I had to say that I needed some of that rest until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet swayed away from the bed and I placed them on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked over to the shower, pouring the cold water all over my body and checking the time almost every single minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting off from the bathroom, I  got dressed as soon as I could. I could hear the wall clock ticking at the other end of the room and I turned around towards it swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luckily, I am not a lady.&#34; I chuckled seeing that I still had five more minutes, and to my relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put the finishing touches and I got into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I headed straight to her home, the place I dropped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just with the thoughts of driving there, there was something strange about the way I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like a strange pulling that did want me to drop and it was as though driving was no longer of my own will even though I tried as much as I could to control it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got to the doorstep of her house, I noticed that the door was closed and she wasn&#39;t anywhere close either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where could she have gone to?&#34; I thought again as I continued to search around to see if I was going to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Negative thoughts sprang up in my head almost immediately. &#34;What if she had run away?&#34; I thought but I pushed the thoughts away from my head almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was certainly no way that she could have run away. She didn&#39;t seem like someone that could do such a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a part of me still held firmly to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when I was frustrated and I wanted to go away, I heard footsteps from behind me and I turned only for my eyes to meet with the most stunning lady that I had seen all my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore a milk-flowered gown and held her shoes in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she run from somewhere or someone?&#34; I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned my gaze to her face and I could see that she felt a little bit embarrassed that I was checking her out, but I didn&#39;t mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look beautiful.&#34; I complimented her, and her lips broke into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did not have to go through the extreme to compliment me. I know that I am not.&#34; She replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the words, I made a face at her until she was forced to pull her face away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well. I guess that you are right.  I did underrate your cause for the rare gem that you are, the words are supposed to be stunning.&#34; I corrected it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled &#34;You don&#39;t look bad yourself.&#34; She replied to me, as it was obvious she was trying as hard as she could to end the conversation and I decided to help her do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I motioned for the car, and she got into it and I rode to a restaurant. The ride was another silent one and when we finally got to the restaurant, she was in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looks beautiful.&#34; I heard her saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I am really glad that you like it,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a ticketed restaurant and I already reserved seats for us. Leading her over to the place, she placed some orders but ended up staring at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to say something but it turned out that she made the first move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is something that you wanted to inform me about right?&#34; There was so much anticipation in her eyes.</p>
