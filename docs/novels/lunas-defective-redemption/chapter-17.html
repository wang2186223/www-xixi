                <p>&#34;Are you really for real right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His deep masculine voice pierced through my ears like sweet music, but this time, it brought pain to my heart. I stared at his expression, feeling a pang in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he acting like he knew nothing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this his way of rejecting me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buckets of tears in which I had tried so hard to mask raced down my cheeks, falling onto the cold marble floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really not acknowledge me, Kinn?&#34; I asked, my voice beginning to choke as I stared at him, pain shone in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was quiet, he looked confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled painfully, wiping the tears that had stained my cheeks with the long sleeve of the shirt in which I was wearing. Must be his, I thought as I could smell his scent on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kinn confused, Masking emotions.&#34; I heard my wolf say in the back of my mind, but it did not matter. I was done getting hurt, I was tired of the rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me you want me out of your life, Kinn...reject me to my face.&#34; I demanded, the pain evident in my voice which had turn into whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood to his feet, fisting his hands into his thin strands of dirty blonde hair. I didn&#39;t know what it is he felt, but I had given up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly standing to my feet, my gaze rested onto his back which was turned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine!&#34; I said, giving up completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;&#34;I I Isabelle Anderson, rejects you Klinn Ethan Adams as my mate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said with a stung of pain in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like crumbling down after the words of rejection left my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was nice knowing you Klinn&#34; I whispered to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling painfully, I took slow and steady steps towards the door, pulling it open and walking out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alighting the stares, I was met with the P.A, David whom had been dressed in a black suit, a white shirt that had been tucked under the black pants of the suit, and a red tie that hung from his neck. He stared at me, confusion edged on his brows at my state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am?&#34; I heard him call out through my muddled mind, but I had ignored him. I did not have the strength to talk to anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of the gate which was not hard to unlock, I walked aimlessly in the streets of the city, my feet grazing pass the cobblestones. The chattering sound of the bustling city, the sound of cars honking and the feet of people thumping the ground faintly pierced through my ears, but all I had noticed was how shattered my heart was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The aroma of freshly baked bread wafted in the air, hitting my nostrils, and it made me realize I was hungry. I had not gotten a job, and I had no money. Everything needed an exchange, this was something I understood since I came to the human realm. Clutching onto my empty stomach, my gaze subconsciously shifted to the shop at the side. My mouth watered as I sighted the many pastries that had been put out in a show glass to advertise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hungry.&#34; I heard my wolf say in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t need to tell me that.&#34; I replied, rolling my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go and get us some food.&#34; It ordered and I snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you perhaps have money? Or do you want to spend your time in the human dungeon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it went silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Continuing to walk, I had reached a cafe. Staring at the sign board, I took a deep breath before pushing the glass door open, walking in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All heads turned to me, and I lowered my head as I walked towards the counter. I wasn&#39;t so weak, and I had never cowered under anyone&#39;s gaze except for Vivon, but I wasn&#39;t in my territory anymore, this was the human realm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could I speak with the owner?&#34; My hoarse voice came out, my eyes resting onto the human who stood behind the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw her brown eyes scan me for a fleeting second before it went back to the task she had been doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was wondering if I could see the owner?&#34; I asked, my voice laced with frustration as my eyes held a plea, but she had not even looked my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Came her curt reply, not glancing at me for even a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lips, feeling the strong taste of iron fill my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please. I actually saw the sign that had been hung up outside the shop. it says it&#39;s hiring?&#34; I said, my eyes darting around as I clutched the hem of the shirt in which I was wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss...&#34; She tried to say, but had been interrupted by a masculine voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the issue here?&#34; I heard the man say as I whipped my head to the side, my eyes resting onto a chubby old man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes swept over the lady across the counter, and then to me, finally resting onto my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw the shop was hiring, and I was thinking if the offer was still open.&#34; I said hesitantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Contrary to what I had expected, he smiled warmly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is very much open, dear. Come with me.&#34; He said, leading me to the office which was located at the back of the shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We soon reached in front of a door in which he pushed open, leading me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is your name, child?&#34; His asked, his calm gaze resting onto me as he sat on the chair behind his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isabelle.&#34;  I said, not finding and ounce of danger radiate from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m assuming you can make coffee?&#34; He asked, and I nodded. Of course, I thought. I occasionally would run an errand for the men at the club I used to work in, so I did learn to make coffee. Thinking about the club, my thoughts wandered to how Vivon might be doing, or Kinn. The moon goddess sure had a way of torturing me...for sins I do not remember committing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can take the job then.&#34; I heard the old man say, cutting through my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hungry.&#34; My wolf reminded me again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up right now.&#34; I ordered through the mind link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should get some food before resuming.&#34; the man said, bringing me back to reality, and I smiled thankfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Another good person.&#34; I heard my wolf say after seconds of being silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, I agreed...he was another good person I had met since my stay in the human realm, aside from Klinn.</p>
