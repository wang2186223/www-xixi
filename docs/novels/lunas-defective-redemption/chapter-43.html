                <p>After breakfast I had retired to my room, trying to contact my wolf whom had not responded to me. I paced back and forth, feeling restless until I finally settled on the bed, drifting off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I had woke up, it was evening, and the sun had began to hide beneath the clouds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stretched my body, yawning as I covered my mouth with my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting out of the bed, I walked downstairs where Klinn had just walked in, his gaze landing onto me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back.&#34; I said, walking towards him. I had wrapped my arms around his waist, hugging him. I had not known why I did it, but I felt the sudden urge to hug him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling away, my gaze traveled to look at him where he remained expressionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ain&#39;t you a loving girlfriend, Greeting me with hugs and kisses when I&#39;m back from work&#34; He finally said, a smirk coming to rest on his lips, and my eyes went wide. When had I kissed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did I kiss you?!&#34; I demanded, feeling my cheeks grow hot and he chuckled. What exactly happened to him, I thought in my head. Since when did he start to laugh or chuckle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the astonishment, I felt my heart  turn warm from watching his smile, and I noticed the dimple that had appeared on his cheek. Why hadn&#39;t I noticed that before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my head to get rid of the thoughts, Klinn had planted a kiss on my forehead, catching me off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you.&#34; He said, and I felt my heart stop. Since when was he so cheesy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps he had drank a little of cheese before coming home?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you go out for dinner?&#34; I asked, and he stared at me before shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; He asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; I responded, walking beside him as he climbed the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was thinking if I could inform my friend where I am?&#34; I said, and Klinn had not halted. Instead, he continued to walk, coming to a stop in front of his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean the one you had been staying with?&#34; He asked, and I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm.&#34; I hummed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How exactly do you plan on contacting him?.&#34; Klinn asked, and I fiddled with the hem of my dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was thinking if I could visit him.&#34; I said, patiently waiting for Klinn&#39;s answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; He finally said, and I beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll just go and change.&#34; He said, and nodded my head vigorously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he had changed, we both headed out to the place in which he had picked me up yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole ride was quiet as he focused on driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we reached, I stepped out of the car, heading for Alex&#39;s apartment in which I rang the doorbell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was soon pulled open and I came face to face with Alex who stared at me in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wicked being!&#34; He yelled, and I felt my ears begin to go numb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you run off to?!&#34; He asked, pulling me by the arm, his eyes scanning my face to check if I was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh...slow down.&#34; I said, and he glared at me before his eyes moved to rest on Klinn who stood beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Klinn, my boyfriend.&#34; I said, and I watched his jaw drop. He was probably wondering how I got a boyfriend so fast, but it was something he will never be able to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to meet you.&#34; Klinn said, and Alex nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that you have seen each other, we should go.&#34; Klinn said, and I turned to stare wide eyed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I at least have your number?&#34; Alex  said, and I turned to stare sheepishly at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not have a phone.&#34; I said, and his jaw dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One human you are, Belle.&#34; Alex said, and I felt the cold air that had began to cone from Klinn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you write your number down and hand it over to me?&#34; I offered, and Alex nodded, retiring into the apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He handed me the piece of paper when he got back, and I bid him goodbye, entering the car where Klinn had drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34; I asked, and Klinn had not said a word. Was he mad? I thought as I stole glances at him. Why was he mad though?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We rode into the night, neither of us saying a word, and I stared out of the window, wondering what must have upset him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey.&#34; I mind linked my wolf, knowing that it would not reply, but it had surprised me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; it asked, it&#39;s voice sounding irritated and I rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have not been speaking lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have nothing to say.&#34; it responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mate jealous.&#34; it said, and my eyes went wide as I turned to look at Klinn who&#39;s brows had knotted unconsciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All turned quite again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We soon came to a stop inside the mansion, Klinn walking ahead of me into the house where he vanished. Heaving a deep sigh, I headed to my room where I freshened up, changing into a pair of pajamas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, I went down for dinner where I had not found Klinn. I ate in silence as I stared at the door, hoping that he would come, but he never did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I headed to my room after I had finished eating, where I had sunk onto my bed, my eyes staring up at the ceiling, my imaginations went wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I soon drifted off to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another morning came, bringing it with new hopes and aspirations. My eyes fluttered open, and my thoughts traveled to last night when I had not seen Klinn since she got back. Getting off the bed, I proceeded to make it. Once I was done, I was about to head for the bathroom when I caught something from the corner of my eye. Turning, I stared intently at the screen that shimmered from the sunlight that hit it. There was a note that had been stuck to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking it uo, my eyes moved as I read through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I figured I had been a bad boyfriend by not considering your needs. I decided to get you a phone as my first boyfriend deed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, feeling my heart flutter at his cuteness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had never thought Klinn would have this side to him. A different side where he had the ability to be cheesy. What had changed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning the phone on, I found his number had been stored in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing it back on the side table, I proceeded to head to the bathroom where I freshened up.</p>
