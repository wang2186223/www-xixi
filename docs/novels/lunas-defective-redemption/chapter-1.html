                <p>chapter ONE - REJECTED</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brutally betrayed and rejected by her Alpha mate on her birthday, pregnant werewolf Isabelle Anderson flees to New York—only to lose her child in a suicide attempt. Rescued by Klinn Adams, a CEO hiding an eerie secret, she discovers he’s her second chance mate. But Klinn feels no emotions, his wolf silenced by a cruel defect. As their bond ignites sparks he can’t deny, deadly secrets emerge: her vengeful ex hunts her, rogue werewolves threaten their world, and a shadowy enemy stalks her in the human realm. Can a broken Luna heal an Alpha who doesn’t believe in love, before old sins destroy their last hope?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabelle&#39;s Pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Click!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of my heels against the tiled floor was like music to my ears as I reached the top of the stairs and slowly but happily made my way to me and my man&#39;s room, through the wide picturesque hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was a special day for me. He may have forgotten it was my birthday, because of the responsibilities that came with being an Alpha but It was okay, he had me. I will do everything I can to keep us together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when the sight of our room was right ahead of me, I felt an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. I halted in my steps and forced a smile to pull myself together. Then I proceeded to move forward but when the smell of tainted perfume and sweaty bodies hit my nose, my heart sprung to life and my wolf came to the surface, I was too tense to resist her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sped forward, pushing open our room door, and the sight that I saw next was heart-shattering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My Alpha, my man, and my only true love was dug in between a strange woman&#39;s legs, and he seemed to be enjoying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced behind him and when our eyes met, I saw the little ounce of malice cross his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My knees felt weak and my heart was breaking because I knew he didn&#39;t harbor a single feeling of regret for what he had done to me, to us!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivion, my love,&#34; my eyes blurred with tears as he separates from the woman, and she gave me a didactic stare as though I was the whore for stepping into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave us for a moment beautiful,&#34; he told the skinny blonde woman and she kissed him before putting on a robe and leaving me alone with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tears trickled down my cheeks as he looked at me with a persuasive smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What Is it this time?&#34; He stepped towards me in a bid to wipe my tears but I stood back. There was no way I was letting him touch me with the same hand that had cupped some woman&#39;s sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;V-Vivion, why did you do this to me, why are you doing this to us?&#34; I stared at the floor, at both our feets, I couldn&#39;t look him in the eyes, I just couldn&#39;t. It was too much for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isabelle, do you still need to ask me that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly built up some courage and looked up to face Vivion who looked completely fine by what he did. That didn&#39;t sit well with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivion,&#34; I wiped my tears angrily, &#34;I&#39;m your mate, how can you cheat on me like that and be completely fine with it?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be respectful, Isabelle. I&#39;m still your Alpha.&#34; He stood over me, his eyes unshaken and his stance rigid. I tore my gaze away from him, intimidated but still hurt. He walked past me and sighed, &#34;Don&#39;t act like the victim, Isabelle. You did this to us by being a club&#39;s whore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d heard those words so many times that they didn&#39;t sting anymore. &#34;Yes, I was a club dancer for months just so I could escape abuse and bring my aunt a safer life. But what does that have to do with us? The moment I found out we were mates, I stopped dancing publicly and became completely submissive to you my Alpha, my mate and as your Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when will you stop blaming me for my past that I can&#39;t control? Also, you&#39;ve cheated on me multiple times already, that&#39;s enough payback. Sometimes I feel like you&#39;re just doing this to me for your own selfish reasons then you blame me for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Insolence!&#34; He yelled, and my wolf bowed her head in submission at his Alpha tone. I might be his mate, but he is first an Alpha. &#34;Isabelle, you&#39;ve reproached me time and time again. I won&#39;t take that from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few moments of silence, he murmured, &#34;I can&#39;t do this anymore, I&#39;m ending this with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tear rolled down my cheek and my voice shook, &#34;O-on my birthday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to face me, his face clear with distinction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I, Alpha Vivion Mark of Avid Mars -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;-Please don&#39;t do it!&#34; I found myself yelling, but my words went by untended to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...I hereby reject Isabelle Anderson as my mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped back, feeling my stomach sink as his rejection set in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I&#34; my voice shook but I forced myself to stand tall in front of him. &#34;I, Isabelle Anderson, accept your rejection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the brief look of hurt in Vivion&#39;s eyes but it was useless to me now. He was so bent on hurting me and he knew just the best ways to destroy me. His rejection being one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the biggest lies I told in the world probably had to do with me saying I accepted Vivion&#39;s rejection but here I was on a train leading to a popular city in the human world where I could fall apart In secret without anyone wondering if there was something wrong with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I arrived at a city called New York, I was in awe of how many people were walking around and how there were so many advanced machines in perfect coordination with the road. I couldn&#39;t help but be impressed. The technologies in the human territory were way more advanced than the technologies back in Avid Mars .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart pounded harder in my chest as I was reminded of Vivion. I held back my tears and stepped into the crowd, mixing in with them effortlessly. Surprisingly, my hurricane mind calmed a little bit being around the humans because I could hear their heart pace and tell if they were good people or not. Most of them were just worried about their lives. Anyway, it put me in a more comfortable space to know that I was stronger than all of them and they didn&#39;t pose a danger to me at all.</p>
