                <p>Vivion&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it was her birthday, as a matter of fact, I knew days before but I felt she deserved nothing from me. It might have been a long time, but the pain of knowing she was once a whore and danced for men still lingered in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was meant to be mine, mine alone!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had looked forward to the day I see her, longed for the comfort of her touch, knowing she would be mine. But not even the moon goddess could explain my feelings when I found out she enticed other men, impure, touched by someone else, someone I didn&#39;t even know so I could bask in the joy of strangling him with my bare hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All my life, I thought my mate would be mine, as my father took everything I ever wanted. Growing up with the cruelness of never having something you call yours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;He wouldn&#39;t take my mate&#39; I could bet on that. But no, she was already taken by someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thoughts of it makes me sink my claws into my own flesh, she disgust me most times. I should hate her, but I can&#39;t, she&#39;s my mate. I try to rough handle her under the sheets, she deserves it but it hurts me too, so I stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what better way to make her feel the pain I feel than lay with another, waiting to get caught?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I, of course heard her footsteps, smelt her perfume and that sweet scent a mate should have, her heels hitting against the floor while her heart beating faster as she neared the door. I must confess, I did feel guilty when she walked in through that door and called my name, seeing the pain in her eyes made it feel worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Easily sliding out of the woman underneath me and watch her proudly exit the room, I walked up to my mate who couldn&#39;t even look me in the eye!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried wiping her tears for it was painful to look at but she immediately stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was what I wanted I believe, to see pain across her face but she suddenly got the boldness to talk back at me instead of crying and begging me to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned slowly, uttering the words of rejection, this I believed would hurt her more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my satisfaction was short lived when she accepted my rejection so easily, I was shocked and pain. Was I perhaps wrong to think she would fall on her knees and beg me to reverse it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My doubts were clear when I watched her turn around and slammed the door behind her. By the next morning, she was gone! What have I done?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no, I am an Alpha and will never submit to anyone, and definitely not a woman, she brought this upon herself by sleeping with those idiots, knowing fully well she would one day belong to someone and of all persons, me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been a month now since she left, maybe I went too far, I shouldn&#39;t have rejected her that way, maybe I shouldn&#39;t have let her leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clamor on my thoughts as I lay in bed, I should leave here, go somewhere where there&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit up and walk into the shower and in no time I step out, I get dressed and head to my garage where my cars are parked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where would you like to go sir?&#34; asked my driver as he bowed in my presence</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hand me the keys, I will be driving myself&#34; I said to him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But sir&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keys now!&#34;  I said, loosing my patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched him as he fumbled with the keys out of his pocket before gently handling them to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed it from his hand and proceeded to the driver&#39;s seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly I hear footsteps and it didn&#39;t take long for me to realize who they belonged to, my guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, we&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will be going alone today&#34; I nonchalantly said as I closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My Beta, John, knocked on the glass widow. I sighed and lowered the glass down</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, please let us follow you wherever you are heading.&#34; he said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to say I can&#39;t protect myself in time of need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No sir, that&#39;s not what I meant, I only mea&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am your Alpha John, you should be scared at what I can do, not what can happen to me. Move out of my way, or I run you all over&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies sir&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said and quickly moved aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled up the widow and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drive into the road with no thoughts or plans of where I want to go, but I knew I definitely needed to leave that house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabelle, I never knew what she actually meant in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drive by a popular spot of mine, and I waste no time in turning the car around recklessly and parked in front of the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I alight the vehicle and toss the keys to a valet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening sir, how would you like&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started, but I didn&#39;t wait for him to finish as I walked past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk into the bar and stare at the surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move towards the bar and take a seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening sir, what would you like to be served?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asked the bartender</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just give me the usual, make it stronger, I seem to be getting sober quicker than expected&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course sir&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hand me the keys&#34; I said to him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched him step in and out of a room and handed me a customized looking key, the keys to my VIP guest room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring the drinks to my room and see if you can add a dessert to it, she must be good looking to get me in the mood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around and walked into the elevator and take myself to the last floor, getting to the door and only room on this floor, I place the key into it&#39;s hole and twist the knob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have never felt so miserable as I do feel right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I toss the key to the left and toss my jacket to the right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take out my phone and dial my closest friend&#39;s line, Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivion, how are you doing? You actually called, what&#39;s the occasion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear his sarcastic voice over the phone, never has he been serious in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not back Richie, it&#39;s been 4 weeks&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who!?&#34;</p>

                <p>I throw myself on the bed and hold my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, ex mate you mean&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dont make things more complicated, I called cause I am currently a mess and drinks do nothing anymore, I fuck a lady and all I  see is her face, I was told I call her name in my sleep, I am losing my mind man!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you regret it!? You rejected her Vivion, and you knew she had your baby!&#34; I heard him say.</p>
