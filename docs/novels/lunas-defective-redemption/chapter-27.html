                <p>I had retired to my room, my heart heavy as I sunk onto the bed. I stared at the ceiling, my thoughts wandering. Vivon had not cared to help. Had he cut ties with us only because of that woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my hands tightly into a fist as my eyes shone anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had left, but it she could always go back to Avid mars, I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up abruptly, I had visited the human realm again, but this time, I had a direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking across the pavement, I had caught sight of the blonde woman holding a tray from the glass doors of the cafe. My blood boiled the more I had stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon it was nighttime, I had stood in the shadows, my eyes watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the keys clank as she locked the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed her, and by this time I had morphed into my wolf, leaping from tree to tree as she walked to where I did not know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crouched down on a tree when she stopped, her eyes scanning the area before finally raising her head to look up as she stared at the starry night sky. My eyes subconsciously followed her, and I stared at the full moon that sat Lazily in the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking another path, I had went into the woods, staring at her from behind the dark forest as she fiddled with the keys in her hand, trying to unlock the house. did she live here? I thought as I continued to stare at her. it was far from the main city where there were lots of buildings and malls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared curiously as her hand had stopped moving, spinning her head to stare at something. And then she continued to fiddled with the keys, hurting my ear drums, and I let out a low growl. She had caught it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit! I cursed out in my head when she whipped her head to stare at me from behind the bush I had been hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly stepping backwards, I went deeper into the woods, watching as she approached where I had been standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around, running as fast as I could, my paws denting the soil, leaping onto the trees as I tried to get away from her sight.  I could not let her see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had lept onto a tree, sitting on it as I rested. I watched as she approached the prints in which my paws had made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My amber eyes followed her as she crouched down, observing the prints before finally rising to her feet, heaving a deep sigh and walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jumping down from the tree, my wolf watched the direction in which she had come from, before finally morphing into human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked hurriedly through the hallway, my clothes askew and stained with mud, avoiding getting caught by anyone. I had went for a little hunt after my encounter with Vivon&#39;s mate, stealing my prey&#39;s clothes as I had ripped mine while morphing. It smelled of fish, but I had no choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heaved a sigh of relief as I reached the door to my chamber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stretching out my hand to push it open, I halted, blood draining from my face at a voice behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And where might you be coming from, young lady?&#34; I heard the voice ask, and I turned around to meet a pair of emerald green eyes. Magnus, I thought as I placed my hand on my chest, letting out the breath in which I had been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared up at him where his lips had curled up amusingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the door open, I dragged him in, closing the door behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to stare at him after making sure to lock the door, I was met with his piercing gaze staring questioningly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was at loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you not speaking?&#34; Magnus asked, his eyes resting onto my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had been friends since childhood and he had been there on my coming of age ceremony. He had also went to fight off the rogues years ago when mom had lost her life in the battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had went hunting.&#34; I said, not looking at him as I lazily walked to the white couch, sinking myself onto it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah...I see. Hunting you say?&#34; He asked, making his way to where I sat, his eyes staring accusingly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I said, not paying attention to his look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why are you sweating so much?&#34; He asked, using a finger to swipe my forehead, leaving a smudge of sweat and mud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slapping his hand away, I rose to my feet, heading to the bathroom where I had sunk myself into a warm bath, closing my eyes to get my emotions together. Vivon had left me for that blonde woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had not seen her clearly until today, and I had to admit that she was indeed beautiful... it only made my blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid in the tub for what seemed like hours before wrapping myself up in a bathrobe and retiring to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had barely made two steps before my eyes caught Magnus who had sat leisurely on the couch, playing with my car keys in which he had seen on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you not leaving yet?&#34; I asked, my voice laced with irritation, he was disturbing my privacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some friend you are, Vera.&#34; He chuckled wearily, his eyes moving to look at me. And by this time I had pulled out the hair dryer from my closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem to only remember our friendship only when you need a favor.&#34; His voice came again, and I rolled my eyes as I dried my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not that I mind though.&#34; he added, standing to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really okay, Vera?&#34; his voice came and I turned to look at him before nodding my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he turned around, leaving and closing the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the closed door, unfathomable emotions flickering in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was it I felt?</p>
