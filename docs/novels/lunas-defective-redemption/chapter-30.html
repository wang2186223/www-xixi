                <p>I stared at the restaurant in which he had brought me, then back at the man who stood by my side. I am sure he had heard my stomach rumble earlier, I feel so embarrassed now. But why decide to treat me to breakfast in one of the most reputable restaurants in Pelham Bay?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring up at the sign, it read &#34;Orrico&#39;s Italian Restaurant&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed as I turned to look at him, questions swirling in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you not hungry?&#34; he asked, his brow raising questioningly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really, I&#39;m pretty okay.&#34; I lied, my head held high in pride. Of course I didn&#39;t want to accept anything from him, I didn&#39;t know him at all. What if he had gotten back to fulfill his girlfriend&#39;s wish of poisoning me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shuddered at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though my firm resolve wavered as my stomach grumbled loudly, betraying my previous words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lips as my hazel eyes traveled to rest on his face that had curled up into an amused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the door open, I followed behind him, playing nervously with the hem of the shirt in which I had been wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes occasionally darted to the not so many people that occupied some of the wooden tables that were arranged cozily in the restaurant. My eyes traveled to the paintings that had been hung up on the brick walls, feeling that they really looked nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halting as we reached one of the empty tables, he had already settled down, his eyes staring at me questioningly. I soon pulled out the wooden chair and sat, my still eyes scanning the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, ma&#39;am.&#34; A masculine voice pierced through my ears, and I turned to the direction of the voice only to see a man whom had been clad in a long sleeves buttoned down black shirt and black slacks. His hair had been neatly groomed, and it shone in the dimly lit restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would you like to have?&#34; the waiter asked, his question directed at the man sitting across the table. My eyes watched as he looked away from the black card in which he had been holding, and my gaze traveled to look at his side of the table in which the card had been resting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two plates of Spaghetti bolognese, two plates of Chicken Marsala, and a bottle of Barbera.&#34; I heard him say, speaking for both of us, and my eyes darted to stare at him. He probably had been here before, I thought as my eyes darted back and forth between the man and the waiter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is generous.&#34; I heard my wolf say and I rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Might you be mocking me, Belle?&#34; his voice pierced through my ears and my eyes moved, resting onto him, confusion swirling in them. He  thought I had rolled my eyes at him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t even know my name, I can bet on it.&#34; He said again, clicking his tongue and I bit my lips. He was right. I had heard his girlfriend call him by his name that day, but I could not remember it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Alex.&#34; his words came again, and I nodded. The silence on the table prevailed as neither of us had nothing to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The once talkative me had turned mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enjoy your meal.&#34; The waiter&#39;s voice was heard again, cutting into the silence that had enveloped us as he unloaded the food from the trolley in which he had been pushing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat unmoving, as I did not know how to react. I didn&#39;t even know him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat.&#34; His voice came and i looked up from the plate of food that sat on the table in front of me, I stared deep into his eyes as if to uncover his hidden intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t stoop so low as to poison you, I have other ways to kill you if I wanted to.&#34; He said, smiling amusingly as he stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other ways to kill me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up the fork and knife, I try to cut into the delicious looking chicken breast, along with the rice that bedded it, salivating before it even got to I mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been really hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed in satisfaction at how juicy it tasted, savoring it&#39;s taste as I chewed and suck on the food carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have never seen you in Pelham Bay.&#34; I heard Alex say, and my gaze traveled to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I only just moved to this city a couple of weeks ago.&#34; I said, trying to sound as real as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You clearly didn&#39;t come here with your family.&#34; He said again, and by this time I had stuffed my mouth with the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh...yes, I don&#39;t have a family.&#34; I said casually as I continued to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you perhaps runaway from home and don&#39;t want them to find you huh?&#34;  He asked again, and I stared at him wondering what had given him the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No&#34; Came my short reply and he didn&#39;t probe further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bending my head, I continued to eat. The clink and clank of my utensils reverberating throughout the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here.&#34; I heard him say again as he placed the wine filled glass near me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up the glass, I stared at the red liquid before bringing it to my mouth and taking a sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what seemed like an hour, we were finally done eating, and Alex paid for the meal, and we both headed out of the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I said as I came to a stop in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You definitely need to pay with more than a thank you.&#34; Alex said, shrugging his shoulders before running his fingers through his raven black hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll pay you when I receive my monthly pay then.&#34; I said rolling my eyes. But I heard him chuckle, and I stared up to look at him, wondering what funny thing I had said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you really pay me back a hundred dollar by the end of the month?&#34; He asked, his brows raising up cockily as he stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared up at him in a daze. Had a mere meal been so expensive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was twice my salary!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t make you pay with your salary.&#34; He said, chuckling when he seemed to have noticed my dazed expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say yes to being friends and you won&#39;t have to pay for the meal.&#34; He added as I stared at him, his gaze getting serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood staring at him as I thought of the possible outcomes of being friends with this guy in pink, Alex. His girlfriend would probably make a toast of me, but I don&#39;t think I care? I don&#39;t have a hundred dollar to pay him after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; I said defeated</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Friends?&#34; Alex asked, his eyes gauging me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just what does he plan to benefit from this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I said rolling my eyes.</p>
