                <p>&#34;Sir.&#34; A maid called out with a bow, and Klinn nodded, walking up the stairs as I followed behind him. It felt like an eternity since I have been here, and I could remember myself walking down this very stairs after rejecting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I soon came to a stop behind Klinn, and he shifted to the side, showing me the door that led to a room different from his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the door open, it creaked, and I walked in, my eyes scanning the room as he followed behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can stay here.&#34; He said, and my gaze moved to look at him before it went to rest in the feminine looking room again. Had he had this room all along? I asked myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps he has had a girlfriend in the past who used to own this room. I felt my stomach dip in jealousy at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I said, walking towards the dressing table that sat to a side of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go have them prepare a light dinner.&#34; Klinn said, and I heard his footsteps echo until it faded behind the door that creaked before clicking closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked towards the king sized bed, feeling it dip as I sat, my eyes continuing to scan the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat there, not knowing what to do, and I finally got tired, heading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam.&#34; A maid called out, bowing her head when I walked into what looked like the dining room where she had been preparing the table, and I paused. Madam?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything I could help with?&#34; I asked, trying to be polite, easing the awkwardness that had woven into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah...how can the madam possibly work?&#34; she asked, shaking her head to dismiss my offer, and my cheeks turned hot. I was certainly not used to being called &#34;Madam&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, and the maid took it for disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have I offended you ma?&#34; she asked, and my eyes went wide as they moved to stare at her as she pursed her lips. Her big brown eyes rested onto the floor, seemingly not able to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, no, no.&#34; I said, shaking my head frantically as to not let her think she had offended me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter.&#34; Klinn&#39;s voice came, and I turned to see him come to stand beside me, his piercing gaze landing onto the maid that stood,  her head hung low in despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing much.&#34; I shrugged, turning to look at her as she sweat bullets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the meal ready yet?&#34; Klinn asked, and she nodded, trying to be natural despite I could see her uneasiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No worries.&#34; I said to her, and she nodded, leaving the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I and Klinn stared at the door where she had faded, and I turned to look at Klinn when he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Already acting like a madam, are we?&#34; He asked, a mischievous smirk coming to rest on his lips. Something I had never witnessed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling my eyes, I proceeded to pull out a chair in which I sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of us said a word, and Klinn proceeded to pull out the chair at the head of the table, sitting on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the meal was served, and I dug in, eating without saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we were done eating, I headed back to my room where I took a bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I was done with the bath, I headed back to the bed where I was hit by the realization that I had no extra clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open just then, and I turned to see Klinn walk in, dressed in a new pair of clothes. His hair looked wet, and I figured he had also taken a bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; He asked as he met my worried look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no clothes to wear.&#34; I said, my eyes moving to the clothes I had been wearing earlier as it rested onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come with me.&#34; He said, and I walked behind him, feeling completely embarrassed. My eyes searching around wearily, I was dressed only in a bathrobe with nothing underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He soon led me to his room where he pulled out a pair of female pyjamas from his closet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, not saying a word as he handed the clothes to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I said, accepting them as I turned around, leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but still wonder if he once had a girlfriend or just happened to have female things lying around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I was done changing in my room, Iaid on the bed, my eyes resting onto the ceiling as my thoughts wandered to Alex. He must be panicking by now, I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing deeply, I had decided that I was going to contact him tomorrow. But as I thought about it, I figured I had no means of contacting him. How was I supposed to tell him I was okay, I asked myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a breath, I closed my eyes. I was going to figure out something by tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts wandered for a bit before I finally drifted off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning soon came, and my eyes fluttered open, welcoming the reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared up at the white ceiling, feeling lazy. But in the end, I had gotten out of the bed, my feet landing onto the cold marble floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading to the bathroom, I freshened up and changed into the clothes I had been wearing yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tying my hair up into a messy bun, I proceeded to head downstairs to the dining room. Once I reached, I met the room empty, and I scanned around, my eyes looking for Klinn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps he was not awake yet. Walking to the table, I pulled out a chair in which I sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the food was served, but Klinn was still nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir had left for work early today.&#34; One of the maids said as she placed the tea cup in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my mood dim upon hearing her words, and I ate alone in silence.</p>
