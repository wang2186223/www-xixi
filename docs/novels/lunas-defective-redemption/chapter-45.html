                <p>Isabelle&#39;s POV..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had just finished my breakfast, and I was contemplating on whether to call Klinn or not. He was probably at work by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, I picked up the phone from the bedside table, calling him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; His voice came after the third ring, and I felt my breath hitch from hearing his voice from the phone. Masculine, yet so charming. I felt my heart flutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only called to test it.  The phone, I mean. Plus, I got your note.&#34; I said with so much difficulty, and I waited for his reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; That&#39;s good then. And how do you like my attempts at being a good boyfriend?&#34; He asked, and I could imagine the smirk on his face as he said it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Silly.&#34; I stated, feeling my cheeks grow hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll pick you up for lunch later.&#34; He said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mhmm.&#34; came my hum of approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, I disconnected the call, clutching the phone tightly in my hand as I stared at it for another minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing the phone on the bedside table, I had worn a pair of slippers in which I had found in the room, heading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam.&#34; A maid called out, bowing her head as I alighted the stairs. I was still not used to being called madam, but I felt too weak to argue about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does madam need anything?&#34; She asked, and I stared intently at her as if to decipher whether I needed anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Came my short reply, and she nodded, walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking towards the kitchen, I had decided to brew a cup of coffee before lunch as I was bored and had nothing to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into the spacious kitchen, my eyes falling onto the brewing machine, and I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking towards it I had proceeded to brew a cup of latte for myself. Back then while I worked, I had also learned how to brew coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was done, I brought the cup to my nose the sweet aroma of caramel and chocolate wafting in the air and hitting my nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading back to the room, I proceeded to sip from the cup, reading a book in which I had found in the study room earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For what seemed like hours, I sat in my room until my phone beeped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking it up, a message had popped up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Klinn would come to pick me up in two hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting off the bed, I took a bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking over to the closet, I pulled it open to find no clothes in it. What was I supposed to wear? I thought to myself. I certainly could not wear the old clothes I had been wearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking out of the room, I pushed Klinn&#39;s room door open, walking in where I headed for his closet. Perhaps he had some female clothes I could wear. It made me wonder if he had a girlfriend before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling the wardrobe open, my jaw dropped at the sight. Half of the space had been stacked with female clothes of different colors. Rummaging through the wardrobe, I finally pulled out a black dress in which I had worn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tying my hair up into a messy bun, I proceeded to dab my lips with some lip tint in which I had always had, cladding myself in a pair of simple shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Klinn finally arrived, and I got into the car to find a lady sitting beside him on the other side. My gaze met hers, and she gave me a polite smile. Who was she? I thought to myself as I settled comfortably in the space beside Klinn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had only just glanced at me before continuing to do something on his phone. It made my spirit dim. Was she the lady who owned the female dresses in his wardrobe?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car soon started, and I stared out of the window, having nothing to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For what seemed like an hour, the car moved until it finally came to a stop in front of a restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all alighted the car, heading inside where we walked towards a table, Klinn pulling out a chair for me to sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katherine, this is Isabel. My girlfriend.&#34; Klinn&#39;s voice came after a minute of silence,and I turned to look at the woman who was called Katherine, a  bright smile plastered across her face as she stretched out her hand for a handshake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took it, feeling her grip on my hand, and I smiled slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to finally meet you, Isabel. I&#39;m Klinn&#39;s long lost friend.&#34; She said, the smile not leaving her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you manage to melt this ice?&#34; She asked after another minute of silence, her gaze resting onto Klinn, and I realized what she had meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blush came to rest on my face, and she smiled knowingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, now...let&#39;s all not talk about unimportant stuff.&#34; Klinn&#39;s voice cut through, sparing me from answering the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the waiter served the food, and we all ate, Katherine doing all the talking as I and Klinn listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And once, Klinn rejected a rich heir in everyone&#39;s presence during a banquet. You should have seen her face.&#34; Katherine said, stifling a laugh as her eyes moved to rest on Klinn who had an indifferent look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was years ago.&#34; Klinn stated lazily, and I turned to stare at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They must have known each other since childhood, I thought feeling the small tug of jealously at my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, yeah. It&#39;s been years since it happened.&#34; Katherine said as she chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once we finished eating, Katherine bid Klinn and I goodbye as she did not want to impose on us by driving in the car with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have my driver pick me up.&#34; She said  and Klinn nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was nice having lunch with you both.&#34; She added, a smile coming to settle on her face, and I returned it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting into the car, we drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting home, I hurried into the house, and Klinn followed behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t think I didn&#39;t notice it.&#34; Klinn said when he over took me, standing in front of me, his lips curling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Notice what?&#34; I asked, confusion marrying my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That you&#39;re jealous.&#34; He said, and I froze. Had he noticed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course I had been jealous of his closeness to Katherine, and how she had been with him since the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not know what you speak of.&#34; I denied, pushing him aside and walking up the stairs, but he had followed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should admit it.&#34; He said</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does your face look so red?&#34; he asked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Red like a tomato.&#34; He added, and I felt like stitching his mouth to stop him from talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had he become such a talkative?</p>
