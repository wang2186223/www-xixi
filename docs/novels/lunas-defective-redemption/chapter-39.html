                <p>Isabella&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had driven into the night, neither of us  saying a word as  the deafening silence prolonged. I stared out of the window, my thoughts wandering. As I  thought of the  incidents that had happened, it felt as though I was living in someone else&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts wandered to the night before in which someone had tried to hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran, my hair being carried by the wind. My throat burned and my head hurt, but I had not stopped running, I could  not stop. I could hear her closing in, and I proceeded to run faster, feeling the blood in my body rush up to my nose. Why was she after me? I thought as I had continued to run. I would have morphed into my wolf, but I guess it now understood that the human realm was not our territory, and thus, it had told me to run. Running into a corner, it had been a dead end. I stood staring at it, wondering what to do. I could hear her footsteps get closer. Crouching, I had bent with my hand on my chest, taking in all the air I could take in.  &#34;Oh, Princess Isabel met an end?&#34; I had heard her say behind me, and I turned to stare at the woman who had hid her face behind a black hoodie. How did she know my name? Was she perhaps someone in which Alex&#39;s girlfriend had sent to murder me? I still wondered</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I had asked, my throat burning as I stared at her closing in. &#34;That, my dear...you do not need to know. Let&#39;s just get this done and over with.&#34; She said, and I had seen the sinister smirk on her lips that were visible from under the hoodie.  Reaching me, she had slapped me across the face, sending me falling to the ground, and she smiled. I could feel the strong taste of metal in my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had strength, strong for a human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you letting a lowly human hit you!&#34; I heard my wolf scold me in my head, and I had guessed it knew the answer. When I came to the human realm, all I had wanted was to live a normal life like the humans. When I had rejected my second mate, I had made up my mind to forget that I was a werewolf. There was no place for us in the human realm, and I had decided to live like a human...I did not want to hurt anyone. &#34;Fight back or I&#39;ll do it for you.&#34; My wolf had threatened and I could perceive the anger in its voice at me being hit by a human.  &#34;No.&#34; I said firmly in my head, wiping off the blood that had tickled down the corner of my lips. And by this time, the woman had held a metal baseball bat in her hand. Was she going to hit me with that? I had thought as I watched her close the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shuddered at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Close your eyes, princess...I&#39;m going to make it real quick.&#34; She said as she played with the bat. And just when she had held it in the air, she halted, whipping her head to stare at behind her. Abruptly putting away the bat, she turned to stare at me one last time before running away.  I stared at the empty space in front of me in which the woman had been standing. I let out the breath in which I had been holding when my ears perked up involuntarily, receiving the sound of footsteps that sounded hurried.  My jaw dropped when Alex came into view. What was he doing here? Noticing me, he ran towards me. &#34;Are you okay?&#34; He had asked, patting my right cheek as soon as he got to me. &#34;Mhmm.&#34; I hummed in response as I nodded my head. But my consciousness had began to fade. I felt my vision blur as seconds passed, and I finally gave in, my vision turning black as I blanked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alex had taken me to his house that night and treated my wounds. . Just who was that woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had woken with the feel of  the sun on my face, and I could see red under my closed eyes. Tossing and turning on the bed, it seemed wider. The sheets brushing my skin did not feel like the faded ones I had back at my home.My gaze landed onto the hard white ceiling that did not look like the old ones back at where I stayed. It didn&#39;t take me long to know where I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alex  had walked in, his feet glazing the marble floor. &#34;You are awake.&#34; I heard him say, my eyes following him as he poured a glass of water. &#34;You had expected me to die, had you not?&#34; I asked as I recollected the incident from last night. My throat burned as I spoke, and Alex made his way towards the bed, handing me the glass of water in which he had poured. Taking it from him, I took a sip, easing my burning throat and I handed the empty glass to him. &#34;Wouldn&#39;t your girlfriend&#39;s wish be fulfilled if I die?&#34; I asked, my gaze landing onto Alex&#39;s back as he returned the cup. &#34;Indeed.&#34; He said as he chuckled. &#34;She would be really pleased to have you six feet under.&#34; He said as he turned around, staring at me as his lips curled up. I could tell something flickered in his eyes, but it had vanished as quickly as it came.  &#34;Take a hot bath and come out for breakfast.&#34; He had said, making his way to the door before halting and turning to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left without saying a goodbye or thank you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had driven for an hour or two, and we soon came to a stop inside Klinn&#39;s home. The home in which I had left days ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I alighted the  car, my eyes travelled to the fountain that had been lit up, and I felt my heart flutter at the serenity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked behind Klinn as he led me into the mansion, our footsteps echoing as we made our way into the spacious living room.</p>
