                <p>Mia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good news, family!&#34; Ethan exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is there a meeting?&#34; I asked, approaching the sitting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stood there glancing through all of their eyes, frozen in discomfort from the meeting, I couldn&#39;t help but think about how this vacation had been Ethan&#39;s idea all of a sudden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. He had been the one to suggest all of this, to plan it, and to excitedly share the details with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. But now, as I looked at Alexander&#39;s tear-stained face, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if Ethan had thought this through before unleashing the secret to the little boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he considered how Alexander would feel, being left behind and knowing he doesn&#39;t have a space in the vacation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he thought about the impact this would have on our already fragile family dynamics that Alexander already hugged?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or had he just been too caught up in his own excitement to think about anyone else-that means pure selfishness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a surge of frustration towards Ethan saying his words, mixed with a deep sadness for Alexander, whose eyes were red and nose already dripping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why had we not considered this before?&#34; I asked myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had we not thought about how our actions would affect him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I looked around the whole room, I saw the tension and sadness etched on everyone&#39;s faces. Ethan&#39;s excitement had been short-lived already, replaced by a sense of regret and uncertainty for saying his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. I knew that we had to make things right now to find a way to include Alexander in our plans for the vacation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for now, the room was filled with an uncomfortable silence and killing tension, the only sound Alexander&#39;s heartbreaking sobs with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a lump form down in my throat as I watched him, my heart aching with sadness for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that we had to do something to make this right in this family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what?&#34; This was the question running through my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Ethan eyeball to eyeball, hoping that he would have some answers to give me, but he just shook his head slowly, looking helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath in and out, trying to think of something to give everyone a smirk on their faces-anything that we could do to fix this challenge. And then, suddenly, an idea struck me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t we make this a family vacation for everyone?&#34; I exclaimed, trying to sound enthusiastic just to give all a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can find a way to include Alexander, to make him feel part of it and not left out,&#34; I smiled forcefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan looked at me, a glimmer of hope in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; he asked, his voice barely above a whisper still giving me a werid glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought for a moment with no words, just trying to come up with a solution for all this. And then it struck me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can just find a resort that caters to families,&#34; I said, excitement growing in my voice quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One that has activities and amenities for kids also. In that way, Alexander can come with us, and we can all spend quality time together as a family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s face lit up with excitement also, and he turned to Alexander, who was still sobbing quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, buddy, what do you say about this idea?&#34; He asked, his voice full of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Want to come with us on vacation, as family?&#34; Ethan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander looked up to his father, his eyes red and puffy from crying. He sniffled and then nodded positively, a small smile on his face already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a surge of relief wash me, mixed with happiness and excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe, just maybe, we could make this work and still have a good time. Maybe we could find a way to include Alexander in our plans to make him feel part of our family again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we three hugged, the tension in the room began to dissipate little by little, replaced by a sense of hope and possibility within all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We still had a long way to go on all this, but for now, we had taken the first step towards healing, towards becoming a family again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Alexander, I would have a chat with your dad?&#34; I said as soon as everyone departed from the hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A chat now?&#34; Ethan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I added with a grin on my face, holding Ethan by his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried pulling himself out, but I still held him, dragging him through the staircase leading to both rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; he interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to the romantic names we talked about?&#34; he asked as I raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you possed?&#34; He gave me a strange look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why asking such a thing, my little sunshine?&#34; he smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cause you act like one,&#34; I confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What? Why?&#34; He exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spare me, Ethan,&#34; I sat on the bed quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just acted so abnormal and not immature.&#34; I raised an eyebrow arrogantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My little sunshine.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up,&#34; I whispered.</p>
