                <p>Mia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this stage, getting out of the hospital and gaining peace, I was already happy with all that, and so I decided to have fun with my life already and promised myself not to go back to the dark shells I once stayed in at the early stage of my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, can we talk about something?&#34; Ethan said with a dripping and also warning look to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him with a wide smile on my face, with my thoughts running through my head, thinking about what he wanted us to discuss, and from his expression, it sounded like something serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we can.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise not to be angry.&#34; I gave him an awkward look this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What does he mean? He thinks I get angry over little issues or what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What that look on your face?&#34; He asked calmly with a neutral expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just go ahead with your question,&#34; I said with a smile to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; he took a quick breath in and out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we just deal with something?&#34; he gazed at me as I raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What could that be this time?&#34; I asked him as my eyes darkened quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we start calling each other&#39;s romantic names instead of this, Ethan and Mia?&#34; My jaw dropped with these words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just had to give a smirk, adding a crazy and stupid reaction to him with barely a neutral look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it funny or too much to ask?&#34; He smiled. &#34;And if you don&#39;t want that, I can just continue with the regular name,&#34; he smirked to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe what I was hearing at this time. Ethan wanted us to start using romantic names for each other, like newlywed? I thought he was joking at first, but the serious and Stern look on his face told me otherwise of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Romantic names?&#34; I repeated, trying to stifle a giggle, but it just turned out to be a low chuckle, which was annoying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean like we calling ourselves...sweetheart or honey?&#34; Ethan nodded, his eyes sparkling with amusement at the words, which sounded odd to me already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. Something just like that.&#34; He chuckled excitedly, leaving me shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow with a deep glance to Bim, trying to process this new and odd development.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. &#34;And what really makes you think I&#39;d be okay with this new prompt?&#34; Ethan shrugged, his smile faltering for a moment with my question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. &#34;I just thought it would be nice to have something special between us both. You know, like a secret language that couple&#39;s have.&#34; I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at this statement of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A secret language for couples? You&#39;re such a little goofball, Ethan.&#34; I laughed like I have never done for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s face lit up with a smile also, and it makes me feel off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, I&#39;m serious about this, Mia! I want us to have something that&#39;s just ours and what other couples  have.&#34; I shook my head, still chuckling over his words to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, that&#39;s fine. But if I eventually start calling you&#39;sweetcheeks&#39; or something similar, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you about this.&#34; Ethan grinned, relief written all over his face already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a deal. And I promise to come up with something equally cheesy for you as you made one for me already.&#34; He smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes plus eyebrow, laughing at his every statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is going to be very interesting.&#34; As we continued to banter back and forth to me, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of excitement wash me from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a new side of Ethan. I hadn&#39;t seen before since we started this forced love, and I had to admit it, I was intrigued by this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, so what&#39;s my new name going to be like?&#34; I asked, raising an eyebrow and giving him a deep look through his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan thought for a moment before a sly grin spread across his face plus a bold smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. &#34;I&#39;ve got it already. From now on, you&#39;re my little&#39;sunshine&#39;.&#34; I groaned, laughing at his words and also giving him a blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s so corny and sweet.&#34; Ethan just chuckled back at me, his eyes sparkling with amusement towards my blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you said I could come up with something cheesy for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I playfully hit him on the arm, giving him a little smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. &#34;Yeah, but I didn&#39;t mean that cheesy.&#34; Ethan just laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too late now, my little sunshine. You&#39;re stuck with it, and it would be forever.&#34; She laughed once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, shaking my head in a shivering manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a feeling I&#39;m totally going to regret all this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan just grinned, his face lighting up with excitement already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise you won&#39;t regret a single part of this. Now, come on, my little sunshine. Let&#39;s go get some lunch.&#34; She held my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we walked out of my room, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of happiness within. This was a new beginning for us in this secret language empire and a chance to start fresh and leave the past behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And who knows, maybe this silly romantic name thing would actually bring us closer together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over lunch time, Ethan couldn&#39;t stop calling me &#34;my little sunshine&#34;. It was totally annoying at first, but eventually, I found myself smiling every time he said it to me. It was like he had unlocked a new level of cheesiness within me, and I couldn&#39;t help but be charmed by it already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we finished up the meals and prepared to part ways, Ethan turned to me with a serious and Stern look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, my little sunshine?&#34; He said, his voice low and gentle to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m really glad we&#39;re doing this already. I feel like we&#39;re finally moving forward into a better relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, feeling a sense of agreement, which was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too, Ethan. Me too.&#34; I realized I made a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, you would totally get used to all this.&#34;.</p>
