                <p>I seethed with deep anger as I watched Mia and Ethan picture together, with me weeping within myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could she move on so quickly and have no feelings for me anymore?&#34; I asked myself with anger within myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t she know that I was the one who truly loved her and could do anything for her? added with a groan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, my mind raced with ways to get her quick back to myself, to make her see that I was the only one for her and could take care of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then a quick plan formed. A plan to make her suffer and make her regret choosing the loser instead of me, to make her realize what she had lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nate! &#34; I carried up the name with a loud voice, with veins visible on my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes are turning pale already, and tears are about to fill up my face with what I just saw. Rejection from the girl I loved with everything, only because I left her when she needed me the most, but something she just didn&#39;t understand was that I did everything I did because of her and her well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss,&#34; the young, hefty figure drew himself closer to my standing position. I turbed back around, looking at the young man with his head down and chest breathing hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need your help,&#34; my voice filled with anger and malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened, boss?&#34; He asked with concern about my statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to deal with someone,&#34; he interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one touches that tail of a lion and goes out so freely,&#34; he sniffed in hard as I gazed at him up until down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nice!&#34;&#34;I chuckled within myself. &#34;I swear to do anything within myself to get them out of my way.&#34; I grinned, saying the words slowly, just like a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what is the plan?&#34; He asked with a huge frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Killing, of course; taking my enemy out of the way; doing what you are good at!&#34; The young man laughed out so loudly with evil filled within his laughter and excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just get that done,&#34; he concluded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Wait.&#34;&#34;As he turned around, I called him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, sir,&#34; he slightly bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you need his information?&#34; I said to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; he said quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just told him all I knew about my so-called enemy and the one I wanted out of my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left me all alone in the room, filled with darkness, and myself filled with thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head is running with different thoughts, as if it were a race, and it is very important that I do so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I jumped up from the bed after discovering the perfect plan I needed to get my perfect revenge on those who wanted me out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into the bathroom with no dress, taking a quick shower before putting on normal office wear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I applied all I wanted, with a smile as well. My mind was still filled with all my thoughts and what I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked out of the room, picking up one of the cars, with a bodyguard beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath and finally had a had a concussion on my plan, and I just couldn&#39;t wait to do what I had in mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, am I to attack the villain as soon as we arrive at his place?&#34; Nate questioned with his visible curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I have another plan that is better than attacking now.&#34; I gave an evil smile as I ended those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Directing the driver was quite hard for me and wasn&#39;t easy, but still, you have already arrived at my destination. Arriving at that main place, I wanted to have my great revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the office&#34; I said as soon as I stepped out of the car, adjusting my suit to fit well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, sir,&#34;&#34;he groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked through the hallway of the large skyscraper building, taking each elevator to approach my destination. Soon I was there, standing in front of the young, cool lady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, sir, please, what can I do for you?&#34; She gave a bold smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Ethan?&#34; I asked rudely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, my boss is quite busy now and can&#39;t see anyone.&#34; Her smile just gets bolder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if I tell you I am his brother and I need to see him for family issues?&#34; I said with a much more serious and stern voice to the lady that just prevented me from walking in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have to confirm that,&#34; she smiled, picking up her fax phone quickly while keeping me there, standing with my hefty guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes of waiting for her, she just gave me words that made me angry. &#34;Sorry, he denied access,&#34; she smiled and got me more angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Nate! Pack her up,&#34; she said, wearing a quick Stern look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean, sir?&#34; She questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard me, right?&#34; As Nate approached her, holding up her mouth tight, she took advantage to walk into the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so shocking to see both my enemies there, standing as if they were already waiting for my presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Ethan?&#34; I groaned as I walked into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get in here?&#34; His face was already filled with surprise, as was that of his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a long story,&#34; I said with a deep chuckle, walking towards the two who glanced at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of here now?!&#34; Mia said it with anger in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonsense,&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just came here for a serious issue.&#34; My words got immediately interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First of all, you would discuss all that in prison,&#34; Ethan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just want to prolong this issue,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; Mia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice question?&#34; I grinned, stepping towards Mia, whose anger was already visible in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked into my wrist watch. &#34;I have less time here, so I would speak fast.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then do,&#34; Ethan interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, you have one week to come back to me unless,&#34; Ethan interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unless what?&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blood would flow and heads would roll.&#34;.</p>
