                <p>&#34;You know our main reason here, Amanda.&#34; As I was passing by the door of my mother&#39;s room, I heard the words that made me stand by the doorside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother, she&#39;s so hard and prevents me from coming closer,&#34; her voice filled with malice, keeping me in suspense already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were my mother and sister talking about already? Why do I feel as if I was the main topic of the day in their room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just still stood there with clearly no way that I wanted to leave until I got the whole information I needed from them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two in the room just didn&#39;t say a word again while I stood there; it felt as if they knew I was standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood frozen in the doorway, my ears straining to hear more of the conversation between my mother and Amanda, which made me curious and my ear inching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the room fell so silent, as if they knew I was listening to their conversation. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I wondered what they were discussing in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was I the main topic of their conversation? After a few moments of silence and tension, I realized I wasn&#39;t going to hear anything else from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly backed away from the doorway and made my way to my room, my mind racing with lots of thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. Why was Amanda saying I was hard and prevented myself from coming closer to her? What did she mean by those words?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I lay on my bed with thought, I couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling that something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. And then I remembered the conversation I had with Amanda earlier. The way she had been acting so strange and hurtful towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all started to make real sense now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as I thought I had figured it out already, I remembered something else from the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something that made my blood run cold immediately. The way Amanda had been looking at me earlier, the way she had been talking to me with no respect. It was all so familiar to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then it quickly hit me. The realization that made my heart skip a beat as if I slipped down. Amanda&#39;s behavior, werid, was all because of what happened to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I had been trying to forget for so long, my past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat up in bed, my heart racing with fear and anxiety. No, it couldn&#39;t just be. It was just my imagination playing tricks on me this time. But the thought lingered more, haunting me down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to calm myself down at this point, telling myself I was just being paranoid over the matter. But the memory of Amanda&#39;s words kept echoing in my mind as if a memory card was there that kept on playing it all over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just a fake person, Mia. A totally fake wife, a fake mother, a fake person living in a fake world.&#34; What did she totally mean by all that? And why did it sound so familiar to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I lay there with thought, trying to make sense of everything that was happening, I heard a faint noise coming from outside my room quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded like footsteps from behind, light and cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, my heart pounding in my chest so loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was it? And what did they want?&#34; I asked within myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly got out of bed and approached the door slowly, my ears pressed against it with a still racing heart, trying to hear any sound again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was total silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited for what felt like an eternity to hear the sound, but there was no other sound again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly backed away from the door with fear, my mind racing with thoughts and questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could it be by this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to shake off the feeling of unease that built within, telling myself it was just my imagination playing tricks on me once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. But the thought lingered within, haunting me. And then I heard it again-the same voice. The faint noise from outside my room, the light footsteps. This time, they were much closer to the room door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze quickly, my heart pounding in my chest with deep fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was it by this time? And what did they want from me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly turned the handle of the door and opened the door, my heart racing with fear and anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then I saw her. Amanda. Standing in the hallway with a nightdress and a sly smile on her face like one evil being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want by this time again, Amanda?&#34; I asked, trying to keep my voice steady and calm just not to disturb anyone since it was already late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to talk to you like sisters that we really are, Mia,&#34; she said, her voice sweet and innocent like that of a new child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I totally knew better of her. I knew she was hiding something from me, or she needs something from me, which she can do anything to get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about that Amanda?&#34; I asked, trying to stay calm and gentle with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About what happened previously,&#34; she said, her eyes glinting with malice while mine with mild fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About what you&#39;vebeen totally trying to forget for ages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a little beat as I realized what she was talking about already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thing I had been trying to forget for so long, my past. The thing that had haunted me for years and had decided to keep back in my life and not try to ruin my present self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Amanda, why?&#34; I said, trying to back away from her, giving a few inches back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Amanda was too quick to embrace me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed my arm, her grip tight to mine, keeping me in pain since I know what she&#39;s capable of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t run away from the truth forever, Mia,&#34; she said to me, her voice calm and calculating while mine filled with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s time you faced it-the reality of the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amanda, for real, what&#39;s your main purpose here?&#34; I asked her while she smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just nothing, dear Amanda, but something that you once rejected and ran away from.&#34;.</p>
