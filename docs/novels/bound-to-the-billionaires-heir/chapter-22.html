                <p>I sat in the sitting room couch with eyes fixed on me as if I were one big-time criminal caught in his action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart bit fast gazing at Ethan plus the security guard that surrounded us both. My eyes filled with fear and my heart filled with thoughts of how I could just escape from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With anxiety, deep breath, and a sigh, I sat much closer to the chair edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want now?&#34; I questioned the tiung man, who couldn&#39;t just let his eyes off me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want peace and nothing more.&#34; I relaxed my back and laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of peace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The one you know,&#34; Ethan replied as the guard started leaving one after the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I was about to say my words, the buzz from Ethan&#39;s phone interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whose that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me, still his eyes on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Lucy,&#34; my mood changed with the mention of that name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes narrowed so wide already with my mind racing with thoughts of what Madam Lucy wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer it,&#34; I said, my voice firm and fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s eyes never left mine as he answered the call with his own firm look and voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear her voice on the other end, but couldn&#39;t make out what she was saying to Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s expression changed from calm to concerned, his eyes darting back and forth as he still placed the phone in his ear area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? When?&#34; he asked, his voice rising and giving me little fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart began to race at that moment, my mind filling with worst-case scenarios that have negativity filled within them. What was my mother saying to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s eyes locked onto mine, his gaze piercing and stabbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle it, ma&#39;am,&#34; he said, his voice cold and which made me have a lot of curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended, and Ethan&#39;s eyes never left mine, and his way made me to be engaged in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems your mother has been causing trouble again,&#34; he said, his voice dripping with anger and arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped all because of his words, which also put thinking in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What had my mother done this time? &#34;What did she do?&#34; I asked myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s smile was sinister and calm, like a warm water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s been spreading rumors about our marriage, about our child. She&#39;s trying to ruin our reputation.&#34; His words just made me to be provoked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to take care of this, Mia. We can&#39;t let your mother ruin everything we&#39;ve worked for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; I questioned the young man with an arrogant look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just let focus on your mother&#39;s word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by take care of this&#34;? I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I opened my mouth to speak another word, Ethan&#39;s phone buzzed again, making me stop speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. &#34;I need to take this,. Mia,&#34; he said, his voice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up, his eyes stuck into mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll continue this conversation later, Mia. But for now, I need to handle this situation.&#34; As soon as he was done with his call, he had to confess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he turned and walked away, leaving me alone in the sitting room with curiosity, my heart racing with fear and my mind filling with questions after questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening? What was Ethan planning to do? And what did my mom have to do with any of it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sat there, my mind reeling with a lot thoughts, I heard the sound of footsteps outside the room. The door opened, and a figure stepped inside, which made me look in the direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat as I saw who it was. Andrew, my ex-boyfriend. What was he doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia,&#34; he said, his voice low. &#34;We need to talk now,&#34;&#34; my heart began to race fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes narrowed, my mind filling with suspicion. What did he want? And how did he even get past Ethan&#39;s security?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I could ask any questions, Andrew&#39;s eyes locked onto mine, with me gazing at his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mother is in trouble, Mia. And we need to help her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart raced, my mind filling with less fear already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What has my mother done now? And how were we going to get her out of this mess that she stuck herself into?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I opened my mouth to speak again, Andrew interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to act fast, Mia. Before it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he turned and walked away, leaving me alone in the sitting room, my heart racing with fear and my mind filling with questions and queries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening? What was going on already? And how were we going to get out of this mess that had already happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sat there with my mind racing with thoughts, I heard the sound of footsteps outside the room. The door opened, and Ethan stepped inside with his usual smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, we need to talk now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat with Ethan&#39;s request to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he want again from me?&#34;I asked myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what did he have to do with my mother&#39;s troubles that he was giving a lot of concern to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I could say anything, Ethan&#39;s eyes seemed to bore into my soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to take care of your mother, Mia.&#34; He paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once and for all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After his few words, he turned back and walked away once more, leaving me alone in the sitting room, my heart racing with thoughts and my mind filling with questions that have no answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does Ethan Mean?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what did he plan to do with her?&#34; I rained questions on myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do I even care about the one who destroyed my life?&#34; I asked myself, grinning my teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sat there, my head filled with thoughts, I realized that it seems like I am in deep danger already and clearly on the way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I had no idea how to get out of this mess that had already happened in the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Or is this a gave that I would play another pawn in &#34;</p>
