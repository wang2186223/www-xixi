                <p>&#34;Did you both ever have sex during the relationship?&#34; Ethan asked as we all sat down there at the round table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were the one who disregarded me,&#34; I replied in a state of confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, why is he here asking for the child?&#34; Ethan asked calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is also what I am confused about,&#34; I rubbed my hair, filled with confusion already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This just isn&#39;t fair. Why is my life going this way? I thought my life was about taking a better turn, but this time I just became worse,&#34; I said with my hands rubbing all over my hair, showing the confusion physically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Ethan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s something I can&#39;t just bring to the table since it reminds me of my past most often.&#34; My eyes already started getting wet slowly with me just saying the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia.&#34; I interrupted my mother at that point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother, you are the whole cause of this confusion in this family.&#34; My mother has a more concerned look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; How? What did I do wrong?&#34; She asked with a pitiful look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are asking me what you did wrong? You are just a shame,&#34; I said as I stood up with anger flowing through my veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch your tongue, Mia!&#34; My mom also stood up with anger in her voice stream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are a strong disgrace to motherhood,&#34; I spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, that is our mother you are talking to.&#34; Amanda stood up with her own anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And so what, coward?&#34; I looked in Amanda&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia,&#34; I gave my warning to her as she mentioned my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you ever call my name from that hole in your ugly face?&#34; I just released all my anger with my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned with deep anger within me, and the room filled with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, no one is talking now?&#34; I broke the quick silence in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, please calm down. Let&#39;s resolve this issue calmly,&#34; Ethan requested as he held on to my arms slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dragged my arm away from his. &#34;You are also a coward, Ethan.&#34; I looked to him as we both eye-pieced each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What!&#34; He gave a surprise look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myself and Andrew almost got into hand-to-hand combat, and you still stood there looking like an animal,&#34; he just gave a little chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s funny with what I just said?&#34; I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s really funny here is that you&#39;re acting like a child, Mia,&#34; Ethan said, his voice calm and firm, which just made me increase my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to figure out how to deal with Andrew, not fight him physically and with you and have issues with everyone.&#34; He looked into my eyes calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him, my anger boiling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t understand anything, Ethan. You never have. You&#39;re just like the rest of them, always trying to calm me down and make me see reason. But I don&#39;t want to see the reason. I want to make Andrew pay for what he&#39;s done to me. I want him to experience the betrayal I got from him. &#34;Tears dripped down my eyes slowly, with my heart filled with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother stepped forward, her eyes filled with concern and pity, which was kind of legit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, darling, we need to talk about this once and for all. We need to figure out what&#39;s best for you and the baby, plus we need to keep you both safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed. A bitter sound came from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s best for me and the baby? You don&#39;t even know what that means. You&#39;ve never been there for me, mother. You&#39;ve never supported me, and you have never shown me motherly love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, we&#39;re just trying to help. We just want what&#39;s best for you and Alex.&#34; Amanda Said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her, my anger and hurt pouring out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s best for me and the baby? You don&#39;t even know what that means. You&#39;ve never been a mother, Amanda. You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be raped and don&#39;t have a shoulder to stay on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent, and the tension was thick and heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel the weight of my words deep within-the pain and anger that I was carrying around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that I was hurting my family already, but I couldn&#39;t stop. I couldn&#39;t stop the pain and anger from pouring out of me at this stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I stood there for a while, my eyes filled with tears that were dropping, and I felt my body begin to shake and shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wept, wailed, and screamed, my body shaking with sobs and sorrow. I felt like I was losing myself at this point, like I was drowning in a sea of pain and anger plus fraud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My family tried as much to comfort me, but I pushed them away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. I didn&#39;t want their comfort anymore. I didn&#39;t want their support. I just wanted to be left alone, to wallow in my own pain and anger, plus fraud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as I wept deeply, I knew that I couldn&#39;t stay like this forever. I just knew that I had to find a way to move on with life and let the past be, to find a way to deal with Andrew and his claims over the child that isn&#39;t his. I knew that I had to find a way to be strong like before, for myself and for my baby boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so I took a deep breath, with thoughts in my head, and I began to calm down slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I began to think about trying to come up with plans since I knew that I couldn&#39;t do it alone, but I also knew that I couldn&#39;t trust my family or anyone not exculding Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed someone else, someone who could help me and support me all the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, after a long time of thinking, like a bolt of lightning, it hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew exactly what I needed to do. I knew exactly who I needed to turn to and face trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Google,&#34; I said with a forced smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to Google something.&#34; I said I was picking up my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone just looked at me, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you need to Google now, Mia?&#34; my mother asked with an unfamiliar face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just smiled, a small smile on my face, a determined smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to Google how to get a restraining order to settle things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent quickly, the tension thick and heavy within everyone&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that I had to make a decision-a decision that might change things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as I sat there, my eyes fixed on the screen of my phone, I knew that I was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was ready to take control of my life and of my situation. I was ready to face Andrew; anytime he comes again, trying to claim something that doesn&#39;t belong to him,.</p>
