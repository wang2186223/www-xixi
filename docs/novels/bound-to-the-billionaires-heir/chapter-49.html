                <p>&#34;How do you expect me to trust that kind of person again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she said it was a mistake.&#34; Ethan just kept on saying words that make me think otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of mistake is that?&#34; I asked rudely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one is perfect,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Perfect! Perfect,you say,&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Putting poison in my dish, and you call that a mistake.&#34; I just kept up hissing on every one of my statements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t plan for that,&#34; I interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t she smell?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you taste?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you on my side or on her own side?&#34; I questioned sitting up immediately, despite the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On no one side,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But... &#34; He interrupted my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got to have a forgiving spirit.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at Ethan, my anger boiling over with his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just making excuses for her, right?&#34; I spat to his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She tried to kill me, Ethan. My own blood sister.&#34; I couldn&#39;t believe he was defending her after what she had done to me, after faking her words. I have known her for almost 20 years, and I know what she is literally capable of doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan held up his hands, trying to placate me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, please. Just listen to me. Amanda is sorry for her bad action. She didn&#39;t mean to hurt you.&#34; But I wasn&#39;t having it at all. I was beyond reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry? Sorry isn&#39;t enough at all for what she did. She could have killed me if I wasn&#39;t rushed in here,&#34; I repeated, my voice rising with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just couldn&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t understand the severity of the situation at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door to my hospital room opened, and Amanda walked in with a pityful look with Alexander by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My anger surged again with just setting my eyes on her, and I felt my heart racing and pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare she show her face here?&#34; I asked myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get her out of here now,&#34; I demanded of her, pointing at Amanda as we made a few steps in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to see her face, didn&#39;t want to talk to her, or have anything to do with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ethan just shook his head, turning to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, please calm down. Just talk to her like sisters.&#34; He was still trying to defend her even when I warned about that, still trying to make excuses for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my gaze on Amanda quickly, my eyes blazing with anger and frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have absolutely nothing to say to me,&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve done enough damage already.&#34; I couldn&#39;t believe she had the nerve to come here to try to apologize to me after keeping my life hanging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda looked down, tears streaming down her face like one little baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, I&#39;m so... so sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you or anything. I love you like a sister.&#34; But I just laughed, a bitter sound from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You love me? You call hanging my life, love?&#34; I repeated with a mean lokm, my voice dripping with sarcasm and anger. She didn&#39;t know the meaning of the word she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander took a step forward to me, his eyes worried also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, please. Just listen to Amanda.&#34; But I shook my head with a sigh, my anger hurt too much to bear alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get them both out of here,&#34; I demanded, turning my back on themball. I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan sighed and stood up, ushering Amanda and Alexander out of the room. But I knew this wasn&#39;t over yet. Not by a long shot, nor by a short one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they were gone, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tired of the whole drama, tired of the pain and suffering. I just wanted to be left alone for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I knew that wasn&#39;t possible. Not now, not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; I turned to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are cruel, Mia,&#34; he said with dripping anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what you have to tell me now?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you even do that to your child, sending him out of the ward?&#34; His eyes were filled with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a little boy, and that isn&#39;t a problem,&#34; he kept on attacking my words as if it were a huge fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You say it&#39;s not a problem, keeping that little boy crying outside because his mother just took him as a less important human being.&#34; Ethan was fully filled with anger already, and this just made me more pale that I have fewer words to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Ethan...&#34; He interrupted, his voice filled with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me complete my words.&#34; He exclaimed with rage of raging anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have just forgiven her and given her another chance,&#34; I interrupted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By chance, do you know what I have passed through in the hands of that lady I call a sister?&#34; I groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s your past, Mia; everyone has their own past, and you can&#39;t use your past to judge your own future,&#34; he said, bringing himself closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And so she hated me,&#34; he interrupted once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sold you out,&#34; I glanced at him awkwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You say that same line every time, Mia. Mia, you have to really change for the better&#34; he picked up his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; he turned around to walk out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have other issues to take care of, Mia, and a child plus in-law to take home and plead with,&#34; he walked out of me.</p>
