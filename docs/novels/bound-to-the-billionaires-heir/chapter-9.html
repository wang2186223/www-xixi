                <p>Mia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With me looking out of my parents house window, it was already turning dark, with evening approaching gradually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up to the moon, which was about to come out in a few minutes. I closed my eyes, saying some words to myself, wishing for the moon to grant them to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without me completing my wish, the loud and steamy cry of my child interrupted. I left my sitting area and walked into my room with. As my eyes caught with those of my sister, I quickly wore a frown walking up to my baby, which she held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dragged my baby from her with anger at seeing her. I gave a hiss to her immediately, claiming my child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing in here?&#34; I questioned as I tried to calm my little baby down to reduce his crying and screeching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard him crying, so I came to check up on him.&#34; My sister faded a nice and beautiful voice to me, still behaving like one of the good children a parent had, while she was more than a devil angel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her life was like that of a snake. She&#39;s just filled with a lot of kids and negativity, which just makes me automatically hate her after discovering she&#39;s also part of my mother&#39;s evil intention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I say, revealing a fake smile as I tried walking out. My sister held me with her words, which just made me turn around with so much revealing anger in both my words and her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you ever call up that name again!&#34; I yelled at her with pointing fingers as she just looked at me with less grief but a chuckle, which I just ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he&#39;s the father of your baby.&#34; I looked at her with a lot of annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words caused more pain to me, as I remember how I got raped on the day I was supposed to be happy. The day the one&#39;s I called family sold me out to someone I never liked all because of the wealth and riches they wanted for themselves, not them knowing the kind of pain they already placed me into. The kind of pain that could make me kill myself with in a blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmmmm,&#34; I sniffed, giving my reaction to her not minding the sobbing baby I held tightly. &#34;My baby doesn&#39;t have a father.&#34; As soon as I said, my sister revealed the laughter she hid within herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be joking,&#34; she laughed more to her own words as I just looked at her with no other words coming out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have two choices in this house: either you live...&#34; She couldn&#39;t finish her words before I added mine to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or you stay,&#34; I paused with a slight chuckle as tears dripped off my eyes slowly. &#34;Isn&#39;t that what you want to say?&#34; I asked, giving her another hiss as I walked out of the room singing baby songs for my little baby, who was still crying without me knowing his main reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stormed out of the room, my baby still crying in my arms so hard. But I still couldn&#39;t bear to stay in the same space as my sister plus mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their words, piercing my soul like a dagger without them seeing fault in themselves but seeing the whole fault in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a lot of thinking and making my baby to sleep, I walked into my room, my heart racing with anger and pain. I gently rocked my baby, trying to calm him down as I stared at the wall, my mind racing with thoughts of escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t take it anymore, living in this toxic environment, surrounded by people who only cared about themselves. My mother, my sister-they were all the same-manipulative and cruel. I thought about my father, how he had left us, abandoning me to this fate. I felt a surge of determination; I had to get out of here, for my baby&#39;s sake, for my own sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I began to pack my bags, my hands shaking with emotion. I stuffed clothes, diapers, and formula into a small suitcase, my mind racing with plans. I had to leave, but I had to do it secretly. I couldn&#39;t let them know; they would only try to stop me. I thought about the money I had saved, hidden away from prying eyes. It would be enough to get us started, to find a new life, a new home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I packed, my baby FINALLY woke up with his eyes piercing into mine. I gazed at him, my heart overflowing with love. I would do anything to protect him, to give him a better life, even if I was supposed to kill people to provide for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finished packing, my suitcase bulging with our belongings. I took a deep breath, my heart pounding in my chest. It was time to leave, to start a new life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crept out of my room, my suitcase in hand, my baby sleeping again in his carrier. I made my way to the front door, my heart racing with excitement and fear. I opened the door, a burst of cool air hitting me like a slap in the face. I took a deep breath, the night air filling my lungs. I stepped out into the darkness, my suitcase rolling behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was quiet, the only sound being the crickets chirping in the bushes. I walked quickly into the almost empty street, my heart pounding in my chest as if I went through a long race. I had to get as far away from the house as possible before they realized I was gone. I thought about my sister&#39;s words, her mocking laughter still echoing in my mind. I felt a surge of anger, but I pushed it aside, focusing on the task at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked, the darkness seemed to swallow me whole. I felt like I was disappearing, leaving behind the pain and the heartache. I thought about my baby, his small face scrunched up in sleep. I felt a surge of love, a sense of purpose. I was doing this for him, for us, for our future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like hours, I saw a light in the distance. It was a small motel with a neon sign reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vacancy&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>in bold letters. I quickened my pace, my suitcase rolling behind me. I pushed open the door, a bell ringing out as I entered. The receptionist looked up, a bored expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Room for the night?&#34; he asked, his voice calm and cool as I looked at him with a small smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, my heart still racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, please,&#34; I replied, my voice barely above a whisper. He handed me a key, his eyes flicking to my baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I tried making steps further, I turned back to the man. &#34;How much for the night?&#34; I questioned with a nervous feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;20$&#34; I felt a relief since I was able to afford that even for a month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked back, he said with his calm voice, &#34;Cute kid,&#34; he said, a small smile playing on his lips. I smiled back, feeling a sense of gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I replied, taking more steps further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way to the room, my suitcase rolling behind me. I unlocked the door, a sense of relief washing over me. I was safe; we were safe. I lay down on the bed, my baby still sleeping in his carrier. I closed my eyes, my heart still racing with excitement and fear. I knew I had made the right decision; I had to get out of there, for my baby&#39;s sake, for my own sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I drifted off to sleep, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, but I was ready. I was ready to face whatever came our way, as long as I had my baby by my side and had peace.</p>
