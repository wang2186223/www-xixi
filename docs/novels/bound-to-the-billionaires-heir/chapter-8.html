                <p>My life is just like a written story based on one particular aspect where the antagonist strikes more than the original protagonist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Me seeking peace was something I literally knew was much far away from where I was at that stage of my own miserable and damaged life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got sold out all because of some wish my family wanted and I wasn&#39;t interested in. My mother always wanted fame and popularity, and she could go the extra mile in doing anything for what she desperately desired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My life is a tumultuous tale of pain and betrayal, my dreams and desires constantly thwarted by the selfish ambitions of those around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother&#39;s insatiable thirst for fame and popularity has become a heavy chain, weighing me down and suffocating my own aspirations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m now a shadow of my former self, my light dimmed by the cruel twists of fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My world is a dark and treacherous landscape, where the antagonist&#39;s cruel hand looms large, crushing my spirit and shattering my soul. The quest for peace and happiness seems an impossible feat, a distant dream that mocks me with its elusiveness. The scars of my past linger, a constant reminder of the pain and suffering I&#39;ve endured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this bleak landscape, my heart remains a heavy burden, weighed down by the shackles of my mother&#39;s making. My passion and creativity have been reduced to smoldering embers, flickering weakly in the face of adversity. Yet, deep within me, a spark of resilience remains, a glimmer of hope that refuses to be extinguished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My childhood memories are now a distant blur, a faded tapestry of joy and laughter, forever marred by the dark threads of my mother&#39;s ambition. The love and support I once knew have been replaced by a cold, calculating gaze, a constant reminder that I&#39;m nothing more than a pawn in her game of fame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My days blend together in a haze of despair, a never-ending cycle of pain and sorrow. My nights are filled with tears and anguish, my mind racing with thoughts of a life I once knew, a life I can never have. The city around me is a cold, unforgiving beast, its streets and alleys a constant reminder of my isolation and loneliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people I once called friends have vanished; their faces faded from my memory like ghosts, which my family was among, and it caused me so much pain and regret deep within, plus giving me a wound that has no cure. The only constants in my life are the cameras and the spotlight, forever trained on me like a hawk, waiting for me to slip, to falter, to fail. The pressure is suffocating, a weight that presses upon my chest, making it hard to breathe, hard to think, hard to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this prison of my mother&#39;s making, my soul is slowly withering away, a delicate flower crushed by the heel of ambition. My heart is a heavy burden, a weight that threatens to consume me at any moment. The tears I cry are tears of despair, tears of anger, tears of frustration. The tears I cry are tears of a life unlived, tears of a dream deferred, tears of a soul forever lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, despite the darkness that surrounds me, despite the pain that threatens to consume me, I hold on to hope. A fragile thread of resilience remains, a glimmer of light in the darkness. It&#39;s a spark that refuses to be extinguished, a flame that flickers weakly but still burns bright. It&#39;s a reminder that no matter how dark the night, no matter how bleak the future, there&#39;s always a way out, always a way forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, darling,&#34; my mom walked in almost at the at the same time I packed up my bag with deep pain that she had caused to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked to her side as she drew closer to me with a smile that I knew was what she planned on using to make my life more bad and miserable than it is already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart always had the deep pain within itself as I saw those who brought me down into what I never planned on becoming in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I&#39;m a single mother who has to Carter for a little baby boy, who I just hustle to take care of even if two men come in dragging for the position of a father, which was like a nightmare, despite me knowing my life is just a living nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked with a more harsh voice, not even looking in her own direction, despite me noticing her immediate closeness to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia,&#34; I interrupted with my harsh words to her, which also made me look up to her at that point with a Stern and we&#39;ll take a take a serious look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you ever call that name from that mouth of yours?&#34; I gave a tune that made my mother look at me with grinning teeth that were totally visible to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother looked at me with no words from her. I bent back to arranging the dress and keeping it in a big travel-size bag. My mom kept on glancing at me with me not giving her any attention but concentrated on what I was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, I was already done with what I was doing and cleared up my throat as I placed the bag standing up right on my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, don&#39;t tell me you are traveling.&#34; My mom&#39;s voice had curiosity living in it as I just sucked my teeth loudly to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reactions I gave to my mom weren&#39;t exactly what she thought of, but I gave her a little shock, but deep within me it hurt. I had no respect for my mother, but I had to do what was right, and that was telling her the honest truth and taking my dear away and standing like a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you start to care?&#34; I asked, giving her a push to move aside from the doorside, which I made my own way out, keeping her all alone with my baby in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
