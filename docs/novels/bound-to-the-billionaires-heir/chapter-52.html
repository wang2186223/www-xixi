                <p>Mia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It already passed a few weeks since the peacemaking in the hospital, and I am already tired of saying in the hospital, &#34;Bedridden, so I had to meet the doctor to discharge me, but Ethan was needed before that could happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan came already, and I just can&#39;t wait for him to break the news for me that I would be going home and not longer staying in the hospital anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just can&#39;t wait to get back to my normal life and have a few days of peace and quiet as a normal human being that God made me to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I lay down in the hospital bed, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of restlessness wash over me. The past few weeks have been there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past few weeks had been a blur of beeping machines, sterile smells, and endless streams of visitors walking in and out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tired of being confined to this small, white room with its drab walls and flickering fluorescent lights that can scare a little baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yearned for the freedom to walk outside to the normal life, to feel the warm sun on my skin, and to breathe in the fresh air of nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To smell the sweet scent of blooming flowers and not bouquet and feel the gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze, and not that if the air conditioner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s arrival was a welcome distraction from my thoughts immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked into the room with a gentle smile on his face, his eyes crinkling at the corners with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hair was totally mussed, and his clothes were fully rumpled, but he looked handsome nonetheless from his new appearance, which was totally strange to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but feel a flutter in my chest as he approached me on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved with a quiet confidence in him, which was fully visible; his eyes locked on mine with a smirk on our faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; he said, his voice low and soothing to the ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you feeling today?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shurrged, feeling a sense of frustration wash over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m tired of being stuck in this bed morning, afternoon, and night,&#34; I admitted to the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really want to go home,&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s smile faltered, and he looked at me with concern on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you want to go home,&#34; he said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you have to be really patient. The doctor will let you know when it&#39;s safe for you to leave here and have your life.&#34; He smiled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor followed closely behind him. Interrupting us both with a clipboard clutched in his hand</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. He looked like a middle-aged man on a mission, his eyes scanning the pages with a sense of purpose and determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched anxiously as he began to scan the pages one after the other, not leaving any page unturned with, his brow furrowed in concentration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he looked up to us both, a small smile playing on his lips already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, you&#39;re doing remarkably well from what we planned,&#34; he said, his voice warm and reassuring, which also gave me little happiness within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We think it&#39;s time for you to go home now.&#34; He smiled, and this made me happier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a surge of excitement at his words that just made me giggle within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Home&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word was like a balm to my weak soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just couldn&#39;t wait to leave this place behind and start rebuilding my own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about my cozy little room, with its plush couch and soft blankets on the bed. I thought about my little garden, with its vibrant flowers and fresh herbs that help my day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s hand closed around mine, his fingers intertwining with mine in a gentle grasp and smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a sense of comfort and security wash over me as he squeezed my hand against his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll get you packed up and ready to go in a few minutes,&#34; the doctor said, his voice fading into the background while I was filled with so much happiness and joy already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind was already racing ahead of what the mansion would look like, thinking about all the things I would do once I got home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would take long walks in the park, feel the sun on my face once more, and spend hours curled up with a good book and food. I would cook my favorite meals and spend time with my son, Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the doctor finished speaking to us both, Ethan leaned forward, his eyes shining with excitement and happiness also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can go home now, Mia,&#34; he whispered, his breath tickling my ear slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded happily, a smile spreading across my own face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was ready to start my new life and free from the confines of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was ready to start living again like a normal human and not like one tied person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Ethan&#39;s help, I slowly swung my legs over the side of the bed and stood up happily, feeling a sense of peace wash over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was weak and unsteady at first, but I was determined to take control of my own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. Ethan wrapped his arm around my waist romantically, holding me close as we made our way out of the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bright sunlight was blinding as we both stepped outside, but I felt a sense of joy wash over me already. I was finally free from the hospital troubles.</p>
