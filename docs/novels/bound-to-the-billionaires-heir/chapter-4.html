                <p>&#34; How can I be pregnant&#34; as I looked into the strip in my hands with two red straight lines I just felt like giving up the ghost after seeing the result..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately felt like unseeing what I have already seen already. I took in courage and flushed up the result in the toilet with out a single cry coming out of my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pregnancy is actually a good thing that every one must be happy if despite on how they got it. And this time am literally sad about this situation, I got pregnant through take and this would affect my child as soon as he start his own life. I would never let my child to be a bastard so I must take the right turn .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Mom, thanks to you am already pregnant&#34; as soon as I approached the dinning table where my mom and my evil sister was talking about things that aren&#39;t reasonable to the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Ohh, this calls for celebration&#34; as my mom said this words I immediately felt like taking out her life and putting it into the waste bin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t expecting such reaction from my mom at that time , I thought she would literally break down at that point in which a responsible mother should fell but though it wasn&#39;t any surprise for me since she already sold me out to whom I have never seen note had with in my life only on the day he both my virginity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Am literally not surprised at all, since you already sold me out to just get yourself money and becoming famous&#34; I ran off her presence after saying those words to her . I ran quickly into my room and gad a quick fresh up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately I was done with picking up a dress and already set to leave the house for good. I picked up nothing except money to help me reach to my unknown destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Where are you off too?&#34; As I held on the door knob the question made me to give a quick gaze to who asked the question. I just gave a hiss and twisted the knob with Same character I gave earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Keep yourself and the grandchild safe&#34; my mom said to me while I walked out without knowing her reaction to the statement. But I know that she would apply a smile to her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked down to the empty street of America with my bag out on the right side if my body as I walked through the street leading to a bridge. I just walked like a sleeping zombie down to the street which was leading to one of the local Bridges that held the street and market place .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I reached up to the bridge I started crying so loud there with car horns hitting me up in my head but I ignored despite I was the one blocking the way of some car owners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Crazy, girl would you get out of there&#34; one of the car owners screeched out to me but I still ignored the words while looking close to the water that seems as if it was already calling my name .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breathe in and said some words to myself &#34; Andrew, I always love but u have to do this for both you and me just to protect myself and you&#34; I looked to my tummy with tears&#34; And this unborn child&#34; I cried out to myself as I dropped my bag to the floor and took in under deep breathe within me and took a straight move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Hey stop&#34; as soon as I held on to the bridge holding, a nice looking man with great body fragance held my hands and drew me closer to himself giving me a slap immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What wrong with you?&#34; He exclaimed as if he was angry with me or we had a fight . As he scold me in the front of the crowd, I just cried like a new born baby . Tears rolled down from my eyes uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Come with me?&#34; He dragged me along side with himself as he pushed him self through the whole crowd which some just respected him from the look of it .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young man did all the talking while I just cried unstop. The man drove me in his car with a young man who was the main driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Why do you wanna kill yourself?&#34; He asked not looking at me but his phone , with an airpod plugged in his eyes. I looked at him with still tears streaming down from my eyes but it was now calm than earlier .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I just hate my life, myself and my family in total plus everyone&#34; I said with a sobbing voice as the man just looked at me and gave a chuckle to my words as if it was a joke .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Why saying such a thing?&#34; From a chuckle it turned into laughter but I just ignored it and still sob a little bit as he gazed at me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my heart getting scattered. His face was a familiar one , his body fragance still was kind of familiar also but I still have trouble in recognizing where we met each other</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I gazed at the man, trying to place where I had seen him before, he suddenly stopped laughing and his expression turned serious. &#34;Wait a minute,&#34; he said, his eyes narrowing as he looked at me. &#34;I think I know you. You&#39;re Mia, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in surprise. &#34;How do you know my name?&#34; I asked, my voice shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man smiled. &#34;We met at a party a few months ago. You were with your sister, and we talked for a bit. I&#39;m Ethan, by the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I racked my brain, trying to remember the party he was talking about. And then, it hit me. The party where my sister and mother had tried to set me up with one of her friends. I had been so uncomfortable that I had ended up leaving early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan must have seen the recognition in my eyes because he nodded. &#34;That&#39;s right. I remember you now. You were really upset that night, and I ended up walking you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a wave of shame wash over me. I had been so caught up in my own problems that I hadn&#39;t even recognized the man who was at my own party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan expression softened. &#34;Hey, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not going to judge you. But you need to tell me what&#39;s going on</p>
