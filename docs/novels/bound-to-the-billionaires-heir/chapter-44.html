                <p>&#34;Ethan, we have two new ones, bad and the other good, so which should I start from?&#34; I asked with a calm and smooth voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Start with the bad one,&#34; he said as he made his way to sit beside me on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I said, hiding my quick smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AAndrew, didn&#39;t take down the court case as we warned.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not that bad since I have Sophia by my side.&#34; I just smiled to him, my heart racing with anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good news!&#34; he screeched with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He accepted the court case of next week,&#34; he just frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why that face?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s that good news?&#34; He asked rudely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s good news; he accepted the court case,&#34; he exhaled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He must always come to the court case,&#34; he said, standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, so Andrew didn&#39;t take down the court case as we warned him,&#34; I said, trying to sound calm and smooth while still going through my old statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that&#39;s pretty bad.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s not Mia,&#34; Ethan agreed, his expression serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we knew he might not listen to us both. That&#39;s why we actually have Sophia on our side.&#34; He said his voice was cracking as if it were a glitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; I said, smiling to myself and thinking deep down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With Sophia&#39;s help and her on our side, we can handle whatever Andrew throws our way.&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good news!&#34; Ethan suddenly exclaimed, his face lighting up with excitement, giving me a quick heart attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He accepted the court case for next week!&#34; He laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned at him, confusion etched on my face. &#34;Why is that good news? And why this character?&#34; I asked, giving her a werid look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan looked at me like I was crazy and weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because he has to show up to court now! We can finally get this over with and have a little peace.&#34; Ethan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, still not understanding this new expression toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what if he tries to weasel his way out of it?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stood up after my question, pacing back and forth across the room with thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He can&#39;t. He&#39;s already agreed to the court case. He has to show up now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, feeling a sense of relief wash over me at this point, still thinking about the court case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. &#34;Okay, I guess that is good news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stopped pacing and turned to me, a serious expression on his face as he attacked mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to make sure we&#39;re prepared for this court case. We can&#39;t let Andrew get the upper hand over us.&#34; Ethan exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said, my mind already racing with strategies and ideas on how to deal with the rival. &#34;Let&#39;s get to work.&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the next few days of our lives, Ethan and I worked tirelessly to prepare for the court case ahead of us both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We gathered evidence, practiced our arguments, and consulted with Sophia to make sure we were ready for anything that would show up that day and anything Andrew might throw our way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the day of the court case arrived, and all of us were filled with anxiety and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was nervous but confident as we made our way to the courtroom, with all the things running through my head over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew was already there, his smug expression making my blood boil with anger and determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t let it get to me and keep me down. I took a deep breath, stood up straight, and faced the judge with confidence and high hopes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s do this,&#34; I whispered to Ethan quickly with a Stern appearance, my heart pounding in my chest as if I got involved in a huge fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s do this,&#34; he whispered back, his eyes locked on mine with a huge smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judge banged his gavel hard on his table, and the court case began quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the judge called the court to order with my heart racing, I felt a sense of calm wash over me, which gave me hope and made my nervous system active.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew we had done everything we could to prepare for this day. Now it was time to see justice served in the right place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew&#39;s lawyer stood up, looking at mine with a rude face and a smug expression on his face that made me hate him quickly. .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Honor, my client is innocent of all charges laid against him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes arrogantly. That was literally expected from the lawyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia stood up, clearing her throat, her expression confident and serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Honor, we have evidence that proves Andrew&#39;s guilt of the charge. We request that the court take this evidence into consideration.&#34; Sophia said it with a serious and unfriendly look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judge nodded slowly, his expression serious as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well. Let&#39;s hear the evidence you have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, the court case began, making the tension thicker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was nervous but confident as Sophia presented our case to the judge. I knew we had done everything we could to prepare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it was time to see justice served to those who deserved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the court case continued with everyone&#39;s hearts racing, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of pride within. We had worked so hard to get to this point. And now, finally, we were seeing justice served to the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judge banged his gavel towards an ending, and the court case came to a close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a sense of relief wash over me as the judge read out the verdict, which was positive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew, you are hereby found guilty of all charges laid against you. You are sentenced to pay a fine and serve community service.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Sophia and Ethan, who were also as happy as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, feeling a sense of vindication within, but couldn&#39;t let it out. We had done it finally. We had finally seen justice served to the rival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we left the courtroom with Joy, Ethan turned to me happily, a huge grin on his face and excitement in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We did it, Mia. We actually did it. We actually had peace of mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled back at him, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We sure did, Ethan.&#34;</p>
