                <p>&#34;Why does your sister act so weird?&#34; As Ethan walked into my office, he threw the question up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why asking?&#34; I looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s your sister; why am I asking?&#34; He raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; She&#39;s my sister but she&#39;s so hidden to everyone,so I barely know much about her&#34; i said sticking my eyes back into the laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Mia,why don&#39;t we get them another place to stay instead of them staying with us ?&#34; He sat on my table with him looking at me while I just ignore his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That total is a waste of money when you have a big villa that is empty with absolutely no one there,&#34; I sighed, resting my back on the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan raised an eyebrow once more, clearly not satisfied with my former response to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not an answer, Mia. What&#39;s going on with your sister?&#34; He asked, his voice firm but totally gentle and calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, giving an exhale also, trying to brush him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, like seriously. My sister is totally fine.&#34; I tried to sound convincing, but I knew I wasn&#39;t fooling anyone here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ethan wasn&#39;t having it, still not believing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got up from the table and walked over to my chair slowly, spinning it around to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, I know something is going on. I&#39;ve seen the way she acts towards me, always hiding in her room, never wanting to talk to anyone but her phone and her mother. What&#39;s going on with her, Mia?&#34; He asked, his eyes searching mine for answers, but I truly don&#39;t know what to say to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to look away since I have no answer, but Ethan&#39;s eyes held mine quickly, refusing to let me escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I just couldn&#39;t keep it from him forever, but I wasn&#39;t ready to reveal the truth yet to him since we just got our own little peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, I... I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re really talking about,&#34; I stammered, trying to come up with an excuse to set myself free from his obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ethan wasn&#39;t having it at all. He leaned in closer, his face inches from mine, just to get an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, I know you&#39;re hiding something away from me. Tell me what&#39;s going on with your sister, and nothing bad can happen.&#34; He said with a smirk</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a huge surge of panic rise up within me. I didn&#39;t know what to say or how to get out of this situation already, but I just had to keep quiet in the meantime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, with thoughts going through my little brain, the phone rang, breaking the tension in the room and giving me some time to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s eyes quickly narrowed as he picked up the receiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; He said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just listened for a moment before his expression changed from curiosity to concern to pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? &#34; He stammered with anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll be right there now; please wait.&#34; He said as I felt a huge surge of panic within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung up the phone and turned to me quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was that?&#34; I curiously asked with goosebumps on my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was my dad&#39;s assistant calling.&#34; He said it with a serious look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He needs me to come to the mansion right away.&#34; Ethan said with the same expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow, wondering what was going on that caused the urgent call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34; I asked, feeling a sense of unease wash me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shook his head with a sigh also.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t actually know, but I have to go now to go check.&#34; He said adjusting his suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Will you come with me?&#34; He asked as I sat more comfortable on the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated for a few moment before nodding positively, giving him my answer..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I said, standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we go now?&#34; He asked as soon as I stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; I had to adjust my own dress and pick up my other items since I knew I wouldn&#39;t be back in the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we drove to the mansion area, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something was off and wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when we arrived at the huge mansion, I knew that my instincts had been right already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mansion was in a huge chaos, with people running around and shouting as if a protest was being held there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother was pacing back and forth in the living room, looking worried, keeping me in quick tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Ethan asked, rushing over to my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before my mother could answer, a loud noise echoed through the room, making us all turn around with anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that&#39;s when I saw her, standing in the doorway, a look of shock on her face , which also caused a shook to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amanda,&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like she had seen a ghost or a zombie, her eyes wide with fear and anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam Lucy, what&#39;s going on?&#34; Ethan asked, turning to my mother for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she just didn&#39;t know what to say. She was just as shocked as everyone else in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes of tension, everything went black before my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I came to, I was lying on the floor, Ethan&#39;s face hovering above me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, are you okay?&#34; He asked, his voice filled with concern and pity for me, who was also concerned about how I reached the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded slowly, still trying to process what had just happened to me and why I was lying on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I could say anything else, my sister appeared above me, her eyes still wide with fear and anxiety, just like before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, I...I have something to tell you,&#34; she stammered, keeping me in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before shecould say anything again to me, everything went black again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, I didn&#39;t know if I would ever wake up or if I would die afterwards.</p>
