                <p>&#34;Mia, have come here for my child and not here to come rant words with you,&#34; his face got filled with anger as he said his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s he talking about?&#34; Ethan asked me with laughter, and I gave an awkward chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew, what&#39;s wrong with you?&#34; I questioned aggressively, looking into the young male figure at my front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing is absolutely wrong with me; I just came here for my child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What child are you talking about here?&#34; Ethan stepped in with a hard question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing that started happening again just wasn&#39;t what I bargained for in my life much earlier; the always trouble, the always fight for one thing or the older just makes my life look like a roller coaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, knows what I am talking about?&#34; He smiled with evil within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know nothing, Andrew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you denying now, Mia?&#34; He laughed and dragged himself much closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not denying you, coward,&#34; I pushed him, adjusting back a little bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get into this house in the first place?&#34; My body got filled with boiling emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That shouldn&#39;t be a problem since I&#39;m here to take back my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What son are you talking about, young man?&#34; Ethan asked himself, revealing anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young man, when I am talking, please don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you to tell me to keep quiet until you are done talking?&#34; Ethan drew closer to Andrew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nevermind, young poor mister,&#34; Ethan said, folding his arms in anger as I pulled him from Andrew, whispering some words into his ears. &#34;His deadly&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew would possibly hear what I said since he laughed before taking his seat quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, I was once a poor young boy when Mia came to me.&#34; I interrupted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s our past, and that shouldn&#39;t be brought out here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who said so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do,&#34; he said, standing up, looking at me with evil within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood boldly to confront him. We both looked into each other&#39;s eyes with a deep frown, as if we were about to fight already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia!&#34; Andrew laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I get my child so I can leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I keep asking, whose child?&#34; Ethan asked with his phone quickly in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My child,&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You weren&#39;t the one who had sex with me that night, so why are you coming to claim someone else&#39;s child?&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, I&#39;m the one you loved, not him,&#34; I interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew, that love has already expired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why, Mia, why?&#34; He asked with a pitiful face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I was pregnant, I needed someone to rest my backs on, but you weren&#39;t there to help, but instead you ran away into a land that no one knows,&#34; he interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went out because of you and the baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, baby? You coward,&#34; my voice got filled with emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Ours&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut the fuck up! Andrew,&#34; I commanded, stepping closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are a good for nothing coward,&#34; I spat at him at that point, looking so mean and wicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air within the room was thick with tension as we stood there, our eyes locked in each other, adding a fierce stare-down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew&#39;s face was already twisted in a mixture of anger and desperation, while mine was set in a determined scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence was fully palpable, punctuated only by the sound of our heavy breathing and heart race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stood there also frozen, his phone still clutched in his hand, his eyes darting back and forth between us, but still up busy scrolling slowly with his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, sensing the tension in the room, began to whimper slowly, his small body trembling with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew took a few steps closer, his eyes blazing with fierce intensity at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, please,&#34; he begged, his voice low and husky, which was just like a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not leaving without my child.&#34; He said it with a frown and no cool tone anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, a cold and calm, mirthless sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your child? Which one of them?&#34; I spat, my voice dripping with venom and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You abandoned us, Andrew. You left me to deal with the consequences of your actions alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s action are you talking about, Mia?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you were rich enough, my mom would never have done what she did to me.&#34; My voice was firm and serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew&#39;s face contorted in pain, but he refused to back down. Still, he accomplished an impossible goal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I made mistakes earlier, Mia. But I&#39;m trying to make it right. Please, just give me my child and the love back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sneered at him, my heart hardening with every passing moment that came by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t deserve him, even if he was your son,&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not worthy of being a father or a boyfriend.&#34; My voice got filled with hatred for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew&#39;s eyes flashed with anger, but he didn&#39;t back down, still trying to pull my legs and those of Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to get my child back,&#34; he snarled, his voice low and menacing, filled with malice and deep evil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that word, he lunged at me, his arms outstretched to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood my ground, ready to defend myself and my child against this monster who dared to claim him, the monster who backed me down at a time when I needed him the most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as our bodies were about to collide against each other, the doorbell rang, shattering the tension in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who could that be?&#34; Ethan wondered aloud, his voice laced with concern and anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer; my eyes were still locked on Andrew&#39;s. The doorbell rang again, more insistent this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just couldn&#39;t concentrate on the doorbell, but I was very concerned about my son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That one of my guards maybe,&#34; Andrew laughed out loud, fixing himself in the spot of the villain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I forgot to tell you I am now rich,&#34; he adjusted with his laugh, but it wasn&#39;t a funny thing to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How many people did you kill to accomplish that?&#34; I questioned arrogantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t kill anyone, you animal.&#34; The door opened wide as a hefty man walked in with a bold, frowny, and Stern look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you walk into my home without a permit?&#34; I asked rudely, as the huge man just ignored my words as if I were just a low-life commoner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went close to the so-called boss and whispered a few words into his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kelvin!! Kelvin!!&#34; Ethan screeched out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have much time here anymore,&#34; Andrew said as the hefty man just stood behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who is so worried about that?&#34; I laughed out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But next time, when I come here for him,&#34; my son hugged my legs with fear, with Andrew pointing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just give him to me without much attack unless you all would ever regret it,&#34; he said, hissing as he looked at me nastly before he squatted, looking at the little boy whose fear had already filled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Son, I would always come here to fight for you,&#34; he smiled at Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cannot be my father,&#34; Alexander replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s call this a day, Mia,&#34; he said before he walked out of me and Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew is playing with the tail of a lion&#34; I laughed.</p>
