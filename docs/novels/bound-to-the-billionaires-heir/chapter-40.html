                <p>&#34;What&#39;s happening, Sophia?&#34; As soon as Ethan and I walked into the office filled with cool air, the question just made its way out of his hole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down,&#34; she said as she stood up quickly, her face filled with surprise at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sounded much as if something was wrong,&#34; Ethan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, something is more than wrong here, Mia, Ethan,&#34; she said, looking at us both with a weary face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you talk to us and keep us out of this suspense?&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Okay&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew sued Ethan for something that was strange and useless.&#34; This gave me a pale look quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew, whom I already started having pity for, had done more than he could possibly hold. Why would he sue Ethan this time? Why would he have to do something like that to Ethan? All because I choose Ethan over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, it&#39;s totally your fault,&#34; Ethan said, looking at me with a pale and weak voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know what to blame me for now?&#34; I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why won&#39;t I do so?&#34; His eyes were already pale red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia,&#34; he drew near to me, holding me by the arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If he sued me over you, do you know that I would be dead?&#34; The Thai statement made me laugh inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, what are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He sued me, Mia, all because of you.&#34; His voice had already started breaking up at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Firstly, we don&#39;t know his reasons for suing you, so we can&#39;t just judge,&#34; I said, and Ethan looked at Sophia at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He sued you for trying to muder and pose a pose a life threat.&#34; My eyes opened wide hearing this statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For real,&#34; Ethan asked with anger already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With what Sophia already said, I just felt like I had been punched in the gut, or rather stabbed in between my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Murder and life threats? That&#39;s absurd!&#34; I exclaimed, my voice shaking with disbelief already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s face turned red, filledwith boiling anger, his eyes blazing with fury, and he was breathing so fast as if he were going through a hot race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can he even sue me for that? I&#39;ve never even raised a hand to him, nor had I tried hurting him!&#34; He thundered, his voice scattering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded vigorously , her expression incredulous and pity within it . But another thing that just hold me up in my head, how could she know about that when it hasn&#39;t been long I came home from Andrew place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This just made me think unstop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, right? It&#39;s like he&#39;s trying to frame you or something. This is ridiculous and very bad!&#34; Sophia said with a calm tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, trying to process the information in my head, trying to get things right at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is all because of me, isn&#39;t it? Andrew&#39;s trying to get back at me for choosing Ethan over him.&#34; I felt a wave of guilt wash over me, threatening to engulf me,I felt through my vein and regret already. Me knowing am putting someone into a huge issue just makes me really sad .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s expression turned grim, his jaw clenched in anger, grinning his teeth with a huge pace of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid so, Mia. He&#39;s trying to destroy me, and he&#39;s using you as a pawn in his game to bring me down. But we&#39;re not going to let him get away with it. I promise to pay him back in a way that would hurt him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a surge of determination within me, my mind racing with thoughts of how to fight back at Andrew. But beneath that, I couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling of responsibility of keeping someone in big danger. I had never meant for things to escalate this far or never had I expected Andrew to come back trying to claim me as his ex lover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few discussions with Sophia over the whole issue, myself and Ethan just had to leave the office to help Sophia prepare for how to save Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we both left the office, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what other tricks Andrew had up his sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he going to stop at nothing to destroy Ethan just to get me back as his bride? The thought sent a shiver down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got home, I went straight to my mother&#39;s room, Madam Lucy, and told her everything that was happening in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She listened attentively, her expression growing more and more concerned, showing pity for every pace of my statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, you have to be really careful,&#34; she said, her voice laced with worry and a huge sigh of pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew&#39;s not a person to be trifled with. He&#39;s dangerous; he&#39;s cruel and heartless.&#34; She groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, feeling a sense of fear creeping up my spine with my mother&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. &#34;I know, Mother. But what can I do? He&#39;s already sued Ethan, and I don&#39;t know what else he&#39;s capable of doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Amanda walked into the room with her eyes stuck into her phone, a look of determination on her face as she raised it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly raised her head and gave a quick glance at myself and my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Mia. I&#39;ll defend you and Ethan against Andrew&#39;s accusations. We&#39;ll get through this together as a family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately stood up after her short phrase to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, I don&#39;t need you both in this matter; you both have done enough already,&#34; I said to them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean, Mia?&#34; My mom asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, you are the main reason why all this is happening now.&#34; I just couldn&#39;t hide my words from me already, so I had to spit them out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, why would you blame Mother?&#34; Amanda asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adam, watch your tongue, since you know you are in my house,&#34; I hissed before I walked closer to the door just to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A house that you never wanted to be in,&#34; Amanda said rudely.</p>
