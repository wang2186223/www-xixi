                <p>&#34;Where is she?&#34; As soon as I made my way into my father&#39;s room, where he lays with hard sickness,.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean, father?&#34; I questioned as I walked closer to him, sitting on the right side of him since he lay with weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan,&#34; he breathed hard, calling up my name, which I just looked at him with a sigh of pity within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father,&#34; I gave a short response, looking at him with a deep feeling of pain within me since he has been in that condition for a few months with all medical attention going well like a huge breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Do you want me died?&#34; His question cause a chill down my spine immediately. Why would he be asking such questions? &#34; I gazed at him with a kind of care free look but still thinking it what I would come up with to tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Father, why would I?&#34; I replied with another question attaching to it as I try to sound calm and reassuring, still glancing at him as he labors hard to give a well-sounding breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father&#39;s eyes reached into mine at that point, . I looked at him with both mixed feelings of both sadness and a little bit of frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Ethan.&#34; He called up my name with a cough as I looked at him quickly. &#34;Please do anything you can to bring her back, because she has your first seed with her,&#34; my father concluded his word with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed to him with a deep breath, feeling a sense of sadness wash over me at that point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father, we&#39;ve been over this. &#34; I said before my father interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We haven&#39;t, son!&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, you just accept Mia is gone and she left us, and I need to move on with my life the same way you need to also move on,&#34; I said with a harsh voice to my father, who managed to try looking at me by sitting upright with my own support and that of the pillows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my father&#39;s gaze was just so deep at me, which made me look in another direction of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t understand, Ethan.&#34; He sniffled as I looked back in his direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WWhat do you mean by I don&#39;t understand?&#34; I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She needs your help.&#34; He gave a reply with his calm voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow, giving a more carefree look this time around with a slient hiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father, you&#39;re not making any sense. You&#39;re sick, and you need to rest.&#34; I said to him, trying back to bed, rid him at point since his words were no longer sounding interesting to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my father&#39;s grip on my arm tightened, still not letting me to bed rid him. I looked at him with me losing with no relief within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen to me, Ethan.&#34; He paused with another sniff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must find her and the baby and protect them,&#34; my father said to me, adding to his own word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a surge of guilt and anxiety within my inner mind, reeling with the implications. My father&#39;s words stirred up some negative feelings, feelings I thought I had long thrown away into somewhere I couldn&#39;t find.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole memories of Mia&#39;s and what I did to her just keep on rolling through my own head at that point. I felt the pain and betrayal that she would be facing, and the threat just kept deep within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father, please,&#34; I said, my voice softening and much calmer this time as I held on my father&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. &#34;You&#39;re not well. You need to rest and recover. We can talk about this later.&#34; I said as I successfully laid him back on the bed with me standing up at that point just to walk out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my father&#39;s eyes flashed with a fierce determination, and his hand held on mine tight and not having any way to release mine, and this made me look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Ethan. There is no later. Time is running out. You must find her now, before it&#39;s too late.&#34; My father&#39;s words still just sounded good to me. Me getting someone who I just couldn&#39;t stay with, since I still felt the guilt within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a shiver run down my spine as I gazed into his eyes, seeing the desperation and fear lurking in their depths. My mind raced with questions after questions, but I knew I had to tread carefully. My father&#39;s health was fragile, and I didn&#39;t want to push him too hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling that he was hiding something, that there was more to this story than he was letting on. I decided to probe further to see if I could uncover the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father,&#34; I said, my voice soft and gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean by all this you have been telling me? What do you really want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father&#39;s eyes closed, his chest rising and falling in slow, labored breaths. For a moment, I thought he had drifted off to sleep, but then his eyes snapped open, and he fixed me with a piercing gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen myself in the land of the died if you didn&#39;t bring Mia back, &#34; with his chest rising up and keeping me in deep fear he called up my name once more &#34;Ethan,&#34; he whispered, his voice barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Father&#39;s , what&#39;s going on?&#34; I asked with fear and confusion not knowing what i should possibly do next at that time. My gear being racing so quickly at that point as if it wanted to pull out of it space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Do anything within you to bring that lady back with my grandchild&#34; he still said with a voice that was much more lower than a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a surge of confusion, my mind reeling with the implications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I could ask any more questions, my father&#39;s eyes closed, and his body went limp. I felt a surge of panic, my heart racing with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father!&#34; I shouted, shaking him gently. &#34;Father, wake up!&#34; My eyes immediately felt so wet .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t respond. I felt a cold dread creeping up my spine, a sense of foreboding that I couldn&#39;t shake off. I knew I had to find Mia, no matter what it took. My father&#39;s life depended on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Father,&#34; I screeched out so loud which quickly invited the attention of the other workers within the apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes being so wet and already with maid&#39;s and guard around myself and my father who laid there like an ice fish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Hey, do what I want&#34; this word caused a deep laughter which kept me surprise.</p>
