                <p>I was filled with anxiety and a nervous spirit as I walked into the office of the young lawyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Ethan,&#34; the young lady gave Ethan a hug as if they were besties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is she?&#34; Her voice was like a whisper, but I could still drag out her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s Mia and my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, you are married,&#34; the young lady laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop acting childish.&#34; Within me, the character they both possess just acted childish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, beautiful lady Mia,&#34; the young lady said, looking at me with her hands stretched towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,&#34; I smiled, accepting the smooth hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here,&#34; she said, stretching her hands for a hug, which I accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a few seconds, the hug was over, and the happiness in the room just made everywhere lively and interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young lawyer, whose name was Sophia, had a very generous spirit toward us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat down in one of the chairs in front of her desk, with Ethan sitting beside me. Sophia sat down behind her desk and smiled at us, which we both smiled back at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So for main business,&#34; she said, gazing at us both without a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, Ethan, what can I do for you?&#34; she asked, her eyes sparkling with interest and thoughtfulness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath within and launched into the story of Andrew&#39;s betrayal and his claims of wanting to be a part of our child&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia listened closely, her expression growing more and more serious as I spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finished with all the words, Sophia nodded thoughtfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; she said with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then, first of all, let me tell you that you have every right to be concerned about Andrew&#39;s intentions towards you.&#34; She immediately picked up a piece of paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His behavior towards you has been unacceptable, and it&#39;s clear that he has no regard for your well-being.&#34; She said it with a low smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, dear,&#34; I said, feeling a sense of relief wash over me all due to her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia smiled. &#34;Not at all. Now, let&#39;s talk about what we can do to protect your child and yourself. But have you considered getting a restraining order against Andrew?&#34; She questioned me like a police detective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded slightly. &#34;Yes, I have been thinking about that since yesterday, but I still don&#39;t know if it&#39;s enough to make him stay away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A restraining order could possibly be a good start, but it may not be enough to keep Andrew away from your child. We may need to take further action to ensure your child&#39;s safety plus yours,&#34; Sophia nodded, saying her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of action do you mean, Sophia?&#34; Ethan finally spoke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia leaned forward, looking at her best friend from eyeball to eyeball.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, we could just consider filing for full custody of the child, with supervised visitation for Andrew. That way, you can ensure that your child is safe and that Andrew is not able to harm him or you.&#34; Sophia leaned back to the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words just provided hope for me at that point. &#34;That sounds like a really good idea,&#34; I said with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded with her own smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s a great idea. And don&#39;t worry; I&#39;ll be with you every step of the way. We&#39;ll work together to make sure that your child is protected and that Andrew is held accountable for his actions and his coming to claim something that isn&#39;t his.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a deep sense of gratitude towards Sophia, and I knew that I had made the right decision by coming to meet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her words and support, I knew that I could face whatever challenges lay ahead and ensure that myself and my child were safe and happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we both left Sophia&#39;s office, I felt a sense of hope and trust that I had not felt in a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that the road ahead would not be easy, but I was already ready to face it head-on, with Sophia and Ethan by my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Wait.&#34;&#34;As myself and Ethan were about to leave the office area, I felt that I had forgotten something in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What?&#34; Ethan asked as I opened up my bag to confirm if I actually left something in her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My phone.&#34; I still just opened my bag, searching every single space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it is in the Sophia office,&#34; I said, looking up at Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned back and headed up to her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, wassup?&#34; As I opened the door, she quickly asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I forgot my phone here,&#34; she quickly said, opening the little cupboard beside her and bringing out a phone that looked just like mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks a lot.&#34; I felt relieved already with her helping to spot my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to call Ethan,&#34; she said, stretching her hands toward me with the phone, which I accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I smiled to get my phone buzz as soon as it was already in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is my mother calling me?&#34; I looked in the direction of Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pick it up; maybe it&#39;s something important,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Sophia added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia,&#34; my name, was called from the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; &#34;Mother, what&#39; happening?&#34;&#34;My mother&#39;s voice immediately got filled with fear, which made her stammer in her sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Alexander,&#34; she said, giving me quick fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong with him?&#34; My heart started to race quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has been kidnapped.&#34;</p>
