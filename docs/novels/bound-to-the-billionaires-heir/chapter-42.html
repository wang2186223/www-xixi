                <p>&#34;Sophia, myself, and Ethan had finally had some thought and decided to avenge,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you want to do that when your court case is just next week?&#34; Sophia replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So quick?&#34; Ethan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Sophia replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you both have to think of something that could happen before the day,&#34; Sophia added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I said, taking a quick gulp down my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We want to sue him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room felt so slient after my words to Sophia; she just couldn&#39;t take her eyes off me, as if she had a crush on me. I looked at her with curiosity at this point and also gave her awkward chuckles just to make her look away, but still the tension was on the high side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Sophia!&#34; I said calmly, just to snap her off the basic thinking aspect she had already engaged herself in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just trying to examine you for a while,&#34; she continued her serious look while Ethan just laughed, and I looked to his own side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s funny?&#34; My question immediately helped to seize his laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, we can&#39;t sue him when we already sued Ethan,&#34; she exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know he sued Ethan.&#34; I drew myself closer to her, giving her the same look she once gave me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to sue him on the same day he wants to sue Ethan,&#34; she interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ohh,&#34; she paused briefly while I smirked at her. &#34;Woah, good plan, but,&#34; I interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is there a but there?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, but we have just a week for that, and we need evidence for any case before I can go ahead and sue him,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think that can&#39;t be an issue,&#34; Ethan hoped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>,******</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have plenty of evidence against Andrew. We can use the recordings of him threatening us and the documents he&#39;s been sending us from time to time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; I said, nodding in agreement with Ethan&#39;s word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And we can also use the fact that he&#39;s been harassing us online. That&#39;s definitely not acceptable behavior for top figures like we both.&#34; I looked to Ethan, who also nodded to my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia nodded, her expression serious and Stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree. We have a strong case against him already. But we need to make sure we have all our ducks in a row before we go to court for the main case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I quite understand,&#34; I said. &#34;So what&#39;s the main plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,&#34; Sophia started still with her serious look, &#34;first we need to gather all our evidence and organize it accordingly. Then we need to file the lawsuit and serve Andrew with the papers so he could meet us in court.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I said, taking a deep breath within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds like a lot of work for us all. But I&#39;m willing to do whatever it takes to make sure Andrew pays for what he&#39;s done to me and my Ethan, plus putting my child&#39;s life in huge danger.&#34; I exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan nodded in agreement with my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too. Let&#39;s do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all spent the rest of the day gathering evidence and organizing our case for the better..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia was a huge help to us, and I was grateful for her expertise in her career.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we worked tiredlessly, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of excitement within me. We were finally taking action against Andrew and his wickedness, and I knew we were going to win him on this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the day wore on, I started to feel a sense of unease once more. What if Andrew just didn&#39;t take the lawsuit seriously? What if he tried to retaliate against us? What if we lose?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried, pushed the thoughts aside, and focused on the task at hand. We were going to win this case, and Andrew was going to pay for what he&#39;d done to me and my new family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, after hours of work and unrest, we were ready to file the lawsuit against Andrew. Sophia gave us a nod of approval, and we headed to the courthouse without waste of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we walked in with me taking a deep breath, I felt a sense of determination within. We were doing this. We were taking a stand against Andrew and his bullying ways towards our lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We approached the front desk and began the process of filing the lawsuit against our rival. The clerk looked at us with a sympathetic expression after going through our report, and I could tell she was on our side already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good luck with your court case,&#34; she said as she handed us the paperwork with a bold smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, Deae,&#34; I said, smiling back at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going to need it.&#34; I added</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we left the courthouse with high hopes, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. We had done it once. We had taken the first step towards bringing Andrew to justice and making us have peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as we walked back to the car, I couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling of unease within, with questions running through my head unstop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would Andrew do next?&#34; I asked myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would he try to retaliate against us?&#34; The questions couldn&#39;t just stop running through my head, the questions hitting against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the present moment and the fact and the fact that we have made a step forward in bringing down Andrew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had done something important today, and I was proud of us for taking a stand for our own lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we drove home, Ethan turned to me with a serious expression and face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, we need to be really careful. Andrew&#39;s not going to take this lying down.&#34; Ethan&#39;s eyes were fixed on the road, as he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know Ethan,&#34; I said, my heart racing unstop as if I were judging myself against what I just did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we&#39;re in this together. We&#39;ll face whatever comes our way as  a couple.&#34; I smiled at the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan nodded positively, his eyes locked on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Together, as family,&#34; he said.</p>
