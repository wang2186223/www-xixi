                <p>&#34;I hope you already submitted the court case to Andrew.&#34; Ethan walked into the room with his phone in the middle of his shoulder and ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s appearance was not like what I have seen in a long time; he wore his office dress, which was top-notch on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked closer to him, giving him a peck while I went to get my hair wax to apply to my hair before myself and him went to do our normal work as office workers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; he said as soon as he dropped the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, do you in any way see my tie?&#34; He asked slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really, but I saw Alexander walk in earlier; maybe he took it,&#34; Ethan smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Thanks&#34; he walked out quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon I was already done, so I picked up his phone and went straight to meet him at Alex&#39;s room.</p>

                <p>&#34;But mommy, I want to play with Daddy,&#34; Alex said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are going to work late, young man.&#34; Ethan immediately came closer to me when I ignored Alexander, who gave a fragile look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; But....&#34; I interrupted Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, you can play with Amanda or Grandma,&#34; I smiled at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are mean,&#34; I exhaled with a little smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just didn&#39;t go ahead and say anything to him, but I just dragged Ethan by the arm down the stairs to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Mia.&#34;&#34;He tried restricting his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes, you must learn how to say no to that boy.&#34; I stopped into the car as the driver locked the door quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we arrived at work with positivity and settled into our office with high hopes, Andrew burst in again to ruin the day like he normally does, his face red with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, instead of meeting his anger with our own like before, we just decided to take a different approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew, what&#39;s going on?&#34; I asked calmly, trying to understand the source of his frustration and early morning madness in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know exactly what&#39;s going on, Mia,&#34; Andrew snapped, his voice dripping with hostility and deep malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t know,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sued me; that&#39;s what&#39;s going on here, Mia!&#34; He exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand why you&#39;re upset, Andrew.&#34; Ethan intervened with his crazy chuckle, and after a while, his voice was soothing and calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But maybe we can talk about this like adults, rather than toddlers.&#34; Let&#39;s try to understand each other&#39;s perspectives and anger.&#34; Ethan said it with a serious look and little to no anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew sneered, his expression twisted in disdain and the rage of raging anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Adults? You want to talk about this like adults? You&#39;re the ones who sued me, remember? You&#39;re the ones who are trying to ruin my reputation, my business, and my career.&#34; I just gave him a frown this time, with no words to interrupt his whole question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, Andrew,&#34; I said gently, trying to placate him so he understood what Ethan was trying to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we had our reasons, just as you also had yours. You were harassing us without number, and we felt like we had no choice but to do what was best. We tried to talk to you about it, but you wouldn&#39;t listen, so we then did what we had to do.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew&#39;s voice rose again, his anger boiling over everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harassing you? I was just trying to get your attention, Mia. I didn&#39;t mean to scare you or anything. You&#39;re being too sensitive with your life.&#34; He exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s voice remained firm but calm, a stark contrast to Andrew&#39;s escalating anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever your intentions were, Andrew, your actions were unacceptable to us. And that&#39;s why we sued you. We had to protect ourselves and our business.&#34; Ethan hoped in with a calm voice towards him while you laughed within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrew&#39;s eyes flashed with anger once more, and he took a step closer to us with his teeth grinning and his fists clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to regret this, Mia,&#34; he growled, his voice low and menacing, filled with malice and hate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to regret suing me. I&#39;ll make sure of it.&#34; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a shiver run down my spine at this point, but I stood my ground, not letting him intimidate me or refusing to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew, I don&#39;t think you understand the situation,&#34; I said reasonably, trying to calm him down, but he still just behaves like a supreme that no one can bring down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understand what?&#34; He exclaimed with a high voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew, this is an office area, and it needs to be calm and free from noise,&#34; I said, taking a deep breath and holding my already-developing anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who cares?&#34; He hissed and spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew, please don&#39;t let me call the security on you,&#34; Ethan said to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan Joshua and Mia Joshua, you both should stay clear from me and bring down that case now,&#34; he commanded as soon as he turned around, walking towards the door to the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First, bring down ours, then we shall bring yours down,&#34; I said with my own voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if I didn&#39;t bring yours down, what&#39;s going to happen?&#34; He turned back, coming closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made a few steps, getting closer to him, with our eyes piercing into each other with mean looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you have to dance to the music that will be played for you,&#34; I groaned and spat at him before I made a few steps backwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mia, you are so little for what I do.&#34; He said this to me with his annoying groan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who cares?&#34; I hissed at my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Security,&#34; the two men behind me, walked up to Andrew with their mean faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take him out of this firm.&#34; &#34;NNow!&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they held his arms, I just made them stop and walk closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One mistake you made as a human was to try to harm me and take away my peace.&#34; I said... &#34;Now, you have just started the real fight, and I promise it won&#39;t end well.&#34;.</p>
