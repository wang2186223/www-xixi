                <p>After the court case between the whole family and the victory, I just couldn&#39;t take away the happiness within myself. I just can&#39;t wash away the large anxiety within me and over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, Mia, I am so proud of you,&#34; my mom said, giving me a hug quickly with a bold smile.</p>

                <p>The hug lasted for a few seconds before we both just had to separate with a bold smile on everyone&#39;s face.</p>

                <p>At that point i couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment wash me . We had done it. We had finally seen justice served.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mom came over to me with a bold smile and a huge smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, Mia, I&#39;m so proud of you,&#34; she said, giving me a tight hug that was so warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hugged her back tightly, feeling so happy and feeling a sense of relief wash over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We would have our own peace for now,&#34; I said, smiling with happiness within my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hug lasted for a few seconds before we separated afterwards, both of us still grinning from ear to ear with a smirk that just couldn&#39;t fade out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan came over to us happily, a huge smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This calls for a victory party!&#34; he exclaimed, his eyes shining with excitement and gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed happily, feeling a sense of joy that I hadn&#39;t felt in a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Definitely,&#34; I said, nodding in agreement with what Ethan said in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all decided to go to a nearby restaurant to celebrate our win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we walked in, the hostess greeted us with a bold smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations on your victory!&#34; she said, leading us to a table that could contain us all as a family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We ordered our food and drinks, and as we waited for them to arrive, we chatted and laughed, still on a high from the court case that happened much earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the food arrived, we dug in and chatted with each other, savoring the delicious flavors of the nice food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a huge smile on my face as I looked around the table at my loved ones enjoying themselves, but Amanda&#39;s smile just faded for a while and came back, but I just didn&#39;t take that to heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We talked and laughed some more as a family, enjoying each other&#39;s company and words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a much-needed celebration after all the stress and anxiety of the court case and our win over the main rival of our lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we finished up and prepared to leave, Ethan raised his glass of exculsive wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To justice being served!&#34; he toasted to it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all clinked our glasses together and took a sip, smiling at each other, which finally turned into huge laughter among us all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we all left the restaurant, I felt a sense of peace wash over me this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had done it finally. We had finally seen justice served to whom it belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as we walked away from the restaurant with smiles, arm in arm, I knew that we would always have each other&#39;s backs at this rough point, no matter what happened to any of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party continued at home with no stop of enjoyment, with music and dancing and plenty of food and drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a night to remember, a night to celebrate our victory and our love for each other, a night to show love to each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night went on, we took photos and made memories that would last a lifetime in our eyes and hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a night that I would always treasure forever, a night that would stay with me forever and never be forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as I looked around at my loved ones who were happy, I knew that we would always have each other, no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had been through so much together as a new family, and we had come out stronger on the other side by just sharing quite the love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party went late into the night, but I didn&#39;t want it to end. I was having so much fun, too much joy, and too much happiness that I even forgot about my past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But eventually, we can&#39;t cheat nature, so it was time to say goodnight to each other. We hugged each other tightly, still grinning from ear to ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for this night,&#34; I said, my voice filled with emotion and my face filled with a bold smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anytime,&#34; Ethan replied, smiling back at me. &#34;We deserve it after all we&#39;ve been through just to gain peace.&#34; He kept his expression neutral with his smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, we went to bed, our hearts full of joy and our spirits lifted. We had done it. We had finally seen justice served, but as my head lay on the pillows, I could feel Ethan up already, and this made me look towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I questioned sitting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my father,&#34; his face look just changed immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about him?&#34; I asked, drawing myself closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His sickness is just wearing me out.&#34; I placed my palm on his chest area, which made him look at me before going ahead to continue his statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Things would be okay, Ethan,&#34; I said with a pity-filled voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He should be part of us celebrating our victory,&#34; he exclaimed, sniffing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, everything would be okay, I promise, I said to him while he just looked at me as if she wanted to cry already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go to sleep.&#34; After a peck on his cheek, we both placed our heads on the pillows and went to sleep, not planning for the next day nor thinking about what might be up for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.</p>
