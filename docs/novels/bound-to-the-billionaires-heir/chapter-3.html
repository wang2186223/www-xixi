                <p>Mia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you crying over a simple sexual encounter?&#34; I immediately started to doubt my sister because of the way she expressed herself. She accepted it as a typical occurrence that occurs to women nearly every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked her right away, &#34;What are you talking about, Amanda?&#34; as she picked up the phone and gave me a sour look that was accentuated by a hiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to face my mother, but she did not show any overt signs of sympathy or even sadness. She just regarded me with this unassuming expression, as though nothing horrible had also occurred or the incident had been a typical, predetermined event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears were streaming from my eyes as I called up to Mom. Even though I was in excruciating pain, my mother ignored my urgent calls for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother!&#34; I screamed as my vein became visible through my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She shot me a quick, glaring glance while screeching at me. I glanced with surprise and contemplation at my mother and sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on the sitting room door caught my attention while I was still staring at my mother and sister. I instantly wiped away tears to give it a dry appearance and added a phony smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called out, &#34;Come in,&#34; and a moment later a man entered the sitting room dressed in a black suit and exuded a sense of great wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, the entire sitting room filled with the scent of the attractive man&#39;s dress. My sister and mother had already stood when he entered the room, but I got up as soon as he got closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello ma&#39;am,&#34; he said, giving my mother a simple handshake that she accepted with a broad smile on her face. I also had a fake smile applied to my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My suspicions about what was going on were sparked by my mother and sister&#39;s persistent smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came from Sir Joshua,&#34; he said, instantly bending slightly to acknowledge everyone present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I instantly rolled up my eyes and said to myself, &#34;He is just a maid,&#34; while continuing to look at him as though we still had an unresolved disagreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not find it problematic that my mom and sister left the sitting room with the guy right away, leaving me alone. I sat down on the cushion in silence, remembering what had happened to me, but this time my face was much dryer and I was reacting palely. As the pain intensified, though, I let out a loud cry and struck my arm and hand on the cushion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My life has significantly become more difficult than I had anticipated,&#34; I said to myself as tears streamed out of my eyes. Despite all my attempts, my heart had already been broken and had fallen to the ground. There was no way to put it back together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I heard foot steps approaching the sitting room from outside the sitting room , I immediately cleaned up my eyes as if nothing happened. It was my mom and sister that Walked in with laughter on there face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What the happiness for?&#34; I asked them as they both sat on the cushion at almost same time . .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; It nothing&#34; my mother exclaimed wearing an immediate frown at once</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Mom,&#34; Amanda called out my mom name rudely. As my mom heard her name from Amanda she immediately looked at her and used her eye lashes to bath her up . &#34; You have to tell ,Mia that she has no full right in this house again&#34; As Amanda said those words in a rude manner , my head immediately sparked up with lot of anger already in me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What the meaning of that? And what are you both not telling me ?&#34; I yelled as soon as my stood up girl looking at both my mom and sister at same time . As my heart already started hitting so fast than I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mom and sister just looked at each other with a surprise look. At first, I was a calm person who they use to play around like a little child in the family, but my reaction to them was like a strong attack to them both. There&#39;s looked at each other as if they communicate with there eyes .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Calm down&#34; my mom stood up after the long look to get daughter, Amanda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Calm down for what?&#34; I spoke with lot of anger within my words , with also grinning my teeth together with annoyance .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What we you both not telling me ? Mom!&#34; I asked also screeching out my mother&#39;s name .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; No, one yells at madam Lucy&#34; she immediately used a slap to shut me up , which also made me look at her in more anger and a more pale face .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Sit down and listen&#34; my mom said as tears came out of my eyes gradually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; You are bethored already to Ethan Joshua &#34; my mom words were immediately cut short with that of my little sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; One of the richest and influencer in the entire world&#34; As my sister said this words tears came out uncontrollably , with my eyes turning pale red immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What are you both saying?&#34; I asked with a much confused look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; You heard us right , you are already married , so you just have to do few things, which are &#34; my mom paused as soon as Amanda walked closer to her .&#34; Break up with Andrew&#34; .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I can&#39;t do so mother&#34; I immediately stood up to the words of my mother with anger in me ..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; First of all return all money you collected from who ever it is and have it in mind I can&#39;t marry who I don&#39;t love, if it isn&#39;t Andrew then it no one&#34; my mom and sister just looked at me without any words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Excuse me&#34; I pushed my mom away form her standing position and walked out with a strong hiss to her .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; She must be mad &#34; I gave a pause to exist and turned around looking at my sister who made the statement to me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; You are the mad person here, you foster child&#34; I said and walked out of the two presence.</p>
