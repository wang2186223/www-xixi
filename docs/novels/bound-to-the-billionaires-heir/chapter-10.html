                <p>As I moved into my new space, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of relief wash over me and my new world plus that of my son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had finally escaped the toxic environment of my family&#39;s home and from the ones that hated me and played as if they loved me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And at this point of my new life I was determined to make a new life for myself and my baby, who barely knows anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as I lay there in the darkness of the hotel room, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that I was being watched by someone since I left my parents house much earlier that evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes to find a figure standing in the shadows, a feminine figure which stood glancing at me while hiding in the shadows of my door, with the eyes fixed on me with an unnerving intensity. I was immediately shocked with seeing someone already In the room, with my baby beside me I dragged him closer to me with a surprise look to the female figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart raced with fear as I sat up, my hand instinctively already on my baby tightly. But as the figure stepped forward, I saw that it was a woman, her face kind and gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Seems like my plans didn&#39;t work&#34; I Said to myself looking at her own direction as she drew closer .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I asked, my voice barely a whisper to the person as I stood up from the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; I&#39;m Sarah,&#34; she replied, her voice soft and soothing as I adjusted back a little bit .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been watching you for a while now, Mia. I know what you&#39;re going through.&#34; As she said those words my heart skipped with fragile fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Who sent you? How did you get me?&#34; I questioned with dear gripping so tight in me with much of a fragile look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a surge of fear and anxiety, wondering how this stranger knew my name and followed me to my hotel room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want from me?&#34; I asked with a deep tune as my baby just yawn, my hand still wrapped protectively around my baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to help you,&#34; Sarah replied, her eyes filled with compassion and pity to me but I just ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Excuse me&#34; I said to her carrying my baby on very well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what it&#39;s like to be trapped in a situation like yours and still have to fight for your right and hope&#34; I gave a glimpse on her with positive hope that maybe she was really ready to help me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked closer to her as she continued her word&#34; But I also know that there&#39;s a way out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a glimmer of hope, and I leaned forward, my heart pounding in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me,&#34; I said, my voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, Sarah began to speak, her words painting a picture of a world beyond my wildest dreams. A world where I was free, where I was safe, and where my baby and I could live without fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I listened, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders, and I knew that I had found a true ally in Sarah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; So , how did you Know much about me ?&#34; I asked her with sitting in a much comfortable manner this time around with feelings that were much positive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; As I said earlier have been following you for a while now, so I know must things about you&#34; I gave a gentle smile to her as we both chatted for some mean time before she then looked up to my baby side Making her to reach him up to him with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Hello handsome&#34; I smirked to both my baby and the lady who tried to grab him at that point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How my baby accepted the embrace from her made me believe she was real. My child was much like someone who doesn&#39;t let people carry him apart from myself and his grandma . But him accepting her with no double thinking just made me knew something was totally different about this woman and she has a positive sprit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What&#39;s is name?&#34; She asked playing joyfully with my baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Ohh,&#34; I paused &#34; Alexander&#34; I replied as I heard a loud grunt from my stomach at that point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Nice name&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Thanks,&#34; .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; How have you been with you caring for this baby all alone with no help from anyone?&#34; She asked as I wore a frown with her asking the question at that point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been managing though,&#34; I replied, my voice laced with a hint of struggle and pain. &#34;It&#39;s hasn&#39;t been easy, &#34; I paused giving a relieve. &#34;but I&#39;m doing my best to provide for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah nodded sympathetically with a gaze to me that has pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can imagine the stress and how It&#39;s not easy being a single mother, especially when you&#39;re running from a dangerous situation. But you&#39;re doing great, Mia. You&#39;re strong and capable, and Alexander is lucky to have you as his mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a warmth in my heart at her words, and I smiled slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, Sarah. That means a lot coming from you.&#34; I smirked to her words since she already started giving me comfort when there wasn&#39;t any.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah smiled back at me. &#34;I mean it, Mia. And I want you to know that I&#39;m here for you, both of you. &#34; She placed her arms on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to help you in any way I can, whether it&#39;s with Alexander or with getting back on your feet.&#34; She said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately felt hope within my inner self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Sarah. &#34; I smirked giving a little pause . &#34;Your words means so much to me.&#34; I gave a calm voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we hugged each other warmly.  I felt a sense of relief wash over me and hope. I knew that I had found a true friend in Sarah, someone who would be there for me and Alexander no matter what. And with her help, I knew that we would be able to face whatever came our way, together.</p>
