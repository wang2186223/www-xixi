                <p>Mia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah,&#34; I called up with a well-dressed and attractive one. I called up her name so gently because she just laid down on the bed so calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised up her head and sat more comfortable with a look that looked so dramatic while I adjusted my skirt with a smile looking up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s my dress?&#34; I asked myself with a cool and simple smile at that point in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going to so dressed?&#34; She asked gently, with her glancing at me from up till down as if my dress was literally just bad to her and wasn&#39;t fit to go out for a job interview.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I told you.&#34; She stood up at that point as she drew closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Told me what?&#34; She questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Going for a business interview as a secretary,&#34; I smiled to her as she gave an immediate chuckle to me as if I wasn&#39;t that fit at all for the job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked to her with no longer a smile and a slight frown, since her words sounded so discouraging to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Sarah pulled out her phone, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a strike of quick excitement and gratitude towards her, still looking closer at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been supportive of me since when we both knew, and her belief in me meant a lot, but sometimes she just behaved so badly, which made me curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, why this kind of reaction?&#34; I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah smiled warmly and handed me her phone with the job listing open on the screen. &#34;You&#39;re welcome, Kate. I know you&#39;ll crush this interview and get the job. You&#39;re perfect for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does this mean?&#34; I asked strolling through the thick screen, which had a document that involved different working spaces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With me still gazing at the large sum of salary and other benefits there, my head was so washed with greed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held the phone with little sigh of greed and began to read through the job description, my excitement growing with each passing sentence. It was like the job was tailor-made for me, and I couldn&#39;t wait to apply and show them what I was capable of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I read, I sat down quickly on the bed as time passed by slowly. Soon,  Sarah sat down next to me on the bed, her eyes fixed on me with a supportive gaze, and her phone I held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what do you think?&#34; She asked with a kind of tune that was breaking down slowly, and I just looked at her with a simple smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are you going to apply?&#34; She asked, her voice filled with encouragement and shyness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded eagerly, my mind already racing with ideas and strategies for the interview.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Definitely,&#34; I said, my voice filled with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why won&#39;t I accept such jobs, but...&#34; I turned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what?&#34; She asked with a firm voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the company name?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elite,&#34; I looked at her with a facial squirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds familiar,&#34; I said with a gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah grinned with a deep look into my eyes. &#34;It&#39;s a popular company, young lady,&#34; Sarah said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I think I would just cancel this one and apply for this since the benefits are definitely awesome,&#34; I exclaimed with a feel of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the spirit, Kate! I know you&#39;ll do great things.&#34; Sarah smirked at my words quickly as I also chuckled at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon my baby just distracted with his own words, making me look at him with a better smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her support and encouragement, I felt a sense of confidence and determination that I hadn&#39;t felt in a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that I was capable of achieving my dreams, and with Sarah by my side, I felt unstoppable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon I prepared my own footstep to walk out of the hotel room. I walked into the girl with a deep breath within me. I was offered a form to fill for the job position I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I began to apply for the job, a young lady sat with me, offering her advice and support every step of the way. We bothspent the next few hours perfecting my resume and cover letter and practicing my interview skills until I felt like a pro.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I hit the submit button and sent in my application. I let out a sigh of relief and turned to Sarah with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for your help, young lady,&#34; I said, my voice filled with gratitude. The young lady smiled to me quickly as she stood up from the sitting position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t have done it without you.&#34; I said with another smile to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young lady smiled back at me, her eyes shining with pride. &#34;You&#39;re welcome, Miss. It just so easy when you have people there to guide you.&#34; I looked at her suspiciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I dragged the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now getready for that interview!&#34; She said with her own enticing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, we spent the rest of the time preparing for the interview, laughing and joking as we went over my skills and qualifications. I knew that with her by my side, I was ready for anything that came my way during the whole interview section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whose Miss Kate?&#34; A young man with a stunning look came out of the interview room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me,&#34; I quickly stood up, giving a smirk to the man and the young lady who assisted me in almost everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath within me as I walked gently into the room. As I stepped into the room, the man was in a black dress and facing the back of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in my cloth gently and gave a slight cough to make sure I was really there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good day, sir,&#34; I smiled to the man who just sat down there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take your seat.&#34; I dragged back one of the chairs with a smile and sat down. As the man turned around, I was so filled with surprise within me that made me stand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a lovely surprise, Mia,&#34; my heart skipped with the word.</p>
