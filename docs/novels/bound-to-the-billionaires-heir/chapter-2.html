                <p>&#34;Happy birthday to me!&#34; was the first thing I said when I heard my alarm go off next to my bed. Joy flooded my heart as well as my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would turn 20 today and truly become a woman, even though society considers 18 to be the legal age of puberty. My life has already changed significantly since this day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; As soon as I got out of bed and my nose was being attacked by the intriguing smell of food, I asked myself. The inviting aroma of food was calling my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello daughter,&#34; my mother said as soon as I emerged from my room. She had already walked over to greet me with a lovely smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happy birthday, my love!&#34; my mother said with an amusing smile as I heard a lot of strange noises coming from the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I attempted to peek through the window, but my mother quickly stopped me. Her expression revealed something foreign to me, but I simply returned her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother said, &#34;Go get dressed and get ready for that party; there is one out there for you.&#34; Her words alone made me giddy. I received a party hosted on my birthday, which made it extremely memorable for me. This is the first time since my birth that I have received a party invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, Mom,&#34; I said, giving her a brief but incredibly warm embrace. My mother gave me a brief embrace, but as soon as he said her name-&#34;Madam Lucy&#34;-she turned away and left me behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I had been set up for a party before, I was still filled with joy and went straight back to my room. However, I could not understand why a party had been planned for me at this age. Nevertheless, I was so happy that I ignored all of that and went straight to the bathroom to take a hot bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had already finished using the restroom when I went to my closet to choose a dress. However, I was unable to find anything appropriate for the event, so I was left with no choice except to choose a nightgown or go ask my sister-who also happens to be a party animal-for one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I went straight to my sister&#39;s room, I saw that she was completely naked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She instantly reached out to the towel on the floor and covered up her already nude body, saying, &#34;Hey, you were supposed to knock before coming in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ohh, I apologize.&#34; I quickly closed my eyes with my hand to avoid seeing her nude appearance, which she didn&#39;t want me to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it that you need?&#34; As soon as I opened my eyes and saw a white towel wrapped around her chest, which extended all the way up to her knees, she asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinning, I said to her, &#34;A beautiful dress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yelled, &#34;Today is your day and you have no dress,&#34; to me as I simply frowned slightly and stared at her. She was laughing hysterically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What is funny, I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed at me, saying, &#34;You are funny,&#34; which just made me angry and made me regret asking her for a dress in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I told her, &#34;Just take your dress; I am no longer interested,&#34; I left her room, giving her the same sad expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw my mother carrying a tray full of snacks as I made my way to my room, which was fairly far from my sister&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,&#34; I said as I drew nearer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you not wearing a dress yet?&#34; she inquired as I stood grinning and asked me a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told her, &#34;I do not have one that would fit,&#34; and she laughed, instantly making me feel really self-conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother gave me a stern look and said, &#34;Why didn&#39;t Andrew get one for you?&#34; This gave me the confidence to speak with her more effectively at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you bringing up Andrew matter again, mom?&#34; I asked, a small frown already forming on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time my mom brings up the Andrew matter, it just makes me feel so angry with her. My mom still despises my boyfriend, Andrew, so much that it makes me feel horrible about it. Despite this, I still love him and would love to marry him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said, &#34;I am sorry,&#34; and asked if I could give her a moment. My mother approached with a glass cup that contained green liquid, and I stood there for a while. Upon giving it to me, my mother instantly extended her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what purpose is this?&#34; As soon as I took what she gave me with open arms, I inquired. I noticed that it was something unfamiliar when I peered inside the cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother said, &#34;That herbal tea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I questioned, &#34;How does this affect me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother&#39;s words instantly opened my ears: &#34;You would be out today with all the people touching you so you need to take this to prevent getting an infection and also, when you are done with this cup you can go get your dress in the guest room where Andrew is arranging things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately downed the so-called herbal tea, not caring that it tasted bitter; all I wanted was to meet Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I finished the whole glass and squinted my eyes a little bit, I couldn&#39;t just feel my body anymore but just collapsed down to the floor. My body was already not the same after the whole drink my mil gave to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; She&#39;s yours you can have her&#34; I just could hear a little of my mom&#39;s voice but with still a blurred view already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body was active for eager sex and could feel someone already on me having sex with me but still couldn&#39;t leave up a clear view of who it is.</p>
