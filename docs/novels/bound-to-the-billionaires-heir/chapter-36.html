                <p>&#34;Where again, Mia?&#34; Bryan walked closer to me with his questions as I had my fair getting fixed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doing what we planned much earlier, babe,&#34; I responded shortly with a smile at this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please just be safe for me,&#34; he said, giving me a quick peck on myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Okay...&#34; I stood up with a deep breath while Ethan just couldn&#39;t get his eyes off me quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes licked into mine with a much more caring face this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You pervert,&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are more of a pervert than I am.&#34; We both laughed and ended with a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked down the staircase with chatter and laughter towards each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy,&#34; I turned back quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander,&#34; I smiled, stretching my arms towards him to receive a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy, where are you going?&#34; As he embraced him quickly, he made his way to ask the question, which I smiled at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy, are you going to get something for the house?&#34; I lied to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Anita could go, so you can stay,&#34; Ethan interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she&#39;s the main mother of this house and needs to get things for herself,&#34; Ethan helped by also lying to the young boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, mommy,&#34; he said, smiling and giving me a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sweetheart,&#34; I said, kissing his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy,&#34; he called as I tried to discard him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, sweetheart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw the young man in my dream.&#34; Ethan interrupted my words with another look towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Who?&#34; He questioned, giving a Stern look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The man who took me away from the house when you bought it left,&#34; he smiled, feeling so free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Andrew?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s his name,&#34; I smiled fakely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy,&#34; I interrupted his word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethan, I have to go now!&#34; I said it with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly walked out, standing in front of one of the Jeeps, packed almost close to themselves. I stood for a while waiting for Ethan to be done with his child and talk, but standing there just gave me a lot of thinking on how to just get Andrew out of my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you take so much time?&#34; I asked as soon as I noticed the presence of Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why panicking?&#34; He questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You quite don&#39;t understand,&#34; I said, forcing a quick smile on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, just calm down; slow and steady always win,&#34; he said as soon as a driver came closer to one of the Jeep&#39;s and opened up the back door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you called him?&#34; Ethan asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, his home is waiting for me,&#34; I said with a quick frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Smile,&#34; he reacted, pulling my chick from side to side to give me back my smirk, which was I just hiding, knowing that I was about to do something crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wish me luck.&#34; As I said those words, I walked out if he were walking into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan didn&#39;t even give me a reply but a positive smile. Soon, the driver just drove me off the huge mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the trip continued, my heart just kept on racing with anxiety and a lot of thought, thinking of what I was about to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Madam,&#34; the driver quickly snapped me out of the thinking stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What?&#34; I reacted, looking as if I were angry with him snapping me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we stopping?&#34; he questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gave you an address, right?&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but that&#39;s a strict estate, ma&#39;am,&#34; he said, still on his wheels. &#34;People hardly go in there.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Strict estate?&#34; I repeated, my mind racing fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, ma&#39;am, that estate is owned by a very wealthy and influential person. They have tight security, and not many people are allowed in.&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped for a beat as I processed this information. I had expected Andrew&#39;s estate to be luxurious, but I hadn&#39;t anticipated it to be this secure and tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about that; I have an appointment there,&#34; I said confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, ma&#39;am,&#34; he replied, his tone still the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we both approached the estate, I could see that it was surrounded by high walls and iron gates for security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver stopped the car quickly at the entrance and announced our arrival through the intercom for the securities officer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief moment with the guard, the gates swung open, and we drove into the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver pulled up to the front door of the mansion and turned off the engine of the Jeep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here we are, ma&#39;am,&#34; he said, turning to me with a hint of curiosity while my heart kept racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a really deep breath, smoothing my dress and composing myself before stepping out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver followed, opening the door for me and escorting me to the entrance of the huge mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked into the foyer, I was struck by the beauty of the interior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome, Mia,&#34; a voice called out from the top of the staircase, to which I turned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up to see Andrew descending towards me, a smile spreading across his face while mine turned to a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew,&#34; I replied, my voice steady despite my racing heart going faster than I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he reached the bottom of the stairs, he extended his hand, and I took it slowly, allowing him to lead me into the mansion himself while keeping the driver out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must really say, you look so stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked into a luxurious living room, and I couldn&#39;t help but notice the eerie silence of the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I offer you anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thank you,&#34; I replied, my eyes scanning the room for any signs of danger or anything that could take my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well then,&#34; he replied, his smile faltering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, beautiful Mia, what brings you here today?&#34; He asked with a calm tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what was to come at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you actually know why I&#39;m here, Andrew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed slowly, but he just said nothing, simply gesturing for me to continue with my words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really want you to leave my family alone,&#34; I said, my voice firm and serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Mia. You really are so naive, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart gave a fast race as he took a step closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to leave your family alone until I have you back,&#34; he said, his voice dripping with malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In fact, I&#39;m going to do everything within my power to destroy them and get you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blood ran quick cold as I realized the true extent of Andrew&#39;s hatred towards whom I love. I knew I really had to act fast or risk losing everything I held close to my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andrew,you know I&#39;m not going to let that happen,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re no longer a match for me, Mia. I have the power and the resources to do whatever I want and do whatever I choose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll see about that, Andrew,&#34; I said, my voice dripping with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be continued</p>
