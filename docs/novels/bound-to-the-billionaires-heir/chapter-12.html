                <p>Mia POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; What are you doing?&#34; With my wet body I approached Sarah who was busy with my baby .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I approached her with my vein out already, how could she be rough with my baby to already spoil my phone at that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With me seeing my phone on the fall scattered already I felt so devasted with all of that. I gave a squat with pain within me as I picked up my phone turning it around with me hiding my inner tears since I was already an adult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Am literally sorry&#34; I Interrupted Sarah words with anger and revealing veins on my neck .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Why are you so careless?&#34; I questioned with steamy anger in my voice already .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just gave a long hiss to her walking back into the bathroom where I walked out of from . I looked into my phone that was already half destroyed . But,it just didn&#39;t look as if it was a small baby that spoilt the phone but someone more matured and have more matured sense to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Oh My God &#34; I looked at my phone feeling depressed already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why it hurt me the most was that I did almost all my works on that same phone, so that was where I get money from to pay for the motel I stayed at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a spike of frustration and despair as I gazed at my damaged phone, my mind racing with thoughts of how I was going to recover my important files and contacts which was much more important to me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had relied on that phone for everything and it was much like everything to Me, from work to communication with my clients, and now it was all gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath and tried to calm myself down, knowing that lashing out at Sarah wouldn&#39;t solve anything but just get issue worst since she was much close to me already and she loved me and my child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked back into the room with a dried body already, my eyes fixed on her as she held my baby, a look of concern on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kate, I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; she said, her voice soft and apologetic as she walked closer to me with a nice looking face that really tells what she said was totally from her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; It not an issue &#34; i faked my smile to her .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to damage your phone though.&#34; She paused briefly, holding my baby more fame around her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;IIt was an accident.&#34; She said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, feeling a mix of anger and sadness, but still I just gave a smile to the words since I couldn&#39;t do much about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s actually just not just the phone, Sarah.&#34; I restricted my fake smile at that point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all my work, my contacts, my everything. I rely on that phone for my livelihood,&#34; I said as I immediately wore a friend at that point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah&#39;s expression turned sympathetic. &#34;I know, Kate. And I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to help you recover your files and contacts. But please, don&#39;t be too hard on me. I&#39;m just trying to help with the baby.&#34; She gave a face filled with pity. &#34;I promise, Kate,&#34; she pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a pang of guilt, knowing that Sarah was only trying to assist me. I took a deep breath and tried to compose myself and return back to my face smile since I couldn&#39;t bring out one at that point of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I said finally, my voice softer now with a deep smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just calm down and figure out what to do next.&#34; I said to her, sitting on a side of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah nodded, relief written all over her face. &#34;Okay, Kate. Let&#39;s do that.&#34; She said with her own smile, which I couldn&#39;t just give words to-either it was fake or real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, we sat down and started brainstorming ways to recover my files and contacts. Sarah suggested using data recovery software, while I tried to remember if I had backed up my files anywhere else. As we worked together, I couldn&#39;t help but feel grateful for Sarah&#39;s help and support, despite her carelessness earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the hours passed, we managed to recover some of my files, but not all of them. I felt a sense of loss and disappointment, knowing that some of my important work was gone forever. But I also felt grateful for Sarah&#39;s help and support, and I knew that I couldn&#39;t have done it without her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sun began to set, we finally took a break, exhausted but relieved that we had made some progress. I looked at Sarah, and our eyes met, a silent understanding passing between us. We knew that we still had a long way to go, but we were determined to face it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I looked at my baby, who was sleeping peacefully in Sarah&#39;s arms, I felt a spike of love and gratitude. I knew that I couldn&#39;t have made it this far without Sarah&#39;s help, and I was grateful for her presence in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her phone gave a quick buzz, Sarah immediately stood up from our both sitting positions. &#34;Sorry, I have to pick this call,&#34; she said, making her way outside of the room at that time with me still going through my laptop to recover some old lost files.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s she and the baby?&#34; A question From the other side of the phone, she said to Sarah, who looked around like a spy or someone with guilt killing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doing well and first plan had already worked well,&#34; Sarah gave a little chuckle, still looking around like one checking if someone was after her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I voice said from the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah... Sarah...&#34; I stood up, walking outside the room, to see Sarah, who was behaving much like someone who was doing something bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; I questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfectly,&#34; she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Okay...&#34; I smiled, holding up her hands, going back to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what do you wanna show me?&#34; Sarah asked as we both sat down back on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would be going out to seek a job tomorrow, so can you help me stay with my child?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Sarah,&#34; I said finally, my voice sincere. &#34;I don&#39;t know what I would have done without your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sarah smiled, her eyes shining with tears. &#34;You&#39;re welcome, Kate. That&#39;s what friends are for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled back at her, feeling a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that I still had a long way to go, but with Sarah by my side, I felt like I could face anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; Ohh,&#34; she sighed giving a relieve as if I held her tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sarah, what happened?&#34; I asked with a slight chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened, and she tried to cover up her phone. &#34;Nothing, I&#39;m good.&#34;</p>
