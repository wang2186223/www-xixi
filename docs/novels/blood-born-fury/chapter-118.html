                <p>*I feel like I&#39;m a parent and my kids are about to tell me they did a bad thing and killed someone who can&#39;t actually be killed.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan laughed, *Something like that. After Ari and I bonded um*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan blushed and his face was bright red. I couldn&#39;t help but giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Not so easy, is it?* I giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I know you 2 had sex.* Drake pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of us turned beet red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Relax. The mate bond is a lot different than a regular bond. Ivan, you&#39;re mated to Ariya. I figured at some point you 2 would have sex. I don&#39;t need to know the details but I&#39;m guessing it was something after that, that happened.* Drake said after we didn&#39;t talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Right. After all of itumwell Ivan uhcollapsed but like he felt like he was slipping away from me and I panicked.* I said, flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan, were you blacking out?* Drake asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I don&#39;t know. I think so. I just felt like all the strength was drained from me and I couldn&#39;t keep my eyes open. I tried responding to Ari but she said it came out mumbled.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*So I may or may not have given him some of my blood.* I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Really? What happened?* Drake asked, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It felt like an electric shock jolted me back to life. Whatever was happening didn&#39;t end up happening.* Ivan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan, I think you were so ummexhausted that you were falling into a memory. Because you 2 had just completed the bond you might not have had it strong enough to be able to experience the memory from the other person. Ariya, giving him your blood isn&#39;t a bad thing. It&#39;s not something that&#39;s really done but you 2 are mated. It sounds like you give him a boost of your own energy. If you&#39;re hungry it might not work the same way, but it&#39;s a personal thing. If you want to do that, that&#39;s your choice. It&#39;s not going to hurt him or make him crash in the end. It&#39;s more of a boost of energy that he can use.* Drake responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Wait, so you&#39;re not mad?* I asked Drake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Why would I be? Because you gave him some of your own blood? Ari, unfortunately no one here has experience with being mate bonded to an Original Navi Wolf. It means you&#39;re kinda on your own with some of it. There&#39;s probably a lot of experiences that you both will have that none of us are going to understand. I&#39;m here to help and guide the best I can but I wasn&#39;t mate bonded to Derek. Your Mom wasn&#39;t mate bonded to Ivan&#39;s Mom either. So I don&#39;t really have much to go on. You do realize to turn someone that isn&#39;t a Navi into a vampire that they have to take some of our blood right?* Drake asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m not turning Ivan am I?* I asked worriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*No, there&#39;s a lot more to it. You might get him addicted to the feeling though.* Drake laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Too late for that. The second it happened the first time, I wanted it again. Then again, feeling how it is for you guys to feed makes me wonder how you&#39;re able to stop.* Ivan laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Wait. What do you mean, feeling how it is for us to feed?* Drake asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my cheeks turn red. We hadn&#39;t gone into any detail about the mate bond with them. We were still learning things. We weren&#39;t even completely sure of everything that would or could happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan can feel what I feel. The opposite is true too. We&#39;re almost always linked through our thoughts unless we sever the link. Ivan can see my memory if I&#39;m sleeping and he&#39;s awake. I don&#39;t know if it works if we&#39;re both asleep. But we can also use some of the abilities of the other. So Ivan should be able to use my Energy Manipulation and the Dragon&#39;s Eye.* I explained to Drake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Sounds like Ivan has a lot of training to do as well. I knew you guys could talk through your mind but I didn&#39;t realize it was a constant thing. I also didn&#39;t know you both could feel what the other feels.* Drake thought out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yeah, Ari knows what it feels like for me to be fed on by her. It&#39;s something my parents said that I would be able to show her. She knows it doesn&#39;t hurt us at all.* Ivan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*As that bond gets stronger you 2 are likely to become almost untouchable.* Drake pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Like you?* I said, excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m not untouchable, Ariya. Ivan proved that when he beat me up.* Drake laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Sorry.* Ivan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Don&#39;t be. It showed me spots I need to work on. Besides, I&#39;m glad to know that Ariya is well protected. I guess we&#39;ll need to focus on you learning how to use our abilities as well.* Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ari&#39;s got that covered for me. She promised to show me what she knows. So as you teach her, she&#39;ll teach me.* Ivan grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Keo&#39;s done. You&#39;ll probably have to sever the connection with you and Ari so they can work on swapping.* Drake pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*We will. Oh and the answer to Caleb&#39;s question, yes. I can see the mark in my wolf form. I&#39;ll work on him learning how to use his wolf eyes though. And enhance his sense of smell if possible.* Ivan told Drake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It&#39;s going to take a lot Drake, for the swap. Keo and I haven&#39;t fully swapped places yet.* I mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What do you mean? You took over for Keo once when he was beating me up. Keo&#39;s taken over for you in the facility once.* Drake asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yes, but never at the same time. Keo was still in the background when I took over his body. The same way we were all in the background when Keo was in control of mine. We&#39;ve never fully swapped places yet. Only temporarily. I&#39;m not sure how we manage to do it.* I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Well I guess it&#39;s time for some trial and error.* Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Maybe instead of guessing who is who we work on trying to get you both just swapping. Once you get the hang of it we can start guessing?* Ivan offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Sounds like a plan to me. Ariya, you&#39;ll both also have to figure out to let the other know what&#39;s going on later. But for now just see about swapping places.* Drake mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Like knowing what happened last? You both could ask each of us a question and when we swap we can give the answer. That&#39;s probably the best way to test that we know what&#39;s going on when we swap.* I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Sounds good. It would be better if it is simple. Like a 1 word thing that is able to be memorized. But we&#39;ll get there. Good luck, Ariya. I&#39;ll see you soon if it works, kiddo.* Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake cut the connection, leaving Ivan and I alone for a moment. I snuggled into his arms, burying my face in his chest. I breathed him in more as he squeezed me tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m still here. But I don&#39;t think I should have you in my lap when you guys swap. That might be a little weird for Keo and I.* Ivan laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed with him, *Can you imagine? Keo would be a little freaked out.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan gave me a tight hug again and kissed me softly on the lips. He took in a deep breath, breathing in my scent before getting up and moving back to the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Good luck, Ari. You can do this.* Ivan encouraged me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan and I cut our connection so Keo and I could practice. I felt Keo pull at my mind immediately after. I let him so we could face each other and try to figure out how to make this work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Ari!&#34; Keo said, beaming at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped into Keo&#39;s arms and gave him a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss you.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss you too. You&#39;re always hanging out with that wolf though. Sheesh. And you had to go and get yourself caught.&#34; Keo smirked, playing around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I giggled, &#34;How do you suppose we do this? We&#39;ve only ever ridden as a passenger with the other before. Never both swapped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been thinking about that. Whoever pulls at the other is where we end up right? So what if we both pull at the same time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It might work but how would we take control? What if we just end up trapped in the other&#39;s mind like we are here?&#34;</p>
