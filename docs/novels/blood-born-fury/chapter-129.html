                <p>We had decided on meeting tomorrow evening so we could practice some more things. We ran through the idea of working on a couple things at once with each person so we didn&#39;t overstress one aspect. Ariya wanted to start working out in the room but I was slightly worried about Boss noticing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*If it&#39;s subtle he might not notice.* Ariya told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yeah but it probably won&#39;t be subtle, Ari. He doesn&#39;t see you everyday. He only comes in here and there. If he comes in and suddenly you&#39;re a lot different size wise, he&#39;s going to know that something&#39;s up. I would have to tell him you were working out.* I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yeah but if I start working out, he&#39;ll want you to work out more too. Which means you can work on different things at the same time and no one would question it.* Ari pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*True. I could do that regardless. No one would question it. I don&#39;t even think Boss would. He would think that I was just trying to stay in shape.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Possibly, but it&#39;s better to make sure that they aren&#39;t really suspicious of anything. If Boss thinks it&#39;s his idea, he&#39;s less likely to be suspicious.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You&#39;re right about that. I just don&#39;t want someone trying to get me to teach them how to do anything because then we&#39;re adding more people to fight.* I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I think everyone is too scared of you to ask you to teach them.* Ariya giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Do you know if Link and Mya are still with you?* I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s been a while. They were initially but I don&#39;t know that we can completely trust that they&#39;re still on our side. I don&#39;t want to hurt them, but I also don&#39;t know if we can trust them at this point. There&#39;s been so much that&#39;s happened.* Ari told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Better to be safe than sorry, I guess. When the time comes, we&#39;ll make that decision. It&#39;s probably better that they don&#39;t come with us no matter what. But ultimately we can always meet up with them. I can smell if others are around. You&#39;ll be able to soon and so will Caleb. I&#39;m not sure if Caleb is going to be able to do everything I can but I&#39;ll try to teach him everything that I can.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What makes you think that?* Ariya asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*If I&#39;m not mistaken, only 1 of Caleb&#39;s parents were an Original Navi Wolf. That&#39;s why his wolf is so much smaller than mine. He&#39;s still larger than a regular Navi Wolf, but he&#39;s not as big as mine. I think that&#39;s because both of my parents were Original Navi Wolves. I&#39;m not sure though. Everyone&#39;s abilities vary from person to person. I will do everything I can to teach him, I&#39;m just not completely sure how I do everything.* I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Well, good news is that you have 3 Blood Borns to try to help out and when we see your parents again we can ask.* Ariya grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned back at her. We weren&#39;t face to face but we were starting to be able to feel each other&#39;s reactions. I was still working on keeping my facial expressions to a minimum when it came to Ariya and I talking. For the most part she would remain absolutely silent when I had to talk to someone which helped. I think we were both worried about anyone finding out that we could talk. I made my way back to my place and got ready to call it a night. Ariya and I stayed connected the entire time. I felt at ease when I knew she was there. I laid down in bed and felt her pull at my mind. I let my mind go to her. We were back in the room in our mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, there&#39;s no bed here.&#34; I grinned at her, scooping her up in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m not sure how to make anything in here if I&#39;m being honest. I can try but it&#39;s probably not going to be comfortable.&#34; She giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All I need is you. We can lay on the floor.&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think we can actually sleep like this?&#34; Ariya asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not exactly sure. We can try, I just worry that I won&#39;t wake up like I&#39;m supposed to.&#34; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could ask Drake to check on us at the time you need to be up just in case.&#34; Ariya suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s gonna hate us for waking him up super early.&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think he&#39;ll be willing to. He feels really bad for what he did 14 years ago.&#34; Ariya mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I don&#39;t hate him for it. At the moment I did, which is probably why he keeps getting attacked by me. I know that&#39;s not helping him. But now, I understand. It&#39;s been so long, I&#39;m just happy I have you now.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should talk to him.&#34; Ariya said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and Ariya pulled at Drake&#39;s mind. Within a matter of seconds he was standing in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything ok?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just wanted to talk to you. But also ask for a favor.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake smirked, &#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We wanted to try to sleep here. But Ivan is crazy and wakes up at a ridiculous hour of 4am. We weren&#39;t sure if it was possible to sleep here but we also didn&#39;t want him to not wake up in time.&#34; Ariya explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you get up at 4am?&#34; Drake laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gotta get ready for work, make food for Ariya, and get there before Boss shows up. Oh and I have to get my own paperwork done every morning since I spend the entire day in the room with Ariya.&#34; I shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can make sure you guys are up.&#34; Drake laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not everything, Drake.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake nodded, his expression growing serious. He waited for me to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t hate you for taking Ariya away from me. Not now. I did about 14 years ago. But I don&#39;t now.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake sighed, &#34;You may not hate me Ivan, but I hate myself for it. I shouldn&#39;t have done that to you. I&#39;m not even completely sure why I did it. I was trying to keep you all safe but I think I did more harm than good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you hadn&#39;t I don&#39;t know that I would have successfully infiltrated. My memories of Ariya are tied to my wolf. I don&#39;t know how I don&#39;t have access to my wolf when others outside of us are around, but how I feel about her. It would have given me away. Ryker would have seen it. He would have figured out I was an Original Navi Wolf if I still remembered Ariya. Then I&#39;d likely be dead right now.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That still doesn&#39;t excuse my actions. I&#39;m thankful that you were safe, but it might have been better if we all just stuck together. Instead of infiltrating. All that&#39;s gotten us is Ariya captured as a hostage, you having to constantly look over your shoulder, and a target on all 5 of us. They might&#39;ve thought we were dead if I&#39;d just kept us all together. They might not have come looking for us or even found us.&#34; Drake explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like I could see the weight that lay on his shoulders. He blamed himself for everything that was going on. For everything that&#39;s happening now. He took my hits as part of his punishment. But deep down he felt he deserved much worse. Drake had been around for probably over 1,000 years but he looked like he was only in his early to mid 30&#39;s. Drake had lifetimes of experience that none of us did. He&#39;d survived way longer and had probably been around before all the technology of the world created the dystopian world we lived in now. Sure everyone had abilities, but it had led to even more isolation and segregation. We were all that was left of the Navi. The 5 of us. 2 Original Navi Wolves and 3 Blood Borns. The last of our kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need an excuse for your actions. You made a decision based on the information you had at the time. If we didn&#39;t do what we had, we might not have the information that we have now. We would be angry for the death of all our people. Fighting against an enemy blindly. We probably wouldn&#39;t have stood a chance. But right now we do. We can&#39;t change the past. Our decisions got us to where we are now. The only thing we can do is focus on where we want to go and make the decisions that are going to lead us there. This isn&#39;t all on you anymore, Drake. We all make decisions together. Don&#39;t try taking the entire burden on your own.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t make any promises.&#34; Drake smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drake, Ivan&#39;s right. Yeah, Caleb and I felt abandoned. But getting our memories back. Remembering and re-living the horrors of that night. I understand just like Ivan does. I might not agree with every decision that was made but we understand it. We don&#39;t hate you for the choices you made. Though Ivan keeps attacking you.&#34; Ariya said, looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned sheepishly, &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t help it. I actually feel like I&#39;m back to the night it happened. I don&#39;t know why. But remember, my entire drive is to protect you. To keep you safe. That whole night I kept losing you and you were in danger. I watched you practically die in front of me and there was nothing I could do. I couldn&#39;t even talk to anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya and Drake looked at me sadly. They could see the memories as they flashed through my mind. How much fear I had. How I thought I was losing Ariya. I was so scared that night and my emotions just ruled over me. I wasn&#39;t thinking clearly. My singular thought was of trying to protect Ariya and I had failed not once or twice that night but three times. Twice she had been taken by the enemy and she had practically died in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear, I won&#39;t let anything or anyone take her away from you again, Ivan.&#34; Drake swore to me.</p>
