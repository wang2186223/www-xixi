                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why you&#39;re able to teach us!&#34; Ivan exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. But we took a risk. We had a feeling but when Mina took the remainder from me she sealed it into you, Ivan. The only way we would appear is if you were actually mated like we thought.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Mom explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at Ivan, smiling. I could see his eyes start to water and I immediately became concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan.&#34; I said, looking up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan looked down at me and smiled, &#34;I&#39;m ok, Ari. I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan leaned down and kissed me. Then he squeezed me tightly. He held onto me like a lifeline and I hugged him tightly to let him know I was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; Ivan whispered in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There will be more moments that we&#39;ll be able to come back. But they&#39;re only going to be at key points. Unfortunately we can&#39;t tell you everything about what&#39;s going to happen but we can try to help with some things.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Dad explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both turned our attention to his parents and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right, so first things first, now that you both are bonded to each other, everything will be different. The more connected you both are the faster you&#39;ll be able to learn the abilities you can borrow from one another. It also means the stronger your bond will become.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Dad said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happens when Ivan is Justin?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Ivan tense up behind me and heard a low growl come from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down, Ivan. That will be clearer soon. Justin is not the one you bonded with. You bonded with Ivan. Ivan is the only one that was able to access his wolf which means that Justin wouldn&#39;t have access to the mate bond anyway. You both will need to be extremely careful though.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Dad said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That said, Ivan. You are going to need to make sure you control yourself. Both of you will. By completing the mate bond you both feel each other now. Which means that your need to protect one another is stronger as well. Ivan, you are going to have to be in control of your actions. Keep in mind that Ariya is by all means imprisoned right now. You may be one of the only people that are allowed in the area that Ariya is in, but others are around. Be aware of that.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Mom said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya, unfortunately for you, your hunger is also going to increase. The more you use your abilities the more hunger you will have. Your hunger as a vampire is not only linked to time and injuries but also to the use of your abilities. By being connected through your mind, you&#39;re going to need to feed more often. It won&#39;t be like that forever. Eventually it will slow down. But because you&#39;re a new vampire and a newly mate bonded one along with it, controlling that hunger will likely be difficult.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Dad told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gulped, nervously, &#34;I felt it before I passed out and was brought here. I just fed a bunch from Ivan beforehand too. Does that mean I&#39;m going to have to drain him daily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only as long as you guys keep the mind link open.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Dad said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget it&#39;s only temporary. You will eventually be able to feed less.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Mom added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s going to be ok, Ari. I can handle it. We can do it every morning and every night. Besides, I have to make it a point to give you the blood bags as well. Or Boss will notice.&#34; Ivan reassured me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but doesn&#39;t it hurt? I don&#39;t want to hurt you daily, much less multiple times a day.&#34; I said, sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan and his parents burst out laughing. I looked at all of them confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ari, I already told you this. We need you guys to feed off of us. It hurts really bad otherwise. You&#39;re the only one that can do that for me. But trust me, it doesn&#39;t hurt.&#34; Ivan told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s right, Ariya. We do need it. It really doesn&#39;t hurt us. When your Mom fed from me, it felt more like a relief than anything. It was like she was taking a weight off of me. It didn&#39;t hurt.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Mom said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And with the mate bond, Ivan doesn&#39;t feel any pain at all. You should show her, Ivan.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Dad added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan cocked his head to the side, &#34;Show her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s something you can do with the mate bond. Remember, you feel how she feels. The same thing goes the other way around. If you focus on how you&#39;re feeling, she will feel it.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Dad explained to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan looked at me, &#34;I&#39;ll show you next time. You&#39;ll have to let me feel what it&#39;s like when you feed though too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blushed, &#34;Deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back to the mate bond changes, you noticed the eye color changes, yes?&#34; Ivan&#39;s Mom asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We nodded in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya, your vampire eyes are now permanently the color of Ivan&#39;s wolf eyes. The only time you&#39;ll get the red is when you lose control or in anger. Which means you&#39;ll need to be extremely careful in front of Boss.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Mom continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As for the marks, the invisible ones are only seen using your wolf and vampire eyes. No one else can see them.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Dad said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the visible ones?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re only visible to one of Navi blood. That doesn&#39;t mean to be careless. Plenty of the Navi scattered when it became known that we were feared. They went into hiding. So some are of Navi blood and they just don&#39;t know it.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Dad explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do we know?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t. Unfortunately no one is able to know. But typically if someone can see it, it means that they&#39;re either a wolf or a vampire.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Mom said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guess that means to keep my shirt on and don&#39;t let it get ripped when I&#39;m at work then right?&#34; Ivan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as you don&#39;t have access to your wolf, the mark should be invisible. It&#39;s like your hair.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Dad said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which brings me to a very important topic. Ivan, you do not need to worry about possibly exposing who you are in front of Boss and everyone there. At least not by standing in front of them. They will not be able to see your mark and your hair will not be how it is now in front of them. You will not have access to your wolf. The only way they will figure it out is if you do not control your feelings. This is not going to be easy for you, but remember that Ariya is very strong and you will always be there to fix her up after. Ariya, should you need Ivan to have access to his wolf for any reason, you only need to call our names. It will be there should you need it.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Mom told us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep in mind, it can only be done once. Once Ivan&#39;s wolf is revealed, the action cannot be undone. He has access with you and the other 3. But should you call for us to unlock it for him, it cannot be locked again.&#34; Ivan&#39;s Dad warned.</p>
