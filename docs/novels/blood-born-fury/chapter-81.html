                <p>*Ivan*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay there in Ariya&#39;s arms, breathing heavily. She had sat down so my head was in her lap as she kept her arms wrapped around me. The fog was clearing in my head as I realized what I&#39;d done. I whined softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok, Ivan.&#34; Drake coughed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can someone explain what happened? I&#39;m kinda lost.&#34; Caleb asked, helping Drake sit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my fault. I didn&#39;t realize it until he spoke after beating me. He got his memory back of the night you all got separated.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled in response. I was still angry but I wasn&#39;t as angry as I had been a bit ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s more to it..&#34; Ariya trailed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean, kiddo?&#34; Drake asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan and I have been getting our memories back slowly. When we get them back we basically relive the moment because it happens in a dream. Usually we have a minute to process it. But this time Boss walked in so I had to force Ivan out of the dream. I don&#39;t think he finished the memory and I think that has part to do with it. But Boss walking in and him losing it for a second, I think it&#39;s messing with him. But I also don&#39;t know everything that happened. He told me some of it and it&#39;s not pretty.&#34; Ariya said, stroking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. It wasn&#39;t like that for me. Drake worked on unlocking my memories and after a while it was all there. For me it was like I relived all of it at one time just at a faster pace. I didn&#39;t have the emotional processing issue that you guys are having by only getting pieces back.&#34; Caleb said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You also didn&#39;t witness as many horrors as they did, Caleb.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Caleb asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whined thinking back. Ariya&#39;s grip on me tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are stuck in the moment that we remember. My first memory was of the fire. I had known about it but I didn&#39;t know all the details. Caleb, I went for a walk that night. I ran into Ivan and my Mom. I didn&#39;t realize it was going to be the last moment that I was happy and at peace.&#34; Ariya told Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb looked at the ground, &#34;Before I had my memories back I would have argued saying that you&#39;ve had plenty of good days since everything happened. But having my memories back, a light died in you that night, Ariya.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled in response to Caleb and he held his hands up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll understand what he means soon, Ivan. He&#39;s not saying anything bad. Ariya is Ariya. But she&#39;s been through a lot and it shows. When you remember everything you&#39;ll remember how animated Ariya was before.&#34; Drake laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! I was a little kid! Of course I was really animated!&#34; Ariya pouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed but it came out more like a snort which made Ariya laugh in response. She squeezed me tightly and I leaned my head against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know they went through a lot, Drake, but I still don&#39;t get it. Why are the memories so much harder on them?&#34; Caleb asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb, I watched my Mom get burned alive in front of me. Ivan tried to fight back and then they took me away. Then I watched Keo get injured while he tried to protect me. Then Ivan got us out of there and after that, Keo was killed in front of us along with Derek. I was hauled off again and then I thought that Ivan was killed because of the sounds he made&#34; Ariya said, the tears forming in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s eyes went wide with shock. He knew of some things but he clearly didn&#39;t know about everything. He got his memories back but he didn&#39;t see things as they happened. I was sure he blamed himself for not being there to help but it still wasn&#39;t the same as being there and being helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan&#39;s anger toward me is justified. The one person that kept him moving regardless of his pain and regardless of what happened was taken away from him. By me. It makes sense that he wants to kill me.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His shifts are so violent because of his last shift before you took the memories. At least that&#39;s the theory. His last shift was very violent, kinda how the other shifts have been.&#34; Ariya mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s eyes went wide again, &#34;I wasn&#39;t there for the shift but I was there right after it. I heard Ivan scream for someone to help. When I got there he was in wolf form though. The sounds he made&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake nodded, &#34;That&#39;s what I mean. His anger toward me is justified. Imagine going through all of that, finding out that your mate is ok, just to have her ripped away from you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled in response. Drake wasn&#39;t wrong. I hated him for it. But more than anything, I just wanted Ari to be safe. I would do anything for her. As long as she was ok, I would be ok. I would endure anything to make sure she was ok. Ariya&#39;s arms squeezed me tightly again and I relaxed a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Ivan. I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t keep my promise to you. I didn&#39;t remember.&#34; Caleb said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry too. You can beat me as much as you like, Ivan. I deserve it. The same goes for you, Ariya.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you do it though? Why did you have Ivan infiltrate to begin with? Why not just have Ivan take me somewhere safe? If you had to have him infiltrate, why not have him infiltrate and stay with me?&#34; Ariya asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. There wasn&#39;t time to think. We didn&#39;t have any time for anything. Derek left me a dying wish and that wish gave me an idea. I was emotional and I wanted all of you to be safe so I acted out of emotion. Ivan was the oldest out of you 4 and he&#39;d had the most training. I figured he would be able to infiltrate without as many issues as Caleb. But keeping you safe was important. Ivan couldn&#39;t really infiltrate with how he looked, they would have figured it out. So I had to take parts of his memory away to make sure that he looked different. Hiding his wolf is what changed his hair color. That is what gave him the ability to infiltrate. If Ivan remembered being a wolf and left with you, you guys would have been found easier. Caleb on the other hand can blend a lot easier. I made an emotional decision without really thinking it through and when I was able to think things through I convinced myself that I was right. I can see now that I was wrong.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you weren&#39;t wrong&#34; Ariya said, her eyes getting big.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the wheels turning in her head. I also knew that she and Keothi were able to think up plans that had backup plans. Those backup plans also have backup plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; Caleb asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The person that was with me had to remember being a wolf. Otherwise I don&#39;t think I would still have the same mindset. I think I would have ended up how Ivan is as Justin. But that&#39;s not the point. Maybe, just maybe, we can spin this in a way that Boss trains me.&#34; Ariya said, her eyes lighting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her, pretty sure I knew where this was going. Not sure if I would like it or not. But I trusted her. We couldn&#39;t get out of there even if we wanted to right now. I pulled away from her. My body shivered and I shifted back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s right. If we can spin it to where Boss starts training her that&#39;s better. We couldn&#39;t get her out of there right now even if we wanted to.&#34; I told them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? You don&#39;t think we&#39;re strong enough?&#34; Drake growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. You aren&#39;t. Drake I know you aren&#39;t going to try to kill me but you couldn&#39;t stop me from beating on you. I was the most trained before that night, but I&#39;ve had a lot more training since then. That&#39;s not the problem though. You guys can take out any of the lower level people. It&#39;s the higher levels, ones that Ariya hasn&#39;t even seen yet. They&#39;re the ones to watch out for. They&#39;re the ones that Boss is going to use to hunt you down. They&#39;re only the first problem. The biggest problem is Boss. His ability controls the gravity around a person. Unless we can get around that, we&#39;re never going to get Ariya out of there. You guys can&#39;t take the risk of coming in to help either. It&#39;s too much of a risk of having more people caught. The only way that Ariya is getting out of there is when she and I decide it&#39;s time. For you guys to help you would have to break in and break out. By the time you broke in alone Boss could be there. Then we&#39;re all caught. You guys can join the fight only after we&#39;ve gotten outside. Before that, it&#39;s not going to happen.&#34; I told them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan&#39;s right. That place is a fortress. Ivan, you&#39;re talking about the 8 Enforcers, aren&#39;t you?&#34; Ariya asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. Not only do we have to worry about the 8 Enforcers coming after us once we&#39;re out, but we have to deal with Boss before that as well.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s the 8 Enforcers?&#34; Drake asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not completely sure. I just know that they&#39;re 8 different people who are part of a group that Boss refers to as the Enforcers. They&#39;re extremely strong and their abilities are off the charts. Let me put it this way, Drake, if you use your ability you should be able to wipe the floor with me. Hand to hand alone, I should be able to win. But with your ability you win. These 8, their abilities are on par with your strength if not more.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So we need to get Ariya out of there before they show up, right?&#34; Caleb asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but we can&#39;t get past Boss yet. Like I said, his ability controls the gravity around a person. Until we find a way around that, we&#39;re not getting Ariya out of there.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think there&#39;s more to it, Ivan. I don&#39;t think Boss only controls the gravity around a person.&#34; Ariya whispered.</p>
