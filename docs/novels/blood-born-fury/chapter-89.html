                <p>chapter Eighty Nine</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I padded down the road. It was early in the morning but I knew I needed to be careful. I was on high alert for any scent nearby. So far I was good. No one was near. I wasn&#39;t sure how I was going to find Drake. I wasn&#39;t exactly sure where they were so I headed to the forest where I saw them last. I decided when I got there I would howl and they could come to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a few hours before I usually showed up to work. I didn&#39;t want to take too long though. I wanted to make sure I had enough time to get food for Ariya before I went in. Boss had told me to feed her more so she would be sleepier. Both of us were ok with it. It meant that Ariya wasn&#39;t starving for regular food and she was more likely to get memories back faster. Which meant we could leave there sooner if we needed to. I was worried about what Boss&#39; plans were after she got all of her memories back. I was sure that he would want to start torturing her. I wasn&#39;t ready for that. I didn&#39;t want her to get hurt. She said she had an idea. When she told me about it I wasn&#39;t sure if it would work but the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like it could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arrived at the forest without running into anyone. I had put a backpack on my back before shifting so I would have my shoes and a shirt when I shifted back. I put an extra shirt and shoes in the bag and planned on giving it to Drake to hold on to. Just in case. I sniffed the air around to test if anyone was nearby. No one was near me so I howled out. I hoped that one of them would hear me. If they didn&#39;t I would have to try to find them myself. I wasn&#39;t sure I would be able to pick up their scent quick enough if I went wandering around on my own. I had no idea where to even start looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught a scent heading in my direction and recognized it as Caleb. I sniffed the air trying to make sure that no one else was coming outside of them. Luck seemed to be on our side because they were the only ones heading toward me. I ran in their direction, knowing I would run into them faster that way. After a few minutes I saw Caleb running toward me in his wolf form. His ears perked up as he came to a stop. He cocked his head to the side and I sniffed the air again. I couldn&#39;t smell any other scents aside from the 4 of us. No one was around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded at Caleb and we both shifted back to our human form. Caleb started stretching out his arms and back. I looked at him curiously and he laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I may or may not have spent the night as a wolf.&#34; Caleb said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t solve my confusion, that actually makes it worse.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo laughed, &#34;Apparently when Ari was old enough it was easier to hide in plain sight with Caleb pretending to be her dog. They didn&#39;t have to worry about Caleb shifting monthly and no one would question a girl having a giant dog as protection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. I kinda got used to being in wolf form so it&#39;s a bit of an adjustment being in human form so much now. Sometimes I stay as a wolf for the day. Remember, unlike you I can communicate with these 2.&#34; Caleb laughed, teasing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flinched at the comment thinking back to the night I couldn&#39;t find anyone while everyone was dying around me. Drake put his hand softly on my shoulder bringing me back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe keep the teasing to a minimum for now, Caleb. I know you don&#39;t mean anything by it but they don&#39;t have their memories back completely yet. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to trigger Ivan or Ariya right now.&#34; Drake said, gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t trying to punish Caleb or be mean but he was trying to protect Ariya and I. I looked at him, grateful. Caleb looked at me apologetically but I waved him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stress about it. We&#39;re just trying to get through everything. The memories are coming back more frequently now. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here, why I called you guys here. Drake, I need you to add something to the lock you created that separates me from Justin.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake stared at me for a moment and it was like I could see the moment that it clicked for him and he remembered. He nodded and immediately put his hand on my forehead. Keo and Caleb just watched as Drake adjusted the lock. When he removed his hand he looked at me curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t really want to talk about it. I need to talk to Ari first. It&#39;s not fair if I tell you guys and she doesn&#39;t know. Besides, I don&#39;t have much time. I need to get back to her. Just know that the communication part might get fixed.&#34; I said, not completely sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You learned about the mate bond?&#34; Caleb asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded but didn&#39;t say anything more. I knew they wouldn&#39;t push for answers. They didn&#39;t push me to talk when I wasn&#39;t ready. Not unless it was important. This was important but it didn&#39;t involve them. It was between Ariya and I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stress about telling her. Whatever it is. Whatever it entails. My sister loves you. She always has. From the day we met you, she&#39;s loved you. She&#39;s wanted nothing but to protect you and make you happy.&#34; Keo told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted uncomfortably, &#34;That doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s going to be willing to do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know my sister. She will. So don&#39;t stress out about it. Just tell her. Whatever it is you&#39;re worried about, she&#39;s probably already told you your answer. You just might not have realized it.&#34; Keo said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just be careful, Ivan.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him curiously. I wondered if he knew what my parents had said. I wasn&#39;t sure. One day if we were ever able to talk just the 2 of us I would ask. Drake nodded at me like he could read my thoughts. I took the bag off of my back and pulled out the shirt and shoes I had in it. I put them on quickly and looked at Drake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just in case?&#34; Drake asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YeahDo you know?&#34; I asked him, deciding I couldn&#39;t wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I added it to the lock I learned. It&#39;s a generalized lock so I won&#39;t need to do it again. The rest will be private. It&#39;s like the rest of your memories. You will have them as you. But not when you&#39;re Justin.&#34; Drake explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not going to ask either. That&#39;s between you and my sister.&#34; Keo said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure if I want to know the answer, but Keo, why do you seem so ok with me being mated to your sister?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo laughed, &#34;Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was a little weird at first but that was when we were kids. I used to tease her about her liking you more than I teased you about liking her. But you don&#39;t choose who you&#39;re mated to. If you were a bad guy I wouldn&#39;t be ok with it, but I know you. You&#39;re a good guy and you&#39;ve always looked out for her. Why do you think I hated it when she liked you as Justin? Because that wasn&#39;t actually you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled, &#34;I hate me as Justin. But at least with the change of the lock it&#39;s different. I know I&#39;m me, but I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s like all the judgment and hate was Justin and that part is gone. Instead it&#39;s just my wolf side and my memories are behind a barrier. I know it&#39;s there but I don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds confusing.&#34; Caleb said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me about it.&#34; I laughed.</p>
