                <p>I couldn&#39;t hold back anymore. As Justin dragged me to my feet, everyone&#39;s eyes were on me, including Justin&#39;s, but it was too late. With one swift movement, I launched myself forward sinking my fangs into Justin&#39;s neck. Justin gasped in pain and tried shoving me off of him. I could feel the strength returning to me. I pulled my arms apart as hard as I could, breaking the cuffs. With my hands free, I grabbed hold of Justin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO!!!&#34; Keo screamed, &#34;ARIYA STOP!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Justin continued trying to shove me off. I released Justin for a second, but I wanted more. I needed more. This time I bit down hard onto the artery. I could feel the blood pouring out. A growl escaped me as I started losing control. Justin stopped fighting me. I could hear his heart slowing down. I looked over at Keo while I continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya! You have to stop! Please!&#34; Keo begged me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small whine on my right caught my attention. Then a sharp pain vibrated through my body. I cried out in pain, releasing Justin who fell back and slid to the floor. I turned and glared, growling hatefully at Olivia who just electrocuted me. I barred my fangs at her and shoved her into the wall as hard as I could. She hit the wall and then crumpled up into a heap on the floor - unconscious. As I started towards her, a blade whistled through the air and then buried itself into my right shoulder. I growled in response to the blade, then took my left hand and ripped the blade out. I stared at the blade in my left hand, glaring at it. To my left Justin coughed and gasped for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gosh! Justin!&#34; Mya cried out, running to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mya kneeled down and began healing him. Her left leg touched my foot and I instantly calmed down and regained control. My fangs receded and my eyes went back to normal. I turned and looked at Link and Boss. They eyed me suspiciously as I cut the ropes holding Keo in the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re leaving. Now.&#34; I told them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to pay for all of this, Ariya!&#34; Boss told me with acid in his voice, &#34;Just you wait Ariya. I&#39;m gonna kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try me.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One day, Ariya. One day. When the time is right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Keo and I turned to leave. As we cleared the door we bolted down the hallway. Keo pulled his shirt off and handed it to me. I grabbed it and pulled it over my head, thankful that I wasn&#39;t as exposed anymore. I saw the same type of scar in the center of his chest. I wanted to ask but there wasn&#39;t time. Boss would sound the alarm at any moment. As we ran down the hallway making turn after turn to navigate through the building the alarm sirens went off. Keo and I grabbed our heads, the siren sent waves of pain through us. The siren hurt everyone that was near it, so it didn&#39;t last too long. As the siren wails stopped, Keo and I went to continue running. After I passed by a corner, a shadow popped up and sliced Keo&#39;s arm as we ran by. Keo gasped in pain. I growled in response and grabbed the shadow. I threw him hard against the wall, just like I did with Olivia. Just like Olivia, the Shadow crumpled into a heap on the floor, unconscious. I immediately went to Keo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; I asked, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, he didn&#39;t get me too bad.&#34; Keo said, lifting his arm up to see the wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keo&#34; I trailed off, concerned about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop worrying so much.&#34; Keo said, grabbing me and pulling me to him. He kissed the top of my head. I buried my face in his chest. He was warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ButI justI don&#39;t remember everything and I don&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo held me tighter for a second and then let go. Blood gushed out of his arm more and I stepped back growling. I was losing control again. I was still hungry. My fangs pushed their way out and my eyes changed color. My breathing quickened as I tried to maintain control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya?&#34; Keo called my name, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked closer toward him, hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok, Ari. You can feed from me if you want, I won&#39;t stop you. But it&#39;s not going to help you at all. Only Caleb can really do that right now. Unless you wanna start killing everyone here.&#34; He said looking at me, his expression soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing Caleb&#39;s name, and the name that I felt so familiar to coming from him, I stopped and looked at Keo confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You weren&#39;t supposed to get the same scars as me, Ari.&#34; Keo said, brushing his hand over my left eye. He was one of the only people who ever called me Ari.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo&#39;s eyes changed and his fangs came out. I stared at him wide-eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; I breathed, he looked like he was still the same age as me, but when we turned we didn&#39;t age anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Later, you needed to know that I did, but right now we need to go. I will explain it all in detail as soon as we can. But we need to get out of here. For now, it&#39;s just something to do with our weirdo twin thing.&#34; Keo said grinning wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed and hugged him tightly. Forgetting completely about the hunger I felt. &#34;I&#39;ve missed you, Keo. I thought you were dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve missed you too, Ari. You&#39;re not completely wrong. But we need to get out of here. Based on your reactions, I&#39;d say you&#39;re brand new at this. Right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, &#34;Less than 24 hours I think? I don&#39;t remember anymore. Everything&#39;s happening so fast it&#39;s blurring together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to get out of here.&#34; Keo said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and then took off. Running toward the doors that would lead us to freedom. As we approached the door the intercom keyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Ariya.&#34; Boss cooed, &#34;If you leave now, you&#39;ll never find out who is in interrogation room 2 and 4.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo and I stopped. Frozen in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who knows,&#34; Boss cooed, &#34;It could be your little doggy. His name was Caleb, right?&#34;</p>
