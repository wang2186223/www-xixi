                <p>&#34;What do you mean more to it?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t really put my finger on it. But I feel like there&#39;s more to it. Like we&#39;re only seeing part of what he can do.&#34; Ariya told us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to know before you try to break out.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, &#34;How can we swing this idea of yours, Ari?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya went over the idea, Keo and her had come up with a plan. Since he was there but in the background he knew everything that was happening. He&#39;d been taking things in and thinking about it and when the idea hit her head he started putting it together with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s dangerous, Ariya.&#34; Drake warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but it might make escaping easier. At the very least it would give us more insight on the other players involved.&#34; Ariya said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not wrong. Boss isn&#39;t going to keep me watching her forever. But this plan might allow that to happen. It also provides a way for her to learn as much as she can before trying to get out.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if he doesn&#39;t believe you though?&#34; Caleb asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then nothing changes. We stay where we are right now. I just have torture coming for me and I&#39;m not sure when that is going to happen.&#34; Ariya said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to bond. The sooner the better.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was worried she would reject the idea but her eyes lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan&#39;s right. We need to make that happen. We just don&#39;t know how. I know we need to wait for our memories, but do you know how it works?&#34; Ariya asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. That was part of what Derek&#39;s dying wish was. He wanted me to seal the memory of the bond away. I&#39;m not totally sure why but I sealed it on myself as well.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know how the regular bond works. When you unlocked my memories, I got that part back. But I don&#39;t know how the mate bond works. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot more to it. The regular bond isn&#39;t too complicated. If you&#39;re sure that you both are going to do the mate bond, regardless of what it is, then I can bond with Keo like I had planned initially.&#34; Caleb said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, we&#39;ll do what we can. I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll be able to do it immediately. We have to have our memories back for it first and then we can figure out the details.&#34; Ariya said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to take too long to come back. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot more to it but I&#39;m sure that memory will come back soon enough.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about bonding though, Caleb?&#34; Drake asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as Keo&#39;s good with it. I don&#39;t mind. I&#39;m feeding both of you right now anyway. It doesn&#39;t change anything for me. But I have a feeling it changes a lot when it comes to a mate bond.&#34; Caleb said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keo says he&#39;s good with it. As for the mate bond, we&#39;ll figure it out. Are you still able to feed Drake if you bond?&#34; Ariya asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. The regular bond will actually bond me directly to Keo but by default it will bond me to Drake a bit as well.&#34; Caleb said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I gotta get moving. I have things I gotta pick up before I head back to Ariya. If I&#39;m gone too long they might get suspicious.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful. Oh and don&#39;t stress out about us fighting either. You don&#39;t have any visible injuries that they will see, but you do have some injuries. Have Ariya practice fixing your ribs when you get back. Using her hands, that is.&#34; Drake told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded at him and then left to go get everything on the list before I headed back. They had decided to go back to the safe house and strategize some more. I promised Ariya I would be back to her within an hour at the most. I ran home to clean up really quickly and then grab everything. I was able to put the mat on my back like a backpack since it was rolled up in its packaging. The pillow was rolled up in a sealed bag and I rolled the blanket in a similar way. After rolling them I used the straps from the mat to hold onto the pillow and blanket so they were all on my back. I grabbed food from a little shop down the street and headed back to the facility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went through the same routine of putting everything on the counter for them to look at briefly. The guard seemed to shake in fear when I came through this time. Good. I liked it better when they didn&#39;t talk to me. I made it back to the holding room that Ariya was in without running into any annoyances this time. I walked in, set everything down and then flashed my wolf eyes at her. Her eyes lit up as she ran to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scooped her up in my arms and kissed her. When she was in my arms was the only time that things felt right. I felt at peace even given the situation we were in. I set her down and took her face gently in my hands. I kissed her passionately. I wanted nothing more than to devour her right there. A soft growl escaped me as I explored her mouth with my tongue. I felt my body shiver in excitement. My wolf, begging to come out. I brushed my tongue over her canines knowing what it would do. Ariya&#39;s control was amazing but she couldn&#39;t help her fangs coming out when I ran my tongue near them. She let out a sound between a growl and a moan escape her. I loved it. I loved making her lose a bit of control around me. I didn&#39;t want her to be at a rabid stage. But her not being able to hold back showing herself to me in a sensual moment, it was my favorite thing. Ariya pressed up against me but pulled away from the kiss breathing heavily. I could feel my excitement pick up as I started getting hard. I pressed my body against her as well. I knew she would feel what it was doing to me. I trailed kisses down her neck wanting to be closer to her. Ariya sucked in a sharp breath and a growl came from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I breathed heavily as I pulled away from her, &#34;Sorry, princess. I got a little carried away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, please don&#39;t apologize. I&#39;m justhungry.&#34; Ariya blushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her concerned, &#34;We need our memories back so I can start feeding you like you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan&#34; She growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, princess. I want you to feed from me. I hope I can show you how it feels one day. But it&#39;s not like how they taught us. For us wolves it doesn&#39;t hurt. It&#39;s needed and with the mate bond, I&#39;m sure it feels different for me than it does for Caleb. I want you to bite me. It feels good when you do. Especially when you close the wound with your tongue.&#34; I said, my eyes flashing at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya&#39;s eyes went dark as she began to kiss me again. I wrapped my arms around her, pulling her closer to me. I wanted more. I wanted to feel every part of her. I wanted to bond with her. I wanted her to feed from me. I wanted to be inside of her. I wanted to be hers completely. Ariya broke the kiss and this time she was the one that trailed kisses down to my neck. I felt her fangs scrape against my neck which lit a trail of fire for me. A soft moan came out of her. She wanted to sink her fangs in my neck as much as I wanted her to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Ari.&#34; I begged her, my breathing heavy.</p>
