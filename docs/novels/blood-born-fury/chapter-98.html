                <p>*Ivan*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I collapsed on top of her, unable to catch my breath after the 3rd round. Ariya had been a lot hungrier than I had realized and had drained 3 full bodies worth of blood. We had made love to each other the entire time and I was drained physically. I was out of stamina but I also felt like I was floating on a cloud. I was exhausted and I could tell she was too. I moved off of her so she wasn&#39;t pinned under me. We both lay there trying to catch our breath. I felt my eyes flutter close as the exhaustion was taking over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of panic hit me and it was only enough to wake me up a bit. I knew why she was panicking. She was worried she had hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shhhh, it&#39;s ok, Ari. I&#39;m ok. I&#39;m just tired. That was a lot, but it was so worth it.&#34; I mumbled softly, my eyes refusing to open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel like you&#39;re slipping away from me.&#34; She said, the panic not going away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to comfort her but she was right, the darkness was enveloping me. I was losing consciousness but I knew it was just from exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her prick her tongue with something sharp and felt her grab my face. She pulled me to her kissing me. Her tongue entered my mouth and I jolted. My eyes flew open and I sat up quickly breathing heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her stunned, &#34;What was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya giggled, &#34;I shared some of my blood with you. Apparently that&#39;s what happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know that would happen?&#34; I asked her, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t. I was just scared you were going to leave me. I didn&#39;t want to lose you.&#34; She said, looking like she was in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are never going to lose me and I&#39;m never going to actually leave you. I might have to go for a bit but I promise I&#39;ll always come back to you. You have nothing to worry about, Ari. I&#39;m here. I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34; I consoled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya pulled me back down to the mat so I was laying there with her. I gathered her into my arms as she nestled her head in my chest. I smiled in response. I loved it when she curled up against me and buried her head into my chest. It sent warmth through me. I held her tightly as we lay there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; She asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am now. I mean I was before but I was just exhausted. It took a lot out of me is all. I think I was just passing out from exhaustion. I could feel your panic though. I wanted to tell you everything was ok. I tried to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did but it came out mumbled. I felt like you were slipping away. I just got so scared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok. Sharing your blood with me apparently sends me into overdrive. I feel like I got an electric charge. The exhaustion is still there but not so much that I couldn&#39;t pretend I was totally normal.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long before you have to leave?&#34; She asked, sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were going at it for a while, I probably have to leave soon. I don&#39;t want to though. I just want to stay here, with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish you could stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;d never leave your side if I could avoid it, princess.* I said in my head to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me surprised, &#34;Did you say that out loud or in your head?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned at her, &#34;In my head. Remember, we can talk to each other now. Just because I have to go home doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t still be with you. I just have to get out of the building first. Then I&#39;m all yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Unless your memories disappear.* She grumbled in her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, &#34;Only for a bit. I promise, I&#39;ll come back to you as fast as I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is going to take some getting used to.&#34; She laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll practice. I don&#39;t mean to intrude on your thoughts though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a surge of panic again and I blinked in surprise. Ariya took my face in her hands and kissed me hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not intruding. I want you to hear what I&#39;m thinking. Things just sometimes hit my head before I say it. That&#39;s all.&#34; Ariya told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just promise me you&#39;ll tell me if you don&#39;t want it to happen. I can&#39;t promise I know how to stop it but we can work on that part if you want.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the only one I want to know my every thought. The only time I worry about it is if it&#39;s you as Justin. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen when you aren&#39;t you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about what she said. She wasn&#39;t wrong. What would happen if I was Justin? I wasn&#39;t sure if we would still feel each other or not. I wasn&#39;t sure how this all worked honestly. I knew that things would be different and that we would be able to do different things but I was pretty sure we would have to work on our new abilities and that it wasn&#39;t just an instant thing that we could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya took my face in her hands, &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to worry you, Ivan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped back to reality, &#34;It&#39;s ok, princess. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen either. We need to figure things out though. There&#39;s a lot that we have to do now that we&#39;re bonded. I just want to make sure you&#39;re safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned down and kissed her. I would do anything to protect her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I, you, Ivan.&#34; She whispered against my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, &#34;I kinda like this, you being able to read my mind, know my thoughts, and feelings. It is going to take some getting used to though. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready for the others to be able to communicate with me like this yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you&#39;re ready. You&#39;ve already figured out how to communicate with them without it so they can wait until you&#39;re ready.&#34; Ariya told me confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another reason that I love you.&#34; I laughed, &#34;I need to get going though. They&#39;re going to get suspicious if I wait too long and I can&#39;t tell Boss you had a memory because he&#39;ll expect to learn more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Reach out to me when you can?&#34; Ariya asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely.&#34; I said, giving her one last kiss before I left.</p>
