                <p>*Ariya*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan. It&#39;s Ryker. He&#39;s here.* I told Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear took hold of me as I stared into the face of this man. A face of a man that I shouldn&#39;t recognize but did because of my connection with Ivan. This man was an Enforcer and was able to break my mind if he wanted. I had plenty of memories open but most of the important ones were sealed. Drake had continued to add things to the lock that needed to be protected but we knew from experience that Ryker could still break the memory. It just wasn&#39;t a permanent thing. I wasn&#39;t sure what Ryker would see if he broke into the memories that Drake locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m on my way.* Ivan told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel his concern for me and his need to get to me quickly. But he was in Boss&#39; office. There wasn&#39;t much that he was going to be able to do. I felt Ivan&#39;s need to come save me grow. I felt his pull towards me. I knew he was being forced to stay by Boss. I wanted him not to worry but I couldn&#39;t control the fear I felt seeing Ryker in front of me.  I did my best to soothe Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan, I love you. It&#39;s going to be ok.* I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*No, Ari. Please. Do whatever you can to protect your mind. Reach out to Drake. I love you. Come back to me.* Ivan told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I severed the connection. I wasn&#39;t sure what I should do about Ryker being in the room. I decided to try to stall him for as long as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried controlling the fear but I was sure it still came through my voice. Ryker smirked at me and took a step closer. I growled in response and took a half step back, prepared to fight him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re scared of me already? I haven&#39;t even done anything yet.&#34; Ryker grinned wickedly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryker lunged across the room grabbing my head in both of his hands. I grabbed his hands growling viciously as my fangs came out and my eyes changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*DRAKE!* I screamed in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A Navi. Interesting.&#34; Ryker said, his eyes lighting up with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ari? What&#39;s wrong?* Drake asked urgently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ryker.* I told him and cut the connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was too late. Ryker invaded my mind and I didn&#39;t need Ryker getting to Drake. I screamed in pain as Ryker forced his way in. My hands fell from his and the strength started draining from me immediately. My vision blurred and I fell to my knees in front of Ryker. He held on trying to see what he was looking for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the door shut and a small scuffle. Someone else had to be in the room with Ryker and I. I wasn&#39;t sure who. Ryker let me go and I fell to the ground. My eyes fluttered closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is going on here?&#34; I heard a voice growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice. It was his voice. Ivan. I tried to force my eyes open and saw that someone else had been in the room with Ryker and I. Someone had Ivan from behind and was holding him tightly so he couldn&#39;t move. Ivan tried getting out of the other man&#39;s grip but couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ari!* Ivan pushed to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan, I* I started but didn&#39;t get a chance to finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Took you long enough to get here, kid.&#34; Ryker growled, grabbing hold of Ivan&#39;s head with his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan froze and his eyes went wide as Ryker invaded his mind. My adrenaline surged and I was able to pull myself up to be on my hands and knees. I looked up at Ivan, worried. Ryker and Ivan both gasped in pain as Ryker withdrew his hands from Ivan. Whatever Ryker tried to do, it didn&#39;t seem to work. I saw Ryker&#39;s eyes glow and the man that held onto Ivan had the same effect. Ivan&#39;s wolf eyes flashed at me triggering my eyes to flash as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of my memories came flooding into my mind instantly. I had no idea what was happening but I saw Ivan&#39;s hair change to his real hair color. The white tips formed and my eyes went wide. I had to get Ivan out of here somehow. I wasn&#39;t willing to lose him. I wasn&#39;t willing to risk him getting tortured. They were going to know that Ivan wasn&#39;t actually Justin. That he&#39;d been Ivan this whole time. That he infiltrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear took hold of me. Ryker seemed stunned for a moment and I took the opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan!* I shouted in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt him start to disappear from me and the panic hit me. I was not about to lose him. He didn&#39;t respond to me. I felt that his strength was gone and felt the darkness starting to engulf him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#34; I started to shout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hand wrapped around my mouth immediately, preventing me from screaming Ivan&#39;s name. I could feel Ivan falling into the darkness. I struggled against the hand but it didn&#39;t budge. Ryker had grabbed hold of me and wasn&#39;t letting me go. I struggled against his grasp but I was unsuccessful in freeing myself. Ryker was not a small man by any means. He was massive. At least compared to Ivan and I. While Ivan was a toned muscular build, Ryker was more on a muscular stocky side except he was taller which made him all the more intimidating. His arms were massive. He had wrapped one arm around me holding me to him and the other he wrapped around my mouth making sure I couldn&#39;t shout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zane.&#34; Ryker said to the man holding Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear took over me as I worried what was about to happen to Ivan. I couldn&#39;t lose him. So I decided to do the one thing that I knew I could do even in my situation. I let my eyes change and my fangs came out and I bit into Ryker&#39;s hand as hard as I could.</p>
