                <p>I stayed in Ivan&#39;s arms for a while. I felt comfortable there. Safe. Like everything was going to be ok in the end. No matter what was going on. Things were going to be ok. We would figure out how to keep moving forward no matter what. Ivan had his hand in my short black hair. He was moving his fingers, stretching them out and pulling them back in, in somewhat of a circular motion. It was like he was scratching my head and massaging it at the same time. It felt amazing. I could feel the sleep starting to come and claim me. I had been mentally drained since Keo and I had practiced swapping places for hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan just held me closely and continued his head scratches for me. I drifted off to sleep quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ari?&#34; Keo called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head snapped toward the sound of his voice, &#34;Keo?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we? What&#39;s going on?&#34; Keo asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around, I could see both of our minds in the area we were in and I had a feeling someone was about to come to us. A grin spread across my face making Keo look even more confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you fall asleep?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. I was really irritated and exhausted for some reason and then I sat down and next thing I know I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m guessing we&#39;re here to see someone. The only people I&#39;ve ever seen this way are Ivan&#39;s parents though. They might be coming to give us some advice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but why would Ivan&#39;s parents come visit us? Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;d love their input but they&#39;re both wolves, and Ivan&#39;s not even here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I giggled, &#34;I&#39;m sure he is. He can probably hear and see everything going on, but he might not be able to speak or let us know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan and I always have our minds connected. If I fall asleep he&#39;s still connected to my mind. He&#39;s still here. He saw one of my memories once.&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo looked at me shocked, &#34;That&#39;s kinda cool. Can you guys do anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can do a lot of things, Keo. They just have to learn.&#34; A familiar voice said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our eyes went wide. The voice was so familiar to us even though we hadn&#39;t heard it in over 14 years. We both spun around to see our Mom standing behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MOM!&#34; We both shouted running over to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We hugged her tightly while she squeezed us both back. I felt hot tears sting my eyes as the last memory I had of her was of her burning alive right in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Ariya, I&#39;m so sorry that&#39;s the last thing that happened.&#34; Mom said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo looked at me with wide eyes, &#34;That&#39;s the last thing you saw of Mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes went wide, &#34;You saw that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo nodded but didn&#39;t speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can see things from me like Ivan can.&#34; I gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kind of. Ariya, you and your brother are special. You are twins and extremely identical even though you are different genders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo and I grinned at each other. We didn&#39;t mind sharing similar features but we knew there were differences between us. But we liked being able to swap places and fool everyone. We had done it since we were little kids. Ivan was the only one that always knew the difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you are in your mind you both can share a memory. It happens in an instant and the information is transferred to each other automatically. You&#39;ve both been working on trying to actually swap places, right?&#34; Mom continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we just can&#39;t get the timing to happen instantly. There&#39;s too much that needs to happen and the lowest time that we can get it to is 5 minutes. If we&#39;re fighting, that&#39;s not going to work.&#34; Keo answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom smiled at us, &#34;You have to stop thinking of it in steps. It&#39;s a fluid motion. You need to master each step first and then start making it a fluid motion. Everything is connected. That&#39;s why, whether you realize it or not you have to touch before swapping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, so we actually HAVE to high five? We just did it because we always have.&#34; I said, shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you guys touch it is your mind touching. Just like now. You see a room but that&#39;s because you&#39;re putting it in a box.&#34; Mom explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So if we make our minds touch then we can actually pass the information over instantly?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. It will take some practice. You need to be thinking of the specific moment as you high five each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Usually we focus on pulling one another. Do we still need to do that?&#34; Keo asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now. It&#39;s like how Ariya and Ivan communicate. They no longer think about creating the connection, they just think of the thought they want to give each other and the connection automatically establishes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Ivan and I have been constantly working on making things happen instantly?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. The fight you both had, the steps you took to be able to find out that Boss has more than 1 ability. It only worked out so perfectly because you were using your Dragon&#39;s Eye and your minds were connected.&#34; Mom answered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya and Ivan, they&#39;re more connected than we are, right?&#34; Keo asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right, Keothi. It will continue that way since they are mate bonded. But you and your sister are also very closely connected. So by default, you and Ivan are connected in a different way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Keo, unsure of where he was going with it. But as the wheels turned in his head I began to see what he was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t really think&#34; I started but stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo grinned at me, &#34;I do think. You told Drake that you both can share each other&#39;s abilities. What if you and Ivan can swap places too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s still more. Think further.&#34; Mom encouraged us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Mom, putting what she was saying together, &#34;Are you saying that Keo and I can swap places because we&#39;re twins, but because Ivan and I are mate bonded we can also swap? So by default, Keo and Ivan should be able to swap places as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile spread across our Mom&#39;s face, &#34;Something like that. Each swap will be different. You&#39;ll have to get used to each other and figure out how to do it. But with enough practice I&#39;m sure you will all be able to figure it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t keep trying the exact same thing each time. We&#39;ll need to adjust it to get it figured out. You and Ivan should be able to practice a little on your own. Get him used to swapping. It&#39;s probably going to be a lot weirder for him than it is for us.&#34; Keo said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will. I wonder if he and I swap if that means other things open up too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll find out, Ariya. Time is running out. I have to go. I love you both so very much, and know that I am proud of you both. I&#39;m proud of you and Ivan too, Ariya. There is a long road ahead, but as long as you all work together, you can handle it.&#34; Mom told Keo and I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss you, Mom.&#34; Keo said, hugging her tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! Mom, Boss said that you were still alive. Is that true? Where are you?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Ari. I can&#39;t answer that. I&#39;m basically a piece that was left behind in Ivan when I saved a part of his parents in him. The only reason I can come to you now is because you and Ivan are still connected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tears formed in my eyes, &#34;Am I going to see you again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom pulled Keo and I in tightly, &#34;Yes, Ari. You and your brother will see me again. I just don&#39;t have any more time this time. If I am still alive, you&#39;ll find me. I&#39;m sure of it. Tell Caleb, Drake, and Ivan that I say hi and I love them as well. You all need to stay together and work together. You can do this. Always remember, that I love you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you.&#34; I told Mom, burying my head into her, squeezing her tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you.&#34; Keo said, hugging her tightly as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been so long since we&#39;d seen her. I missed her so much. The pain I felt from losing her that night was unbearable. Drake had locked the memory but the pain of it still remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let the pain consume you, Ariya. You are strong and beautiful. You can overcome any obstacle. Even if I&#39;m not here. Remember, you&#39;re not alone. You are never alone now. Besides, you might have to do a little work but there&#39;s some help that is going to show up at some point down the road.&#34; Mom said, winking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll remember.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind began to wonder who might be there to help us eventually but I was sure that we would find out or figure it out when the time came. For now we needed to do what we had planned, to focus on the step immediately in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keo, things that didn&#39;t work very easily for you should start working easier now. Because you both turned now, things will work easier for you. I know your road hasn&#39;t been easy. But learn what you can. Don&#39;t let your past hold you back. Either of you. You have a strength in you, Keo. You can activate it. Just believe in yourself like I do.&#34; Mom told Keo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will.&#34; Keo said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget, I love you both.&#34;</p>
