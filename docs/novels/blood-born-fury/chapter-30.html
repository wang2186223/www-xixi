                <p>*Caleb*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Ariya went to report to Boss, Drake worked on locking my memories for the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are we going to do about your memories on the plan?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can lock my memories as well. But once I do, I won&#39;t be able to unlock them by myself. I can create a couple different keys for it if need be though. That way we can get it back sooner if needed. I did make it to where it&#39;s not constantly locked on us though. If it&#39;s just the 3 of us, well 5 if we find Ivan and Keo, we should have complete access to the memories, only as long as no one else is around us. So if someone else is there, it&#39;s gone. We&#39;re all aware that the memories are locked. Otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be an instant delivery system.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, &#34;Could you imagine how terrifying that would be? Something happens and in the middle of it you get slapped with a bunch of memories that you had no recollection of and now suddenly you have to follow the memories without question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake laughed with me, &#34;It would be like running through a minefield with a blindfold on and everytime you hear an explosion a little piece of the puzzle comes in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake finished sealing both of our memories. He looked exhausted and hungry. I walked over to him and held my wrist up to him. He looked at me unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya already said she didn&#39;t mind. Besides I&#39;m sure Ivan would do the same, though I still don&#39;t really remember him, and I&#39;m sure Keo won&#39;t mind either. I don&#39;t mind. You&#39;re the only one unsure here.&#34; I teased him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just don&#39;t really have time, that&#39;s all.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can bite my neck,&#34; I laughed at him, &#34;I just didn&#39;t know how to offer for you to feed on me by doing that. What should I do? Throw my body at you. That seems a little intimate, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake started laughing so hard tears came out of his eyes. &#34;Yeah probably don&#39;t do that. I&#39;ll be so confused if you did that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got control of ourselves from laughing, Drake fed quickly. We didn&#39;t have much time so we had to get moving. When he was done we left the house and took up our position and hid, waiting as the plan began to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I know that I can&#39;t die from Ariya, or Keo apparently, feeding on me since we&#39;re bonded but can I die from you feeding on me?&#34; I asked Drake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you can&#39;t. You and I are bonded just indirectly. I think that&#39;s actually what is going on with you and Ariya. But I&#39;m not sure. You both basically bonded like normal. If something were to happen to Ariya or Keo, you would still live on but your bond could be transferred to me or the other&#34; Drake trailed off...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw where Drake&#39;s mind went. &#34;Keo is ok, he&#39;s alive. He has to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake shook the thoughts from his head, &#34;The same thing goes with Ariya, Keo, me and Ivan. You both are the last original Navi wolves. You are the last ones that can bond with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish we had more time.&#34; I thought out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too. We needed to work on communicating with each other from further away. You and I should work on it more when we have time. Especially if we can get Keothi back.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah we need to. But at least you were able to get through a couple times. Ariya should recognize it&#39;s you when you push. Have you tried pushing now?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I have a feeling I shouldn&#39;t try. Especially right now. We don&#39;t know what plan we&#39;re going with. Until we know, it&#39;s better not to take unnecessary chances. If we&#39;re going with the primary plan we&#39;ll get a chance to try more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah but more than likely it&#39;s going to be plan B.&#34; I said, feeling nauseous again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate plan B.&#34; Drake growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Agreed. Plan B sucks. But we needed to be prepared. The most important things were done this morning before she left. That&#39;s what mattered. That&#39;s what is going to make plan B actually work.&#34; I said, trying to convince myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still hate plan B.&#34;  Drake said, stubbornly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A side door to the building Ariya worked in opened quickly. Keo. He fell down the steps. Cursing, he got up quickly and ran to the door as it shut closed on him. He banged on the door shouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya!&#34; Keo shouted, punching the door in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach churned. Guess she shoved him out the door. That should mean Plan B.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo cursed angrily, &#34;Fine Ariya. This time. Only this time. Never again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo took off down the road in search of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go, I&#39;ll keep watching. Just in case.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;1 minute Drake, no longer. Stick to the plan.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake nodded. My body shivered and I shifted into my wolf form and ran after Keo. As I edged closer to him something felt off. I decided to follow for a second when I realized what was bugging me. I ran ahead and jumped out in front of Keo. Keo stopped in his tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me, his expression sad, &#34;Caleb&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled viciously towards him, showing my teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo looked at me confused, his confusion quickly turning to anger, &#34;I didn&#39;t want to leave her. She literally shoved me out of the door Caleb. You think I&#39;d want to leave her. Again?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped my jaw towards him, growling. Keo narrowed his eyes looking at me. As the pieces connected in his head, his eyes changed color and his fangs came out. Just looking at him, I could tell he was hungry.  I lunged in his direction. He didn&#39;t move. Just held his ground and let me lunge toward him. The Shadow appeared from the ground lunging back at me, knife in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadows. I tried to push the thought to Drake but it was too late. 11 of them appeared from all over surrounding Keothi and I.</p>
