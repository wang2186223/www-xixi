                <p>*Ariya*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan and I had figured out as many possible twists and turns and problems that could come up. Once we were satisfied we started planning. It took a few hours to come up with different plans and as we came up with plans new problems popped up. We worked out as much as we could with the information that we had while Keo, Drake, and Caleb did the same on their end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ari, I know that we want to savor the time we have together right now since we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen&#34; Ivan trailed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think we should try to sleep to try to get some more memories back?&#34; I asked, picking up where he left off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. We don&#39;t know if some missing piece is going to be given in the next memory.&#34; Ivan said, looking at the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held his face in my hands and gently kissed him on the lips, &#34;We will have time. But I think you&#39;re right. The question is, who goes to sleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it needs to be you, Ari. If I go to sleep and Boss comes in here before you can wake me up, we&#39;re in deep trouble. But if you go to sleep and they come in here, they won&#39;t think anything of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think that&#39;s the safer option but it might be worth the risk to have you go to sleep. The problem we&#39;re talking about is about you shifting which means that your memories are more important than mine at this moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan sighed, &#34;That&#39;s true, but I have a feeling if I go to sleep I might end up shifting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him, concerned, &#34;What makes you think that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The first time I shifted, I was asleep. That&#39;s how it works. I haven&#39;t shifted in 14 years. I got fragments of memories before last night happened. But last night, that was when I got a lot more of my memories back. When I remembered about the night of the attack and that I was the wolf that I was seeing in my memories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan, I think you need to shift willingly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan cocked his head at me, &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said the first time that you shifted, you shifted in your sleep right? Because we&#39;re worried about you shifting again since it&#39;s been 14 years and we don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll be able to shift back immediately, I think it&#39;s because you need to shift willingly. I think if your body shifts on its own I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be able to shift back. But if you shift willingly, I think you&#39;ll be able to shift back as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know how I know, but something&#39;s telling me you&#39;re right. We should run it by Drake and see what he thinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to contact them in a couple hours. Should I try sleeping then or are you going to?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you need to. It&#39;s the safest option and I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ll be able to fall asleep.&#34; Ivan winked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think it&#39;s ok for me to fall asleep on you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think so. I can hear if someone is coming and I can get up and move if I need to. Besides, if you just lay in my lap I can move you off faster if I need to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved to rest my head in Ivan&#39;s lap. I had shorter hair for a couple reasons. For one it was easier to maintain working in the field we did. Another reason was because I didn&#39;t have to worry about someone trying to use the length of my hair against me in a fight. And lastly, though I didn&#39;t totally remember at first, it was because Keo and I looked so much alike when we used to &#34;Switch&#34; with each other no one would tell based on the length of our hair. They had to find other clues that we had switched. Ivan ran his hands through the top of my hair and at the back, scratching my head. I&#39;m pretty sure I fell asleep within 5 seconds of laying my head in his lap. Just like we predicted, another memory came to the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>- -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I was laying on my side, facing the door, asleep when a pair of blue glowing eyes came up to me. A soft whine and a cold nose nudged me. I opened my eyes slowly just wanting to go back to sleep. I heard the soft whine again, almost like a cry. A beautiful black wolf with white tips throughout his fur and glowing blue eyes stood in front of me. This wolf was larger than what a regular wolf was but it was not as big as the other wolves in our village. The Navi wolves were massive but this wolf was smaller than them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan.&#34; I breathed and the wolf whined softly again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure how I knew but I knew. It was Ivan. He must have shifted for the first time. I reached my hand out while still half asleep and touched the top of his head and scratched. Ivan whined again. He was scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m really sleepy. Your fur is really soft though. It&#39;s like a pillow.&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan put his front two massive paws on my bed. I moved so he could get up and he laid down. I put my head on shoulder and my hand back on his head, scratching it softly. I fell asleep again quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up with a start to Mom busting into the room, &#34;Ariya, have you seen Ivan?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw Ivan in wolf form and breathed a sigh of relief, &#34;Oh thank goodness. Are you ok?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m fine, he came in last night, he was scared. Please don&#39;t be mad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh sweetie, I&#39;m not mad, I was so worried. I went to wake you guys up and when I opened Ivan&#39;s roomwell his room was torn to pieces and I was worried when I couldn&#39;t find him. Oh, and for the record, I was asking if Ivan was ok. You look like you got the best sleep of your life, Ari.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Mom confused, then realized I had drooled all over Ivan. My hands went to my mouth and my cheeks went red in embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Ivan!&#34; I cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom laughed, &#34;It only ever happens when you sleep really well. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s mad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan leaned his head against me to let me know he was ok and wasn&#39;t upset about it. I wrapped my arms around him giving him a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time to get ready for the day. I&#39;ll tell your grandfather that we need to have Derek come over to help Ivan out. Ivan, if you don&#39;t mind coming with me, it will be easier to just walk up to Drake than trying to explain everything. And Drake will be able to see if we can&#39;t figure out how to communicate with you since you can&#39;t actually talk right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, is Ivan going to be like that for a while?&#34; I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think so, sweetie. Only time will tell. Unfortunately we don&#39;t know until we know who is an original Navi wolf. There are very few of them left and they don&#39;t appear that often.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The gene doesn&#39;t pass down well. Ivan and Caleb are distant cousins and there is a likelihood that they are but we can&#39;t be sure until they shift for the first time and then shift back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. Is that why their parents were killed when they were about Keo and I&#39;s age?&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sweetie. Unfortunately the world knows that we coexist together and so they tried to wipe out the original wolves and as many of the other wolves as they could find since they&#39;re a lot easier to kill than we are. That&#39;s why Ivan and Caleb do a lot of training. As of right now there&#39;s only 3 original Navi wolves left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There will be 5 if Ivan and Caleb are original Navi wolves right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom laughed, &#34;Yes, that&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the ground, suddenly worried. Ivan nudged me and whined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong, sweetie?&#34; Mom asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan&#39;s not going to have to leave since he shifted right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not. Ivan and Caleb are both here to stay. No matter what. Whether they&#39;re original Navi wolves or not. This is their home now. It has been since they both lost their parents. That said, Ivan we&#39;re going to have to get new things for your room now, but we can figure that out later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I beamed up at her. Ivan, Caleb, Keo, and I were the best of friends. I also had the biggest crush on Ivan as Keo teased me about on numerous occasions. But always when Ivan and Caleb weren&#39;t around. Ivan was the oldest out of the 4 of us, then it was Caleb and then Keo and I. Caleb and Ivan always looked out for us but we were all friends and cared a lot about each other. Keo used to tell me that Ivan loved me which only made me red. I wasn&#39;t sure I believed him but I wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, Ariya, time to get ready. Ivan, let&#39;s you and I go find Drake. Think you can find him with your nose?&#34; Mom grinned.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-  -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up slowly, feeling Ivan&#39;s hand still running through my hair giving me head scratches. As I was remembering my dream I suddenly became self conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan noticed me stir awake and laughed softly, &#34;I think I need to have a towel to catch your drool, princess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was mortified. Absolutely mortified.</p>
