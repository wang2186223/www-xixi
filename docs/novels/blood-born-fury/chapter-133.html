                <p>Ryker had put his hand around my mouth, preventing me from screaming Ivan&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zayne.&#34; Ryke said to the man that was still holding onto Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zayne sniffed the air and nodded at Ryker. The fear had taken over me as I felt Ivan slip further away from me. I let my eyes change and my fangs came out and I bit into Ryker&#39;s hand as hard as I could. Ryker roared in pain, ripping his hand away from my mouth and letting me go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zayne, let him go.&#34; Ryker ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zayne immediately let go of Ivan and I lunged at Ivan, catching him before he hit the ground. Ivan was really weak and I could feel him slipping away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan!&#34; I said urgently to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan didn&#39;t move so I did the one thing I knew would work. I bit into my own tongue and then kissed him, pushing my tongue into his mouth. Ivan jolted awake, his hand immediately pulling me closer to him. Zayne&#39;s eyes went wide as he watched what I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan!* I shouted in our mind as the tears began to burn my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It&#39;s ok, Ari. I&#39;m ok. We&#39;re ok. We* Ivan started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low growl came from behind us. I pulled away from Ivan and spun toward the growl. I bared my fangs growling at Ryker. Ryker growled back, baring his own fangs at me. My eyes went wide with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit! Get away from him!&#34; Zayne shouted at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zayne jumped in the way and quickly took a blade and pressed it to his neck drawing blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ryker! Focus on me! I&#39;m right here. Come and get it.&#34; Zayne said, cocking his head to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryker looked feral. Like he hadn&#39;t fed in a long time. Zayne&#39;s actions pulled my attention to him, specifically his neck. My breathing picked up as I saw the blood start to run down Zayne&#39;s neck. I felt my tongue move back and forth across my teeth as they pushed their way out into fangs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ari?&#34; Ivan shook my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were locked onto Zayne&#39;s neck. A growl came out of me and Zayne looked back. The sudden movement caught Ryker&#39;s attention finally and Ryker lunged at Zayne. He wrapped his hand around Zayne&#39;s throat and sank his fangs deep into Zayne&#39;s neck. Zayne gasped and I felt like I was being pulled towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she new, Ivan?&#34; Zayne asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Ivan answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to get her attention. She needs to feed. It&#39;s Ryker, he&#39;s pulling her into a frenzy.&#34; Zayne instructed Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Ivan pull at my face but I wouldn&#39;t turn to him. I was being called to sink my own fangs into Zayne&#39;s neck. I watched as Ryker fed. He fed like he couldn&#39;t get enough. Like he&#39;d been starving and was finally given a bit of food. Even as he fully drained Zayne, he continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come back to me, princess.&#34; Ivan whispered to me softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan took my face in his hands and kissed me. He showed me his wolf eyes which pulled my attention back to him slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There you go. Come back to me, princess. I need you to feed from me.&#34; Ivan whispered, cocking his head to the side while pulling me to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes shifted to Ivan&#39;s neck and a growl came from me. I was hit with a memory of what it felt like to feed on Ivan. Ivan pushed the memory to me, coaxing me to him. I growled in response and quickly pulled him to me, sinking my fangs into his neck. It was intoxicating. The taste of Ivan&#39;s blood gushed into my mouth. I felt my eyes roll back as I was hit with the pleasure I felt from feeding from Ivan. Ivan wrapped his arms around me, holding me close to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ryker*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in me snapped. Ariya had bit my hand drawing blood. That was the first issue. Then she bit her own tongue and fed the blood to Ivan. That was when I lost it. I couldn&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;d fed. I had locked Zayne and I&#39;s memories so we couldn&#39;t get caught. We very rarely had moments when we were ourselves. It wasn&#39;t that we weren&#39;t ourselves. It wasn&#39;t that we went by different names. But we couldn&#39;t remember being an Original Navi Wolf or a Blood Born Navi. If anyone was around we didn&#39;t know. People have been around us a lot over the last few months. So neither of us remembered. Until we got called back to the office. Boss needed us for a special assignment. He said my old protégé, Justin, needed some special training and had found out something that Boss didn&#39;t want anyone to know. He also said that Justin&#39;s protégé, Ariya, had also learned something. But she would intrigue me. He didn&#39;t give me that many details. Not until we got here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zayne and I met with Boss after he left the office last night. He let me know what he wanted destroyed in their minds. But told me that we should swing by and meet Ariya first. I didn&#39;t expect everything to happen the way it did. I tried entering Ariya&#39;s mind and anything of importance was already locked. Most likely by Drake. The lock was familiar to me. It wasn&#39;t until Justin walked in and I tried to enter his mind that everything flooded back. I locked his mind more to protect him and bring my own memories back if needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t expecting the hunger I was going to feel. I definitely wasn&#39;t expecting the sudden need to feed from Zayne while we were in the facility. I thought I&#39;d be able to hold it off until we could leave for a moment. I didn&#39;t realize that Ariya was going to be the reason I fell into a frenzy. The reason I lost control so quickly. But now there was more of a problem. Ariya was a prisoner here. Ivan knew who he was, which was made clear to me the second I entered his mind. Ivan and Ariya are mated which means they&#39;re not going to leave without the other. Now Zayne and I were in the middle of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to figure things out quickly. But I needed to buy some time. Time to be able to talk to both of them. Time to talk to Drake as well. I wasn&#39;t sure if he was around but I would guess he would be. After draining Zayne multiple times, I finally started to get a grip on reality again. I released him, healed him and then turned to look at Ariya and Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What am I going to do with you 2?&#34; I growled.</p>
