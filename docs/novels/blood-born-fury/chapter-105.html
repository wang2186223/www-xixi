                <p>*Ivan*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hair changed color again and I felt something was different just like the last time. I wasn&#39;t sure what it was but I would need to figure it out. Something was different and it was bugging me. I opened the door to the building and was greeted by security in the usual manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, sir.&#34; The guard said, acknowledging me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning.&#34; I grunted at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked through the front and headed to where Ariya was at. The light was off so I went to my office to put the food in the fridge. I would reheat it later. I looked at all the reports and filed them accordingly. Checked to see if there was anything that needed my attention. All the work I had took me less than 15 minutes to complete. Everything typically went through Boss. There were minor things that I would need to look at but Boss usually had people in the field or in training. There was no reason for anyone to be behind a desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss would be in, in about 10 minutes. I got up and went to his office to wait outside for him to arrive. 10 minutes later Boss showed up. Right on schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still asleep?&#34; Boss asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup. I think she&#39;s starting to get into a routine of sleeping until 7am.&#34; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about you? Is the boredom killing you yet?&#34; Boss asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked, &#34;Only a little. The other day was fun though. Jess was whiter than a ghost and I think Adam got the message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know about that. They&#39;re scared of you but they still think that they&#39;re right. I think it&#39;s time to show them just how powerful Ariya is now. She was stronger than them before but they all still seemed to have some complex, thinking if it really came down to it they would win simply because most of them activated their abilities and because Ariya is a girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snorted a laugh, &#34;They&#39;re only scared of me because of you. None of them have seen me fight or fought me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss smirked, &#34;Not just because of me. You have that killer aura and the angry face to match it. It&#39;s true that they don&#39;t believe you&#39;re actually as much of a threat as you seem to be but that&#39;s because your ability is simply to track people. Maybe it&#39;s time we show them the only person capable of being in charge of watching Ariya is you. Think you can handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Handle what? Fighting her? What do you have in mind?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need them to see how powerful Ariya has become since activating her ability. There&#39;s an arena that I&#39;ve had people build for her. Since Ariya has been cooperative, I&#39;ve decided to test her abilities in that arena so she stands a fighting chance.&#34; Boss told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t she going to get stronger that way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More than likely. But as she gets stronger, so will the others. Which will ultimately make it easier to catch Drake in the long run. I want you to be the one to fight her the most. You&#39;re the strongest out of everyone here and the only one capable of tracking Drake. Making Ariya stronger is the only way to truly test the limits of their abilities and see what the true weaknesses are. Remember Ariya is a baby compared to Drake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, &#34;Ariya is just the stepping stone. Drake is the goal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. That said, Justin, Ariya is not going to be easy to fight now. Especially when you give her enough blood to fight at full strength. Think you can handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to give her enough blood to be at full strength for this fight?&#34; I asked, intrigued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the only way to truly prove a point to the others. You better be ready for it.&#34; Boss told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can handle it.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, because they&#39;re not the only ones that need to make sure they know their place. You need to make sure you practically break Ariya. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll start around noon. You can give her breakfast and get her number down to 2 for blood. The arena is in the middle of the building. Make sure you both are there by noon. Oh and Justin, just walk her there. Don&#39;t put on any restraints unless you think she won&#39;t cooperate. I think she will though.&#34; Boss told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised an eyebrow at him, &#34;To add fear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. Everyone will be at the arena. Including the guards.&#34; Boss said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is gonna be fun.&#34; I smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get too excited. You still have to win and it&#39;s not going to be easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll win.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left Boss&#39;s office, grabbed the food, a few blood bags, then headed to Ariya. As I walked in the room I felt my hair change back and my memories came out of the darkness. The concern hit me as I thought about the conversation I just had with Boss. My body shivered and my eyes changed to my wolf eyes. The anger took hold of me as I stared at the ground. I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan? What happened?&#34; Ariya asked, catching my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze shifted to her and I instantly started to calm down. I set everything down and walked over to her. I pulled her into my arms and breathed in her scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a problem.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; She asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have a lot of time. I was with Boss for too long. You need to eat and feed fast.&#34; I told her, taking her face gently in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed Ariya deeply letting my mind connect back to hers. I could feel her hunger bubbling up to the surface so I pulled away from her and took my shirt off quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think you can tell me what&#39;s going on while I feed?&#34; Ariya asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have long. It&#39;s probably better if you focus on going faster and then while you eat the regular food I tell you. Or show you. Besides, we need to know in case there&#39;s an emergency how fast you can feed.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan, you&#39;re starting to worry me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s going to be ok, princess. No matter what.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was bugging me. Deep down. There was more to this whole thing than I knew. I couldn&#39;t put my finger on what it was and we didn&#39;t have time to waste. Especially if we wanted to talk about it. Ariya put a barrier up and I looked at her confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No secrets, Ivan. Not from me.&#34; She growled at me.</p>
