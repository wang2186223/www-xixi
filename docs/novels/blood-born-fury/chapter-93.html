                <p>*Ivan*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost lost all self control I had. I wanted to bury myself in her, literally and figuratively. I pulled her closely, breathing in her scent. I felt like I couldn&#39;t get close enough to her. She had wrapped her arms around me as I had done to her. Both of us felt like we needed each other as close as possible right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t how I wanted to do this, princess.&#34; I said, while I kissed her softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have much of a choice now do we? I mean if you want we can try to escape but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s going to be the most difficult thing to do, it being the beginning of the day and all.&#34; Ariya giggled trying to make light of our situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze instantly as the words sank in and Ariya did too. We had gotten caught up in the moment without realizing what time it was. Everyone was coming in right now and the amount of movement in the facility was going to be at its peak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cursed as I pulled away from her a bit, &#34;Ari, we can&#39;t do this right now. The likelihood that we get caught now is so much higher than if we wait until tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari cursed, &#34;You&#39;re right. Ugh! I wish we could just pretend that I was sleeping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at her, &#34;Ari, you&#39;re a genius.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am?&#34; She asked, surprised at my sudden excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Boss&#39;s whole point of giving you a mattress, a blanket, a pillow, and more food had a lot to do with him wanting to make you sleep more. He&#39;ll do anything to get your memories back faster. It means there&#39;s a reason to have the light out in this room. Even though I&#39;m supposed to be here watching.&#34; I grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, but I&#39;m pretty sure turning the light out isn&#39;t going to help keep them from noticing any sounds that happen.&#34; Ariya laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The room is mostly sound proof. Only extremely loud noises can even be heard. Boss doesn&#39;t like anyone knowing more than he wants them to so all the rooms are sound proof. That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t hear anything but unless someone is screaming or something no one can hear anything unless they were in here or right outside. But it doesn&#39;t matter because you can put a barrier up like we did when we were worried about my wolf howling. That makes it to where no one can hear. Your ability works for us because it&#39;s black. If your energy manipulation was a different color it would be a problem but it&#39;s black. It works in our favor.&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s you who&#39;s the genius here.&#34; Ari laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, princess. That&#39;s still you. You&#39;re just rubbing off on me. Don&#39;t forget this whole plan of revenge is yours. The rest of us are along for the ride. We do have to take care of a couple things first before we do anything.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ari nodded, putting the pieces together, &#34;We need to make sure Boss isn&#39;t going to come in here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which means I need to go check in with him. I need to tell him that you didn&#39;t seem to want to get up. I need to tell him that you got another memory back, even if he comes in here for a minute to talk to you.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You also need to make sure that it looks like the light is out if the barrier is up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have to leave twice then. The first time so I can check in with Boss. You&#39;ll have to actually turn the light out, just in case he comes back with me. The second time, put the barrier up so I can make sure it looks like the light is out with the barrier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It sounds pretty solid but how do you plan on managing to leave the room twice?&#34; Ariya asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well the first time can be to just report to Boss. The second time can be when I leave to go get you lunch.&#34; I grinned at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like this plan.&#34; Ariya told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took her face gently in my hands and locked eyes with her, &#34;Ari, are you absolutely sure this is what you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More than anything. Are you sure?&#34; She told me and I could tell she had no hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely. I need you to do something for me though. I need you to reach out to Drake. I need him to adjust the lock a little bit again.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me confused, &#34;Is everything ok?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I just want to make sure that I won&#39;t lose my memories in the middle of it if someone gets too close to the door. Your consent and our mate bond is with me. Not with Justin.&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya&#39;s face went pale, &#34;I don&#39;t want to risk that happening. I only want this you. Not with Justin. I know you&#39;re kind of the same person but you&#39;re also not. I don&#39;t hate you as Justin, but I&#39;m in love with you as Ivan. Not Justin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t let that happen. That&#39;s why I need to talk to Drake when I leave the second time. He needs to adjust the lock so that if I&#39;m ever in a dome that you created and it&#39;s just the 2 of us I won&#39;t lose my memories. Only if another person is in the dome with us should I not have my memories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So if someone comes into the room then?&#34; Ariya asked, worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll just have to pretend to fight like we did the last time. I can say you woke up that way and lost control and we can blame it on your memories. Boss should be willing to let it slide. Especially because he believes that I have the upper hand fighting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean you pretty much do have the upper hand. You&#39;ve been trained in all the different forms of combat there is. I&#39;m pretty sure there are very few people that can actually beat you in hand to hand combat.&#34; Ariya laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like I told Drake, if he used his ability he would have taken me down easily.&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fair but I&#39;m not Drake. I don&#39;t have complete control over my abilities like he does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will. I&#39;ll help teach you how to fight and Drake will teach you about controlling it in the way that he can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll be able to use my ability too.&#34; Ariya pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you&#39;ll get to teach me how instead.&#34; I said grinning at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya&#39;s face lit up in excitement at being able to teach me how to use her abilities. The truth was, I was excited to learn. My parents said that we would be able to bring each other up to a new level and with the potential threat of the Enforcers when we escaped, I knew that we would need it. Drake was strong but I wasn&#39;t confident that he would be able to beat the Enforcers without suffering a massive amount of damage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to make sure that Ariya was going to be ok throughout all of it. I needed to make sure I taught her everything I knew. If we couldn&#39;t beat Boss we wouldn&#39;t be able to get out of here. I wanted us to be able to leave as soon as we needed to. Without hesitation. Without fear that we wouldn&#39;t make it out. Right now, we wouldn&#39;t be able to make it out. I wanted us to be able to make it out even if we were to leave with everyone here. I didn&#39;t want to question it and I was sure that Ari felt the same and that was why she stayed.</p>
