                <p>&#34;Ariya, stop!&#34; Drake growled through gritted teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d caught the scent of blood in the air and was following it. I knew what my body needed and I couldn&#39;t resist the urge to go and get it. I didn&#39;t understand why Drake wanted me to stop. Didn&#39;t he need it too? So why was he fighting his hunger and me with it? Whatever. The smell was calling me. Begging me to come and get it. So I ignored Drake and kept heading toward the all too familiar scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake ran up in front of me, turned and grabbed me by the shoulders, halting my movement. He continued to struggle to stay in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t the right way.&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes it is. Can&#39;t you smell it in the air?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath in through my nose, closing my eyes. I let it escape out of my mouth in a growl. I could only imagine how it would feel to drink for the first time. I opened my eyes and saw Drake struggling to maintain control even more after my previous action. Drake grit his teeth, his body tensing. He gripped my shoulders incredibly hard as if it would help him from losing control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Drake rammed me into a boulder. The rough edges bit into my back. I growled. In response, Drake grabbed my face, growling at me. There was something wet on his hand. It was on my cheek and at the corner of my mouth. I stared at Drake puzzled. He winced in pain unsure of why there was pain in his hand. That&#39;s when it hit me. He cut his hand. It was blood that was on me. My breathing quickened as I realized. Now I was the one trying to resist but the urge was too great. Just one taste. That&#39;s all I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya, no!&#34; Drake said as if he could read my mind. Drake went to pull his hand away but I caught it and licked my lips in anticipation, catching some blood on my tongue. I rolled it around in my mouth. It was like a drug. Like I instantly became high and had to keep going to maintain the feeling. Drake ripped away from my grasp. A primal type of growl came out of me. I tensed up and struck, slamming Drake into a boulder of his own. I sank my fangs into Drake&#39;s jugular. Drake growled angrily at me in response. I couldn&#39;t stop myself. Drake tried fighting back but the strength was draining out of him. He grunted as he slid to the ground. I took a deep breath in as I drank. Catching the scent I had been chasing before, I released Drake and continued my pursuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I ran chasing the scent, I realized someone was following me. Ignoring them I kept going. They caught up to me and tackled me. I growled as I looked to see who it was. Drake, and he looked like he didn&#39;t have anymore control like he&#39;d given in to his primal side. Drake and I struggled with each other and rolled down a rocky hill. We struggled fighting one another until we landed in a small clearing breaking apart from one another. The air whooshed out of us when we landed. As I pushed up on all fours, I took a breath and froze. The scent I&#39;d been chasing was here. I let out a growl and licked my lips. I caught more of Drake&#39;s blood on me. I began losing it. I breathed in and could feel my body beginning to move against my will. I growled more as my tongue moved across my fangs. As I stood a growl came from behind me. My body whirled around and my heart sank. A gasp escaped from Link and Mya as they saw me. Caleb growled in wolf form, knowing I wasn&#39;t in control. I growled in response to Caleb and barred my fangs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A growl from my left responded back. As Drake stood up I could see he regained some control but it would break soon. Sensing this, Caleb started morphing back. Drake lunged at me but I side stepped him and lunged at Caleb. Caleb grunted as he landed and slid across the ground. Mya screamed and I froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya! Stop!&#34; Caleb shouted desperately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I want to but I can&#39;t do anything to stop myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya! If you don&#39;t stop, you could kill them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed in place frozen after hearing Mya scream. Every part of me, fighting an internal battle. My body wanted to feed. Needed to. But my heart wanted to protect my friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it, Ariya. Keep fighting. You can do this.&#34; Caleb encouraged me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb&#34; I forced out, gaining some control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m right here, Ariya. Keep fighting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calebyou have to knock us out.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb looked at Drake understandingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know how much longer&#34; Drake trailed off. He noticed the blood coming from Caleb. Drake&#39;s body tensed and he growled ready to strike. Caleb cursed, knowing that if Drake attacked I would too. Sounds escaped me as I grit my teeth, trying to resist my urge to attack. Drake didn&#39;t wait any longer. He struck at Caleb sinking his fangs into Caleb&#39;s neck. Mya screamed in fear, setting me off. I grabbed my head with my hands. Growling I tried hard to resist. Caleb gasped as Drake fed on him. I cried out trying to resist but the urge overcame me and I tensed up, licking my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Ariya! Stop!&#34; Mya shouted running to me. Before I moved she grabbed hold of me. I growled in response, looking down at her. I remembered how I felt about her. Like she was a little sister that I wanted to protect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya! Please! Don&#39;t do this! This isn&#39;t how it&#39;s supposed to go. Please, Ariya! Stop! Please!&#34; Mya pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world around me started fading out. The strength drained out of me. I collapsed onto the ground. Unsure of what just happened, when Mya grabbed me. As the world faded out, Caleb started falling to the ground. His strength drained from him as well.</p>
