                <p>*Ariya*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about everything that Keo and I had done up to this point. We had high fived everytime to swap places. How we always ended up in the room that was split between our minds. We would have to verbally tell each other the questions being asked and answered on each side. It was starting to make me mentally exhausted to continue swapping. We had been at it for a couple hours easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snuggled closer to Ivan. I really just wanted to stay right here at this moment. To be close to him and not practice anymore. I knew we needed to but I was frustrated and I was getting moody. I didn&#39;t want to keep at it. I didn&#39;t want to continue to stay stuck in the same spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Maybe that&#39;s part of the problem, Ari. It looks like you guys have just continued trying the same thing. The way that you guys have been doing it seems to take at least 5 minutes. What do you think about when you pull Keo to you?* Ivan asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I think about pulling him to my mind. What it looks like inside and all that.* I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Maybe that&#39;s part of the issue. What if you just pull Keo? Don&#39;t worry about what it looks like, it&#39;s already been solidified. Just pull at him.* Ivan suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*That might make it a little quicker. The biggest problem is us exchanging information.* I grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*So what&#39;s the fastest way to get information?* Ivan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Seeing it I guess. Hearing it is slow and reading is even worse. So I guess seeing it?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*So what if when you guys try to swap you think about what you need Keo to know? Do you think that would work?* Ivan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Possibly. I think it is a lot to try to make it appear on a screen in my mind. I wish there was a way I could just give him the information by touching him. Like when we high fived if the information was just basically downloaded to him.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan raised an eyebrow at me, *Maybe you can do that, princess. Right now you guys have been talking but what if when you pull each other you try to remember the information that needs to be transferred. When you make contact with each other you give the memory to him.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I don&#39;t see how that would end up working. But we could try. If we can&#39;t make this an instant thing, it&#39;s not going to be usable.* I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You&#39;ll figure it out, Ari. I know you can. You figure everything out. How about you feed first and then I can get some food for you and you can eat?* Ivan offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to feed or eat. I did but I didn&#39;t. I just wanted to be in Ivan&#39;s arms. I didn&#39;t want to leave this spot. I just wanted to curl up and take a nap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*We can do that if you want, Ari.* Ivan said, nuzzling his head into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*That&#39;s what I&#39;d really like. I don&#39;t want you to leave just yet. I just don&#39;t want to leave this spot.* I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*We can&#39;t practice all day every day. You all will need your rest. How about just reaching out to Drake and letting him know it&#39;s time to stop for the day? That we can try again in a while?* Ivan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I will in a bit. I&#39;m just tired. And grumpy.* I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan leaned over and kissed me softly. I whimpered when he began to pull away. Ivan grinned and kissed me more passionately. He pressed his lips harder against my own and I felt the electricity surge through me. Ivan deepened the kiss as he explored my mouth with his tongue. My fangs pushed their way out and I could feel Ivan&#39;s desire burn underneath. The heat intensified to an almost painful degree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan?* I asked, worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I need you to feed from me, Ari. Please.* Ivan gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat continued to spread through Ivan&#39;s body and I felt the pain that came with it. I did as he asked and bit down on his lip, sucking some of his blood from his lip. A growl came from me as the taste of his blood hit my tongue. I felt my hunger intensify as I broke the kiss and went towards his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat pain that Ivan was feeling was getting more intense. I quickly sunk my teeth into his jugular and Ivan gasped. I felt the pleasure spread throughout his body, quickly extinguishing the heat. After I drained him completely I released him. I licked his neck, closing the wound. Ivan was trying to catch his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan what just happened?* I asked, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*That&#39;s how it feels if you guys don&#39;t feed on us. For some reason it happens when you get too hungry. I don&#39;t know why. But that&#39;s the only time I feel pain. As soon as you bite down it eases up.* Ivan explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I thought that only happened if we didn&#39;t feed on you for a while. Like you needing to shift into a wolf at least 1 time a month.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It usually does, but remember, I&#39;ve only recently gotten my wolf back. Things are different for me at first. I think my body is trying to make up for lost time. That&#39;s all.* Ivan explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I hope that&#39;s all it is. We can&#39;t have you doing down for the count every time I get hungry. I will get hungry a lot, especially if the battle is difficult.* I said, worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It usually doesn&#39;t affect me. You&#39;ve been a lot hungrier than that before. I think it is when you resist feeding when you need to and we are able. Remember when we fought. I could feel you in my mind and I knew you were hungry after everything happened. I didn&#39;t have the same reaction then.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yeah but you also didn&#39;t have access to your wolf. Ivan this is serious. We should probably mention it to Drake. If it keeps going this way we&#39;re going to have to figure something out. When we leave, you&#39;ll have access to your wolf. It&#39;s not going to be good if you are writhing in pain because I&#39;m hungry and haven&#39;t fed from you.* I pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I know, Ari. We&#39;ll talk to him. See what he says. We might as well reach out now. Do you still want to practice with Keo today or not?* Ivan asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Not totally. I want to play with the idea you gave me more. But I want to take a break. I still want to just lay in your arms.* I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan grinned, *Sounds good to me. We should let them know though. That way they&#39;re not expecting you to keep practicing. I&#39;m sure Keo is frustrated and wanting a break too.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nestled into Ivan&#39;s arms before reaching out to Drake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Hey, kiddo. You ok? Keo seems exhausted and a little moody.* Drake mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan laughed, *Ari is too. We should probably limit working on things. Too much practice could make things worse. Maybe instead of just going until they get frustrated we stop it at an hour? Practice one thing for an hour at a time. It would give them a bit of time to recharge.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I agree. Let&#39;s call it done for the night for them practicing switching. Are you going to run with Caleb tonight?* Drake asked Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yeah. I need to. Besides, Ari likes the run too.* Ivan told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement sparked in me as I thought about being able to feel Ivan running in his wolf form. It was amazing. To feel his paws pushing off of the ground. To feel the wind through his fur. It was an amazing feeling. One I would probably never get over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It seems pretty amazing, Ariya.* Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What? How did you know?* I asked, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You have me connected to your mind, Ariya. I know what you think as you think it. Whether you say it out loud or not.* Drake pointed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Oh yeah. Right. Is Keo going to be ok?* I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yeah, he&#39;ll be ok. I think we just stressed you both out. I like Ivan&#39;s idea of just going an hour at a time. Rotating through things and people. Too much of something could end up bad.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*There&#39;s something else we needed to talk to you about.* I told Drake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What&#39;s going on?* Drake asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan&#39;s getting the burning feeling when I&#39;m hungry.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*That&#39;s natural at first. Don&#39;t worry about it. When you first bond with the person and first turn they get the feeling a lot more. It&#39;s more of a reminder that it needs to happen often. After a little bit it goes away and then really only pops up if you don&#39;t feed for a while. Or if you are in desperate need to feed and you are able to safely. It&#39;s their body&#39;s way of preparing them to handle the amount. My understanding is the burning is from their body pushing the blood through faster.* Drake explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*How long is it going to last?* I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*A couple months probably. I know it&#39;s not pleasant but if you know you&#39;re hungry, just feed immediately. Don&#39;t wait if you can feed. Ivan will be fine even if you&#39;re hungry if he doesn&#39;t have access to his wolf. It&#39;s his wolf trying to help.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*See, nothing to worry about.* Ivan reassured me, *Thank you for explaining it to us, Drake.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Anytime. We&#39;ll see you tonight. Reach out if you need us before that.*</p>
