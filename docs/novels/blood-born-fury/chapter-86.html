                <p>*Keo and I heard the front door open and ran out to see Mom walk in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you 2 doing up at this time?&#34; Mom asked us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our eyes went wide as we saw the 2 boys next to Mom and Drake. The older boy was covered in blood and stared at the ground. I felt my eyes water up as I looked at him. I wanted so badly to run up and hug him. To hold him and let him know that he wasn&#39;t alone. I knew he wasn&#39;t ok. I could guess that he watched his parents die. He wouldn&#39;t be ok for a while. The other boy seemed to be shaking. He was scared but not of us. He seemed scared from whatever it was that he had seen or heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just wanted to help.&#34; Keo answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom sighed, &#34;I appreciate that, but you 2 are supposed to be in bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off the older boy. I knew it was rude, but I couldn&#39;t stop staring. My heart pulled toward him. I heard Drake clear his throat softly and I took a step towards the older boy. I felt Keo grab the back of my shirt and tug softly. He was trying to get my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya.&#34; Mom called me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snapped out of my trance and looked at her, &#34;Please, Mom. Can we help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom locked eyes with me for a moment before speaking, &#34;I guess since you both are already up. Help them get cleaned up, changed and then make some room for them in your room. We&#39;ll figure out a permanent situation in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo and I looked at each other and nodded. We didn&#39;t even have to talk. We already knew what the plan was and who was going to handle what. I walked up to the older boy but he didn&#39;t move. He continued staring at the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi. I&#39;m Ariya. What&#39;s your name?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t move. Didn&#39;t make a sound. I wasn&#39;t sure if he&#39;d heard me. I looked up at my Mom, concerned. Mom&#39;s expression was sad but she nodded her head at me. Letting me know it was ok to continue even if he didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just do what he lets you, Ariya. Don&#39;t force anything. He&#39;s been through a lot tonight.&#34; She told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and gently grabbed his arm and led him further into the room. He followed me without resistance and without taking his eyes off the ground. I looked over to Keo and nodded. Keo walked up to the other boy and introduced himself like I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi. My name&#39;s Keothi, but you can call me Keo. What&#39;s your name?&#34; Keo asked the other boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb.&#34; He whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it ok if we head to the bathroom so we can get you cleaned up?&#34; Keo asked, softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb nodded. He was shaking but followed Keo to the bathroom. He seemed more alert and was able to talk even though he was scared. Caleb had some blood on him and was covered in dirt. It was likely that he hadn&#39;t seen nearly as much but I was sure that he had seen his parents dead. The boy in front of me was different. He was covered in blood. His hands had shards of glass in them. His clothes were ripped in places. I could tell that he had tried to fight back. From his expression I was positive that he was in shock from watching his parents die. I pulled out a small chair and had him sit down. He was maybe 5 or 6 years older than Keo and I. We were 5 and this boy looked to be about 10 or 11.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t imagine the pain he was feeling. He never looked at me or anyone else. He only continued to stare at the ground. He never even made a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be right back. I&#39;m going to get some stuff to help clean you up, ok?&#34; I said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited for a second to see if he would answer but he didn&#39;t. I walked over to the bathroom where Keo and Caleb were. I knocked lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keo? Is it ok if I come in? I need to get a couple things.&#34; I said through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened up and I saw that Caleb was sitting on the lid of the toilet. He was still shaking. Keo looked at me, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything ok, Ari?&#34; Keo asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think so. I need a couple small towels, 2 small buckets with warm water, tweezers and some bandages.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t put the bandages on too tightly. They&#39;ll have to come off when he showers. I think Mom or Drake is going to have to help him if he doesn&#39;t move on his own. Do you think he&#39;s going to be ok?&#34; Keo asked, helping to grab the stuff I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He won&#39;t.&#34; Caleb whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo and I looked at Caleb, curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That much blood on him. He fought back. He was there when it happened. You know he watched them die.&#34; Caleb said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you&#34; Keo started but decided not to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See it? No. I heard it. I went to go see what was going on but the power got knocked out. I got shoved into the ground. Drake showed up and the attackers were killed. I saw my parents on the floor dead though.&#34; Caleb whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keo walked up and hugged Caleb, &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb sobbed in Keo&#39;s arms. I looked at them sadly. I took 2 small towels and put one in each bucket. I put the tweezers in my pocket and picked up both buckets, heading back to the older boy. When I came back he hadn&#39;t moved at all. He was still staring at the ground. I opened my mouth to say something but decided against it. I didn&#39;t want to force him to speak but I wanted him to know that I was here for him. So I decided to kneel on the ground and put my face in front of his gaze. As soon as I did it was like he snapped back to reality. He sucked in a sharp breath and his eyes glowed a beautiful sapphire blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa! Your eyes are glowing!&#34; I shouted in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom and Drake were back in the room within seconds. I had moved back from the surprise and the older boy had lifted his head, continuing to look at me. He locked eyes with me and I couldn&#39;t help but continue to stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your eyes are beautiful.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya.&#34; My Mom said, trying to get my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to look at my Mom, &#34;I&#39;m sorry! I wanted him to know that he wasn&#39;t alone but I wanted to let him know that I was going to pull the glass out of his hands so I put my head in front of his eye line and then his eyes changed and glowed this beautiful blue. I&#39;m sorry! I didn&#39;t mean&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy, Ariya. You&#39;re not in trouble. I just wanted to know what happened and make sure everything is ok. Do you need any help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not right now. Keo said we might later. I&#39;m going to get him as cleaned up as I can right now.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, call us when you need us. Drake and I have some things to take care of.&#34; Mom told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and then turned my attention back to the older boy. He was still staring at me but his eyes were fading back to their usual color which I was sure was black. I wasn&#39;t sure if they were black from his pain or if they were normally that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34; I asked him, unsure if he would tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan.&#34; He said so softly I almost didn&#39;t hear him.*</p>
