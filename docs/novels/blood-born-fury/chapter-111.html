                <p>*Ariya*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finished feeding from the blood bag that Boss gave me. My mind was racing and I could feel Ivan&#39;s racing as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*We&#39;re going to have to put a pin in all of this for now, Ivan.* I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*No kidding. I guess we just focus on what&#39;s going on right now.* Ivan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Boss, &#34;What&#39;s next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss grinned, &#34;Depends on who wants to fight you. Are you up for it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my body finish healing and focused on how I was feeling. I was trying to make sure nothing else needed to be fixed. I got to my feet and looked back at Boss again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fighting Ivan had been thrilling. I knew I would lose and I knew it was going to hurt when I lost but it was amazing. I was only able to keep up with him by using my Dragon Eye ability and even that was a task. I wasn&#39;t sure how he was so fast but I had a feeling it had something to do with being an Original Navi Wolf. Then again, he didn&#39;t have access to his wolf. I would have to ask him after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss announced to the arena that anyone that thought they might stand a chance could come down and fight me. Either one on one or as a team. As expected, Jess and Adam wanted to fight. They chose to fight together which ended up being their downfall. I didn&#39;t even activate my Dragon Eye ability to fight them. They worked well at times but Jess was so focused on trying to prove a point that when I threw Adam at her she wasn&#39;t expecting it. She almost punched Adam at one point when they both went after me at the same time. I made quick work of them. Fighting them after fighting Ivan was sad. They were so slow I felt I could take a nap in between attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss had given me permission to hit back but I knew that was the extent of it. If I broke something in the process I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d care. But if I lost control or let my vampire side come out, I was sure I would get it. So I held back. Not that I really needed to. Ivan couldn&#39;t hide his amusement from my thoughts. His face was blank, almost like he was bored on the outside but on the inside it was completely different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You know, it&#39;s pretty obvious you&#39;re toying with them, princess. You shouldn&#39;t play with your food.* Ivan pushed the thought to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Can&#39;t help it. They&#39;re boring. Fighting you was amazing. It was difficult and I had to actually work hard. This is dumb. They&#39;re slow and it&#39;s like they&#39;re not even trained.* I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved with ease and then decided I was done playing with them so I quickly punched Adam in the face, sending him flying across the ground. Jess charged me and I slipped under her attack and lunged forward punching her hard in the gut. She went flying down to the ground as well. Both of them could barely move and Boss stopped the fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mya, Leo, go fix those 2 up. Anyone else care to try?&#34; Boss asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one dared raise their hand after my fight with Jess and Adam. They all sat quietly, frozen in fear. I looked from face to face, one stunned expression to the next. No one dared challenge me. It made me wonder, if Boss wasn&#39;t here, would they try to fight me if I tried to escape? I pushed the thought away quickly. There was a lot that needed to be figured out before I could try to escape. For instance, my restraint system was basically a proximity alarm for Boss. Then there was Boss himself who apparently had more than 1 ability. Which brought up the question of how it was even possible. Then there were the Enforcers. There were 8 of them and that was the extent of our knowledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe next time, none of you will question my decisions.&#34; Boss growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone visibly stiffened in the room and the air felt tense. Like it had been doused in gasoline and the smallest spark would create an explosion that would kill everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get back to work. We&#39;re done here.&#34; Boss ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone quickly left the arena and went back to work like Boss had ordered. Boss looked at Justin and I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We forgot to heal your face, Justin.&#34; Boss said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked over at Ivan and could see that the split above his eye was starting to swell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I can do it. I can tell Boss that I can.* I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You can&#39;t use your tongue, Ari.* Ivan snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I won&#39;t!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can probably do it, Boss.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss looked at me curiously, &#34;You can heal him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, &#34;I&#39;ve seen Drake do it before when I was back home. Same with my Mom. I&#39;m sure I can figure it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss&#39;s eyes lit up, &#34;New memories?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kinda. All these little ones came back last night. Small stuff like eating food together. Going to bed. Playing. Laughing. That type of stuff. There&#39;s a few memories of my Mom and Drake healing us when we got hurt while we were playing. Nothing crazy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So not everything is back then?&#34; Boss asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet. I&#39;m guessing the ones that aren&#39;t back are important?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They should be. Guess we&#39;ll have to wait and see. Go ahead and heal Justin, if he&#39;ll let you. He hates people touching him, you know.&#34; Boss smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Justin, &#34;Is it ok if I try?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Justin glared at me, &#34;Try anything and I&#39;ll knock you out again. This time I&#39;ll wait until you&#39;re awake to fix you up so I know you feel every bit of the pain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stiffened. I knew he was playing his part but he was so good at it, it threw me off sometimes, especially now. I heard Boss laugh at my hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked right up and glared back at Justin, &#34;I haven&#39;t tried anything yet!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Justin smirked and nodded, &#34;Fine, try to heal it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my hand over the spot on his lip and closed my eyes. I focused on closing the wound like I did when I usually did it with my tongue. I felt the pieces of skin put themselves back together. Once it felt like it was closed I opened my eyes and looked. Boss was staring at me, his eyes wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can heal people.&#34; Boss exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I figured I could. We can heal ourselves and I know my Mom and Drake would heal us from time to time.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were you thinking when you did it?&#34; Boss asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought about it going back to how it was before. I thought about closing it.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it ok for me to do the other one?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss nodded and I looked at Justin who also nodded. I did the same thing that I did with his lip. When I was done I removed my hand and stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can the wolves do that?&#34; Boss asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think so. They don&#39;t heal themselves that I know of. I think only Blood Borns can. I don&#39;t think turned vampires can. Just Blood Borns.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Interesting. Bring her back to the room. I know I said we&#39;d talk and we will, but not today. We&#39;ll talk tomorrow.&#34; Boss told Justin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Boss took his leave. Justin motioned for me to head back. As we headed back our thoughts became increasingly loud. I tried to shove my own thoughts down as best I could until we were in the room where we could freely discuss the events that occurred. I could feel Ivan doing the same as we headed back. We couldn&#39;t help it though. There were so many more questions now than there had been before.</p>
