                <p>&#34;Is that how you knew which of us was which?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes. It is such a small difference that I almost can&#39;t tell. I usually just had to look at one of you and check in with how I felt. I feel a pull when I am looking at you. Or I feel calm when I&#39;m touching you. Like now, with you in my arms. I feel calm. If it&#39;s Keo, I don&#39;t feel that sensation. That&#39;s how I usually could tell. It was me being mated to you. But I think when we bond it will be even easier.&#34; Ivan explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll have to let me know. Keo and I were curious if you&#39;d be able to notice if we switched minds if we are able to.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m curious to see if I can. If you guys switch you&#39;ll have to try hard to not tell me. Though Keo might get kissed.&#34; Ivan laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would die laughing if that happened. Keo would never forgive us for that. I don&#39;t know how much I would like that either though.&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I would like it much either. I would really rather not kiss your brother the way I kiss you. That would be weird.&#34; Ivan laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe we should change how we greet each other?&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan pouted, &#34;I&#39;m listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about once you confirm you are yourself, you have to work on confirming it is me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan cocked his head to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In other words, we can have a conversation each time. Or you could just stare at me for a minute and then guess?&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You 2 are able to talk the exact same way. I don&#39;t think having a conversation is going to let me know. But if it is him, I can talk to him and see if you still can mimic each other. I should be able to just look at you and tell. But before kissing you I promise to guess.&#34; Ivan laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So now the question is, should we tell Keo?&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, please. Because if he denies being you I&#39;ll punch him if I end up kissing him.&#34; Ivan growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, &#34;Well we haven&#39;t been able to even start trying. He&#39;s still getting the hang of making a link. I think he&#39;s able to link with Drake now though. I was told that he was never able to do it until I was able to connect with him the first time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder if it&#39;s because you both had to turn before being able to.&#34; Ivan thought out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what, that&#39;s probably why he&#39;s the same age as me.&#34; I said, puzzle pieces clicking into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait what? I never even realized. He is the same age as you. That&#39;s not possible though. Didn&#39;t he turn when you both were 9?&#34; Ivan asked, suddenly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, when I asked him about it was the night we were trying to get out of here. He said it was a long story and that it was something to do with our weirdo twin thing. But I forgot to ask him with all the craziness that&#39;s happened.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder if that&#39;s why you both ended up with the same scars.&#34; Ivan whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at him, &#34;They were done by 2 totally different people and at 2 totally different times. I think that&#39;s just a coincidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know they were but they&#39;re literally the exact same. I wonder if what happens to one twin, happens eventually to the other?&#34; Ivan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about it for a while. But it didn&#39;t seem like that would be true. For one thing, Ivan was only bonded to me. There wasn&#39;t a female original Navi wolf that we knew about. I also had watched our Mom burn alive and that definitely didn&#39;t happen to Keo. We had lived different lives for the longest time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve lived completely different lives for the last 14 years. Our experiences are completely different. How would it work if one twin has something happen, that it would happen to the other twin?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s to do with emotions or experiences, Ari. I think it&#39;s more with a physical appearance.&#34; Ivan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan, I don&#39;t know if you know this, but we are already physically different. Keo is a male and I&#39;m a female. That automatically makes a lot of things different for us.&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan laughed with me, &#34;That&#39;s true. I didn&#39;t mean it that way though. If you both are able to switch, what if you can only switch if the physical damage you have taken was the same. Or the age part. What if you guys only stop aging when you both turn? Or maybe you&#39;ll continue to age until you reach your prime. Maybe that part is a blood born thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t think us being twins is going to affect a lot though.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think it will affect too much. But I do think it will affect some stuff.&#34; Ivan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I should reach out to Keo. Make sure he knows about the identity verification and then ask about the weirdo twin thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think it&#39;s a good idea, but I&#39;m not letting you go while you do.&#34; Ivan told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snuggled into his chest, &#34;Wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Keo?* I reached out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Hey, Ari.* Keo responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You never told me about the weirdo twin thing. How come you aged?* I asked him, getting right to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Oops. Sorry. It is something to do with us being twins. Drake isn&#39;t totally sure either. It&#39;s kinda new for everyone. We were the first set of twins. Drake didn&#39;t even know we could turn by dying. We only found out because of me.* Keo explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*About that, how did you turn? You didn&#39;t activate your abilities beforehand.* I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I did though. I was searching for you that night. When I found you, I was in shock at first. I rounded the corner and saw him standing over you ready to kill you. As soon as he started to bring the blade down it was like something clicked together. Everything was in slow motion for me. I saw what was going to happen and was running to you. I wasn&#39;t totally fast enough but somehow I was able to pull you down and get in front of you. I know I used the dragon&#39;s eye when the blade was coming down. But I also somehow used my energy manipulation at the same time. I heard it was pretty similar for you as well, but you had 2 people you were protecting?* Keo asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yeah. I activated them in almost the same way. But how is it that it happened the same way for us?* I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Drake just chalked it up to us being twins. We&#39;re not really sure. Like I said, there&#39;s never been a set of twins before us. Maybe we had to turn the same way. The universe does some crazy stuff sometimes.* Keo laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*True. Speaking of crazy stuff. If we are able to switch places, Ivan might ask if it&#39;s you or me. You need to tell him honestly if it is you.* I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*But that ruins the fun, Ari. If he just asks how are we going to know if we fooled him? I can&#39;t just tell him.* Keo laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Fine. Get kissed then.* I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Wait. What?* I could tell Keo about fell over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan can tell by looking at us. He&#39;s going to show it&#39;s him and then he&#39;s going to do his wolfy thing and then guess which of us it is. If we figure it out and he guesses it to be you, you need to tell him. Or he might end up kissing you.* I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*He told you then?* Keo asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Wait, you knew?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Not completely. I knew he loved you. Caleb told us he was pretty sure that Ivan was mated to you. I didn&#39;t know that gave Ivan special abilities to tell us apart though. That explains so many things now though.* Keo laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*That&#39;s what I said! But yes, that is why. There&#39;s more to it though. We just don&#39;t remember everything. We are going to bond though, Keo.* I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m happy for you, Ari. Are you sure this is what you want?* Keo asked me, seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I don&#39;t have a doubt about it. We decided we would wait to bond until we have all the information.* I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*We all support you. Make sure to talk to Drake beforehand. I think he knows everything but he&#39;s not supposed to say, you know?* Keo said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Will do. Are you going to bond with Caleb?* I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Not in the same way you bond with Ivan.* Keo laughed, *But yes, if Caleb is ok with it. We won&#39;t until after you bond with Ivan. Oh and Ari, keep in mind, if we bond with them, they won&#39;t age anymore. Not as long as we&#39;re alive.*</p>
