                <p>*Ivan*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel the panic rise in me but I had to stop and rationalize it. I should be Justin right now. But I&#39;m not. I&#39;m me. But my memories are surrounded by darkness. What does that mean? Am I Justin? I can&#39;t be, because I wouldn&#39;t remember being Ivan. Being me. What is going on? Can Ari feel anything? Should we try to run instead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed Ariya&#39;s arm and she turned and looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did I do something wrong?&#34; She asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t seem shocked or worried. My eyebrows pushed together as I was trying to figure things out. Everything must appear to be as it always is on the outside. So what the hell was going on, on the inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I just thoughtnevermind. Keep going.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed at me like she didn&#39;t understand what was going on. I hoped she would be able to put it together. Maybe I could talk to her? I wasn&#39;t sure how. I couldn&#39;t just outright ask her. We could be being watched. I tried to break it down for myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My name is Ivan. II don&#39;t know anything past that. I don&#39;t have my memories. I know I love Ariya. I know it&#39;s on a deeper level than everyone else&#39;s typical connections. What am I missing? What is going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t any time to figure things out. It was too late. We came up to the arena without passing anyone that we could visibly see. I was sure there were people that were watching on the way there. We were at the bottom of the arena and it looked like Boss had built it to be similar to a gladiator arena. Boss met us in the center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Glad to see you behaved on the way here, Ariya.&#34; Boss grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know why you would think I wouldn&#39;t.&#34; Ariya told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think you wouldn&#39;t. It was more to show them. Behaving only lets you keep what you have. If you had misbehaved you would have lost some stuff. But now you&#39;re going to help me out.&#34; Boss told her at a volume that no one but the 3 of us could hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;s that?&#34; Ariya asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because by helping me out, you&#39;re not going to be tortured. Not in that room how I had first described to you, anyway. You&#39;ll come here. I&#39;ll learn about your abilities as you develop them. Hold back and I&#39;ll switch to torture. Got it?&#34; Boss threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How am I supposed to help you?&#34; Ariya asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By beating any volunteers.&#34; Boss told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand.&#34; Ariya told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will soon.&#34; Boss said then looked at everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that everyone is here, let&#39;s begin. Many of you have your concerns. I don&#39;t usually bother explaining myself but I get it. Many of you believe silly things like Ariya isn&#39;t a Navi. Or that she&#39;s not as strong as some of you. Some of you are wondering why no one is allowed in the room except for Justin and I. I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s time to show you. Afterwards, if you still think you have what it takes, you can volunteer. There&#39;s a reason why it&#39;s only Justin. And he&#39;ll prove it to you by fighting Ariya when she&#39;s at her full strength.&#34; Boss announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were mumbles across the room but everyone was watching intently. Boss took 2 blood bags and handed them to Ariya. She hesitated before taking them from him. I watched her closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll sweeten the deal Ariya, if you manage to beat Justin and everyone here, I&#39;ll let you go free. Hold back at all or disobey me and I&#39;ll switch to torture. Got it?&#34; Boss told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I can&#39;t hold back, Ari. He&#39;ll know if I do and we know we can&#39;t beat him.* I tried pushing to Ariya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure if she would get my message but she whirled around looking at me wide-eyed. I tensed up slightly but smirked at her, menacingly. My face dared her to challenge me. Boss smirked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Fix your face, princess. We can&#39;t let them know that I&#39;m talking to you.* I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan? How?* She asked, turning back to Boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Remember how I felt different. This is apparently it.* I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I can&#39;t beat you or Justin.&#34; She whispered to Boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold back and you get tortured.&#34; Boss said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Anger, Ariya. Your eyes are different now. Remember, anger is the key to getting them to the old color.* I reminded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt Ariya&#39;s anger rise as she focused on her hate for Boss. For putting us in this situation. I felt her feelings come through as she channeled what I felt. The anger I had about having to hurt her. Her eyes changed color to the red of a Navi and her lip curled back above her canines as they formed into fangs. She bit into the first blood bag that Boss gave her. Gasps came from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan, we&#39;re about to fight and you know you are you. What does that mean?* She asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t have all my memories. It&#39;s why I grabbed you in the hall. I was worried that my hair had changed back.* I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It didn&#39;t. On the outside, you look like Justin. Do you have all your memories? What about your wolf? How is this possible?* Ariya said, starting to worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s possible, but it is. I don&#39;t have access to my wolf. I can feel it now that you&#39;ve mentioned it. I can feel my wolf but it&#39;s behind a barrier. I can&#39;t access it. My memories are surrounded by darkness somehow but you mentioning my wolf reminds me that it&#39;s there. I just can&#39;t access it like I said. Ari, this means that Justin is gone.* I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya finished the first blood bag and went to the second one. Boss came closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let me down, Justin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t. I&#39;ll win.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good, because I decided to give you both weapons.&#34; Boss smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Don&#39;t hold back, Ivan.* Ariya told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I won&#39;t. We already agreed. But now we can really treat this like a sparring match.* I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel Ariya&#39;s excitement rise. Boss came back with Escrima sticks. A set for each of us. I felt my excitement rise this time. A quick memory flashed through my head of my Dad teaching me how to fight with them when I was little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Oh this is gonna be fun!* Ariya squealed in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked, &#34;You&#39;re making this easier on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I?&#34; Boss asked, grinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya finished the 2 blood bags and traded them for the Escrima sticks from Boss. She turned to face me. She had a serious expression on her face. I could see her determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You have to go all out, Ivan. Play your part.* She told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*So do you, Ari. Make sure you play your part.* I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The arena went silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The only rule here, Ariya, is that you can&#39;t kill anyone. The fight ends when I say or when someone is knocked out.&#34; Boss warned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything else is ok?&#34; Ariya asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No biting anyone. But the rest is fine.&#34; Boss added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya smirked, &#34;Fair enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The arena was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. Ariya and I faced each other. Neither of us took a fighting stance. Both of us gave off the impression that this would be an easy fight. We were playing our parts well. I could feel everyone watching. All eyes were on us and everyone was at the edge of their seats. Boss moved away so we wouldn&#39;t run into him while we fought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ready, princess?* I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ready.* She told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;BEGIN!&#34; Boss bellowed, starting the fight.</p>
