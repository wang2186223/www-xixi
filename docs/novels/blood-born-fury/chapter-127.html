                <p>Drake infiltrated my mind. I screamed out trying not to let him but he had hold of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Ivan. But if you&#39;re going to be the one that infiltrates, you can&#39;t remember anything that would give you away. Which means you can&#39;t remember Ariya.&#34; Drake told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled as Drake started locking my memories away. He was taking her from me. I&#39;d practically lost her a couple times already tonight but now he was taking her away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please! Stop! Don&#39;t do this! Don&#39;t take her away from me!&#34; I begged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Ivan. Find out if anyone is there. If they have any Navi. Then see if they have a plan, or if they think that we&#39;re completely wiped out. Figure out their plan and then you&#39;ll be able to remember Ariya. After that go get Ariya and Caleb.&#34; Drake told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sealed the last of my memories, pulling his hand away from my head. I fell to the ground. I didn&#39;t know what was going on anymore. Who was I? What happened? Someone was nearby but they left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m still here. I&#39;m still alive. Is anyone there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled myself off the ground, stumbled and fell. The smell of things burning hit my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have to get out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hauled myself off the ground and headed away from the burning smell. I was limping, injured from fighting most likely. As I came around the corner I saw someone up ahead being attacked. I ran towards them as fast as my injured body would carry me. I saw a short knife on the ground and grabbed it, launching it at the person that was attacking the other one. The knife buried itself into the attacker&#39;s shoulder. The attacker hollered in pain and turned toward me. I felt an anger burn inside of me as I faced the attacker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My adrenaline spiked and it was like I no longer felt the pain I had. I ran towards the attacker picking up a sword from the ground on my way there. The attacker had done the same and our blades collided. Sparks flew and the sound of metal clanging flew through the air. The attacker nicked my forehead slightly and the blood flowed down my face. The attacker growled, baring his fangs at me. I took the small window and hit his sword so it flew out his hand skittering across the ground. Continuing the motion of the movement I spun and plunged the sword deep into his chest. The attacker caught the blade, blood spewing from his mouth. He coughed and growled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person I&#39;d protected was behind me and gasped in shock as the battle came to a close. I felt the anger leak off of me toward the attacker. I didn&#39;t know who they even were but I hated them for some reason. I stared at this person in the eyes, my hate for them evident. The attacker however, was not about to go down so easily. He growled ferociously at me and grabbed my head with his other hand. Waves of pain went through me as I cried out. My grip on the sword loosened and the attacker disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fell to the ground on the edge of losing consciousness. The world was fading out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to get out of here! Come on!&#34; The man I&#39;d protected shouted, grabbing my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hauled me to my feet as I tried desperately to hold on to my consciousness. Luckily my adrenaline was still surging through me. Our trek was miles long and I was barely able to keep upright. When we arrived at our destination I collapsed on the ground. The darkness, taking hold of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have still been somewhat awake because I was aware of what was going on around me but I couldn&#39;t move. My body had reached its limit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell happened?&#34; A voice said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He fought Drake and I&#39;d say they tied.&#34; The man I&#39;d protected answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is he though?&#34; The voice asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One of the rookies I&#39;m guessing. We brought all of them with us, including their trainers. They&#39;re all dead. I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re the only 2 left alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you have us go with you? Or bring the Enforcers? Not everyone had to die.&#34; The voice growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I needed you elsewhere. Remember who you&#39;re talking to, Ryker.&#34; The man I&#39;d protected growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mean any disrespect, Boss. But everyone is dead. Only you and this rookie are left. Was the cost worth it?&#34; Ryker asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d say so. Just about every single Navi is dead. Based on the wound that this guy gave Drake, I&#39;m sure Drake&#39;s knocking on death&#39;s door. With no one to help him. That just leaves a child. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a girl or boy. They both looked identical and I killed one of them. There should only be 2 left if Drake manages to live. We&#39;ll hunt them down and kill them soon enough.&#34; Boss told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want done with the rookie?&#34; Ryker asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That depends. Drake got hold of him at the end. I doubt if he remembers anything at all. He might not even remember how to fight.&#34; Boss scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think Drake would have sealed his entire past? Why bother saving him then?&#34; Ryker asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s possible he did. If Drake did seal his past, we&#39;ll never be able to break through the barriers. He&#39;ll basically be a shell. I only saved him because he saved my life. If he even remembers a bit of how to fight, he&#39;ll be worth the trouble. I&#39;ve never seen anyone that is capable of fighting Drake using just a sword. But he did. Even though he&#39;s a rookie, it&#39;s worth teaching him.&#34; Boss answered him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Interesting. Let me take him. I&#39;ll train him and see if we can get anything from his mind.&#34; Ryker offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a bit below you but whatever. Do as you wish, Ryker. It&#39;s not like we have anyone capable of training him anymore. We&#39;ll have to do a lot of restructuring anyway. I&#39;ll have a lot of work to do. Make sure you report his progress daily.&#34; Boss told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh and Ryker, try not to kill the poor kid. Remember, he did manage to fight off Drake and make it out alive.&#34; Boss cooed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No promises. Breaking people is my specialty after all.&#34; Ryker laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard footsteps leave the room. I knew someone was still here but I was still laying there. Eyes closed. Unable to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lucky, kid. Boss doesn&#39;t usually stick his neck out for people. You impressed him. Hopefully you remember enough to stay alive.&#34; Ryker said before leaving the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, we were called over here?&#34; A soft voice said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only one that managed to live. Though it doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s doing so well. Do what you can to heal him. When he wakes, find me. If he dies, let me know.&#34; Ryker instructed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir.&#34; The soft voice said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the person get closer to me. I felt their hands hover over my body and a gasp of shock as they assessed the damage. They got to work healing me and the darkness finally took hold of my consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I awoke with a start, unsure of where I was or what was going on. My body ached all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy now, kid. Do you know where you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the person who spoke to me, the voice was familiar. I had heard it when I first got here. As my mind began putting the pieces together it hit me. This voice belonged to Ryker. He looked to be in his early thirties. Kind of taller, maybe around 6 feet. But he was stocky which made him appear a bit shorter. His hair was black and buzzed on the sides but spiky on the top.  I looked around, I didn&#39;t recognize where I was. I shook my head no at Ryker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryker raised an eyebrow at me, &#34;Can you speak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat burned from the effort and I coughed. Ryker handed me some water which I drank down quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know your name?&#34; Ryker asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought hard. Who am I? My eyes widened as I couldn&#39;t remember something as simple as my name. My breathing picked up as the panic started to set in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy, kid. You&#39;ve been through a lot. We figured you wouldn&#39;t remember much of anything. Do you remember the last thing that happened before you got here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried thinking back but nothing was coming to me except small pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember a burning smell. I know I fought someone. I know I saved someone. I don&#39;t remember anything else.&#34; I answered, shakily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More than I thought you would. Drake must not have had time to do too much damage to you. Unfortunately for you, you&#39;re stuck with me now. I&#39;ll be your trainer moving forward. If you make it through training, you&#39;ll likely be extremely hard to kill here. Otherwise, you&#39;ll be dead.&#34; Ryker smirked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wouldn&#39;t matter if I was dead or not. It&#39;s not like I remember anything anyway.&#34; I scoffed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then let&#39;s just cut to the chase, shall we?&#34; Ryker said and then quickly grabbed my head with both of his hands.</p>
