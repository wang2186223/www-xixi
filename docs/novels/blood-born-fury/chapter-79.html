                <p>&#34;Can we wait just a bit longer before we tell Boss about your hair?&#34; I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but we can&#39;t wait too long. He&#39;ll get suspicious and he might start to figure out that you can talk to the others if we wait too long. If that happens, there&#39;s no telling what he&#39;ll do.&#34; Ivan said, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want us to be able to bond first. That&#39;s it. I want to make sure that we can communicate without struggling or waiting for everyone to be gone. I want to know that we can let the other know immediately of any danger. I want to make sure that I am not going to lose you before we get a chance to bond.&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan looked at me lovingly, &#34;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get the memories back soon, princess. But so you know, I feel the same.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Ivan, questioningly and he blushed but didn&#39;t say anything. We both knew. We just wanted to have our memories back before saying it. We&#39;d already said it for the most part but not directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed in Ivan&#39;s arms for a little longer before he sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we wait too long, Boss might get suspicious about why I didn&#39;t immediately go get food and everything. Besides, I want to go get the blanket for you.&#34; Ivan grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him suspiciously, &#34;What are you planning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything, princess.&#34; Ivan laughed, &#34;But on a serious note, I do need to get things done or he&#39;s going to notice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pouted, &#34;I know. It&#39;s been nice being free of chains though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, you&#39;re not going back into chains. It&#39;s just basically like 2 bracelets. I don&#39;t love it but it&#39;s better than it was. It will still give you a lot more freedom than before.&#34; Ivan said, trying to look at a brighter side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned at him, &#34;At least it means I can curl up in your arms without having to fight the chains.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan smiled, &#34;That&#39;s one plus side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan leaned down and kissed me. He started out kissing me softly but my need for him to be closer intensified. I wanted him closer even though it wasn&#39;t possible. I wrapped my arms around his neck and pressed myself against him. My body molded to his. Our kiss became feverish and Ivan returned my need for him back. He wrapped his arms around my waist pulling me to him. His lips parted mine and his tongue began exploring my mouth. I let out a soft moan as he pressed his body against mine. I could feel his excitement against me and all I wanted was more. Ivan&#39;s self control seemed to be dissipating right in front of me. I ran my hands through Ivan&#39;s hair. Ivan&#39;s tongue brushed against my canines and a growl escaped from my throat. My canines formed into fangs and the hunger hit me. I pulled away, breaking the kiss trying to catch my breath and regain control. Ivan was breathing heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, princess. I couldn&#39;t help it.&#34; Ivan grinned at me, his eyes glowing a darker blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t make you weak and I don&#39;t want to risk hurting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t hurt me. But we should play it safe and we should bond first before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really wish we knew what the bond entailed and how to do it already.&#34; I grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan laughed, taking my face in his hands he kissed me passionately. &#34;Soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan laughed again, &#34;Don&#39;t get me wrong, princess. I agree with you if you can&#39;t tell. It&#39;s not soon enough. I&#39;m trying to be good, Ari. But I want you. I want to show you just how much I want you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s eyes were a dark blue which turned me on even more. I could feel his excitement still and knew exactly what he was saying. I wanted to show him but everytime he used his tongue and touched my canines I wasn&#39;t able to control my fangs from coming out. I was worried he would think I only wanted to feed from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t, Ari. I know it&#39;s hard to control. I also love it when you do feed from me. You don&#39;t ever have to worry about me thinking that&#39;s all you want. I promise.&#34; Ivan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him shocked, &#34;How did you know that&#39;s what I was thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan laughed, &#34;I don&#39;t know honestly. I just do. You get a look on your face like you&#39;re struggling. For some reason I can always put the pieces together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I buried my head into Ivan&#39;s chest, breathing in his scent. I knew he would have to leave as soon as it was safe for him to do so but I didn&#39;t want him to leave just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t be gone for too long. I do have to leave for a bit but I won&#39;t be gone forever. I&#39;ll be back before you know it. Can you see if Drake can meet soon? It might be better to meet up with him quickly. They&#39;re less likely to trail behind in the middle of the day if they did. It&#39;s still possible, but it might be easier to spot. Besides, I have to go get sleeping stuff for you anyway, I&#39;ll be all over the place for a minute.&#34; Ivan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and reached out to Drake. As soon as I made the connection I gave him a run down about Ivan having a memory, the update about Boss, and then spoke to him about meeting up with Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I think he&#39;s right, it would be a good time to meet up with him. I still think the night is best, but given the circumstances, now would be better.* Drake told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Where do you want to meet?* I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Have him meet me at the forest area where he shifted the first time. We should be safe there and out of range for anyone to spot us.* Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Will do. He&#39;ll be there within half an hour.* I told Drake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake did what he always did and severed the connection and locked the memories. I let Ivan know the plan right after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well then I need to get moving. I promise I&#39;ll be back as soon as I can. I&#39;ll talk to Drake, see if we can get any insight on the memories and then I&#39;ll get the sleeping stuff and food. Then I&#39;ll be back.&#34; Ivan told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be careful please.&#34; I said, looking at him worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Always.&#34; Ivan said, winking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan leaned down and kissed me once more before leaving the room to go meet with Drake.</p>
