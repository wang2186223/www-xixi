                <p>I felt goosebumps on my neck as a low growl came from behind us. A searing pain shot up in the back of my head. I saw black as I hit the ground. Mya screamed in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hang on!&#34; Link shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Link used his ability to move anything to pull us closer to him and away from danger. I sat up slowly as the pain started leaving my head. Mya. She was healing me. The sight quickly returned to me. As my eyes refocused I looked to see who was attacking us. A pair of red eyes were glaring at us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s him.&#34; Link hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No , it&#39;s not. Look closely, what do you see? He was turned. Drake would be a lot more in control or he wouldn&#39;t have stayed hidden for so long. This guy. He isn&#39;t in control. He&#39;s a rabid. As soon as Mya was close enough for him to smell her blood, he went crazy.&#34; I stated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why is he staring at all of us?&#34; Mya asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look around. We&#39;re all bleeding. But if we can&#39;t take this one out, we&#39;re definitely no match for Drake.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both gulped, suddenly unsure of themselves. While I knew whose side I was truly on, the rabid wouldn&#39;t have been allowed even in my clan. He had to be stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what we trained for. Have each other&#39;s back and we&#39;ll be fine.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right.&#34; Link said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Mya said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then, let&#39;s go!&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mya hung back like we trained, while Link and I charged forward. I drew my sword and lunged for the attack. The vampire easily side stepped my attack, flexed his body and struck me in the chest. I flew backwards. All the air flew out of me as I landed. This guy was so strong. Link took the opportunity to attack with his sword but just as easily as I was sidestepped, so was he but instead of getting knocked the way I did, he went the opposite way. I got up, drew a knife and went after the vampire. Instead of attacking me this time, he jumped over me. By the time I turned to see where the vampire went, Mya screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I shouted, running to stop him. He had grabbed one of the blades we dropped and was raising it above his head ready to slash down at Mya. I ran as fast as I could, predicting the move he was going to make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please let me make it in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vampire&#39;s arm flexed as he arcked the blade downward. As the vampire was halfway through his arc, I crossed my left and right arm over each other and raised them defensively. The vampire slashed through his arc, bringing the blade down on my arm guard as I stood over Mya, protecting her. The weight of his attack was heavy. The tip of the blade bit into my skin, slicing me over my left eye. I screamed in pain and shoved my hands up as hard as I could, the blade lifted but caught me on the way up. I kept my left eye closed as blood poured down my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation Link threw a sword at the vampire using his ability. I started running to get to Link as fast as I could. The sword hit the fence we climbed over and buried itself deep into the wood. The vampire was already at Link prepared to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;m not going to make it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Link!&#34; I shouted, reaching my arm out as if I could stop what was about to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing there was no way out. Link looked at the vampire, ready for death. As the vampire raised the sword ready to end Link&#39;s life, I shouted, &#34;STOP IT!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank as I predicted what was to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only I was stronger. If only I hadn&#39;t brought them with me. I could have come with Caleb and they wouldn&#39;t be about to lose their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blood boiled again. The rage I felt about losing them both and not being able to do anything about it. I could feel everything bubble inside of me. I desperately wanted to save them from dying. My left arm was outstretched as if I could do anything to stop it. I willed everything I had in me to save them and that was when it clicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vampire was finishing the stroke of the sword as a black dome covered over Link. That was it! I did it! My ability is almost activated completely. I was so excited that I temporarily forgot the chaos of the battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vampire glared at me with hate in his eyes. Angry, I had stopped the attack. Angry that I didn&#39;t let him get his kill. He charged at me with everything he had. His speed tripled what it had been before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Link and Mya looked at me with fear in their eyes. Unable to stop the vampire as he struck, sending me flying. An abrupt pain shot through my chest. I coughed as blood rushed up and came out of my mouth. I looked down at the metal rod sticking out of my chest. As the world around me faded to black I heard Link and Mya scream as they saw what happened.</p>
