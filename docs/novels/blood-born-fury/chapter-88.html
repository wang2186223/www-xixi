                <p>Light flashed before me and I was in a room like I had been back when my Mom died. I looked around, confused on how I&#39;d gotten here and what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my beautiful boy, I&#39;m so proud of you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked toward the voice, knowing who I was about to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom!&#34; I exclaimed, running to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held her arms out as I ran into her arms squeezing her tightly. I could feel the tears in my eyes as they burned. I didn&#39;t care. I was so happy to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled away from my Mom for a moment and turned to see him, &#34;Dad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a big hug as well. I reached out to have them both in my arms as I cried. They hugged me tightly and I could hear the sobs coming from them as well. After a few moments I looked up at them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is this possible? I&#39;m not in a memory, I&#39;m in my regular body. Where are we? Am I dreaming? Is this real?&#34; I stammered out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My parents smiled at me and I believed I was in a dream. I was happy I would have a dream instead of the memories I&#39;ve been having. It might make the next day easier. That was when I thought of Ari. I can&#39;t stay too long. I have to get back to her. But I finally got to see my parents again. My heart started to break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t do that. Don&#39;t think you have to choose between Ariya or us. You don&#39;t.&#34; My Dad told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked in surprise, &#34;How did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We know, Ivan. Now, we need to hurry because you are right about one thing, we don&#39;t have much time and you do need to get back to her.&#34; My Mom said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My Dad nodded and continued where she left off, &#34;This is a place that you will eventually get used to. It&#39;s a little weird because we&#39;re not typically the ones that can access it. But you get a special privilege because of Ariya&#39;s Mom, Mina. She was bonded to your Mom and was able to give us this opportunity when the time was right. Think of it as we&#39;re inside your head. This is about how it was for Ariya when she and Keothi switched places. This is where they all were, just in her mind, not yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded in understanding, &#34;So is this real then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kind of. We are what&#39;s left before we died that night. Mina was able to take a part of my soul and a part of your Dad&#39;s soul and lock it in your mind. We&#39;ve been watching this entire time. We are what remains of the Original Navi Wolves&#39; history. We know everything there is to know about it. But we can&#39;t stay forever, Ivan.&#34; My Mom told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So after tonight, you&#39;ll be gone?&#34; I asked sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Our time is limited but there is quite a bit of time that we do have. So don&#39;t worry about how long we have. There are plenty of conversations that we will be able to have, but they will only happen at set moments. You won&#39;t be able to see us whenever you want, unfortunately.&#34; My Dad said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re here right now for a reason?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. We are here to make sure that you don&#39;t end up back in the sadness that you got from when we first died. You are reliving everything and that includes the emotions you felt. We are here to make sure that you keep moving forward. Time has already healed this wound to be bearable.&#34; Mom explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya is going through the same thing. Why is it just us? Caleb seems fine. So do Drake and Keo.&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad laughed, &#34;That&#39;s because Caleb didn&#39;t relive it slowly. He had it all at once. Drake can&#39;t do that for you and Ariya. It would take too long and he doesn&#39;t have access to you both for that amount of time. Keo and Drake didn&#39;t lose as many memories as you did. They didn&#39;t lose painful memories, only facts about our history and everyone&#39;s true abilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom nodded, &#34;Ariya has had a very painful past and you were with her through most of it. You 2 relate on a level that no one else does. But through that pain you both can unlock your abilities on a different level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just like the 8 Enforcers that Boss has. They&#39;ve unlocked their abilities past most people&#39;s understanding. You and Ariya will be able to do the same, son.&#34; Dad told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do we do that?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust her instincts. But you must also trust your own instincts. When you 2 complete the mate bond you will be able to connect on another level.&#34; Dad said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will. But how do we complete the mate bond? We haven&#39;t gotten that memory back yet.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom and Dad gave each other a knowing look. I cocked my head to the side, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have that memory because it doesn&#39;t exist.&#34; Mom said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?! Then how&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy, why do you think we&#39;re here?&#34; Dad smirked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You both know everythingabout our history as Original Navi Wolves.&#34; I breathed in wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not only the Original Navi Wolves, but also the Blood Born Navi.&#34; Mom grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared in amazement. My parents couldn&#39;t have known that all of this was going to happen before they died. But somehow, they had planned for it. They made sure that I wouldn&#39;t be completely on my own. I began to wonder if they knew that Ariya was my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had a feeling she was when I met her for the first time. But I couldn&#39;t be certain until you met her. I felt an attachment to her and her brother, Keo, when I met them. They were always laughing and playing. We had planned to introduce you to them after you shifted for the first time. You were always meant to be a protector for them.&#34; Mom told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad laughed at my stunned expression, &#34;We know what you&#39;re thinking, even if you don&#39;t say it. We only exist inside of you now. As for the mate bond, we should have this conversation with both of you but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya could do it.&#34; I said confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure she could, my beautiful boy but it wouldn&#39;t be safe to do it. We would have to be in your mind and the only way to do that is if you are both together and unconscious.&#34; Mom said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sucked in a breath as the panic started to rise. I couldn&#39;t risk anything happening to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can tell her. Word for word of what you tell me. I will tell her.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We know you will. Before you go to her in the morning, you have to see Drake first. This conversation won&#39;t be protected by the lock that Drake put for when you&#39;re around your Boss. Which means even as Justin, you&#39;ll know that you are Ivan and a wolf.&#34; Dad said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes went wide, &#34;Which means my hair won&#39;t change back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. And to avoid running into Boss as yourself, you need to find Drake while you&#39;re in wolf form. Do you remember how? I believe you got your memory back of when Mina had you try it for the first time.&#34; Mom said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh and Ivan. Your hair looks so much better like this.&#34; Dad laughed ruffling my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I beamed up at him, &#34;I think so too. Ariya seems to love it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She loves you, my beautiful boy. She loves all of you.&#34; Mom said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s worried about feeding from me though.&#34; I said sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They get that way. Once you 2 bond she won&#39;t be so worried about it. But remember what I said about instincts. It&#39;s good you didn&#39;t push her to. You need to trust each other&#39;s instincts.&#34; Dad laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time is running out, we need to explain the mate bond to you before you wake. We won&#39;t see you again until after you both have bonded. You don&#39;t need to rush it either, Ivan. Don&#39;t forget what your Dad said, you need to see Drake before you go to work, but you must find him while you&#39;re a wolf. Don&#39;t risk being caught as your true self, Ivan.&#34; Mom warned.</p>
