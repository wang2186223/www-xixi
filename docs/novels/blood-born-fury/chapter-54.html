                <p>I breathed a sigh of relief. Ivan might not be completely out of the woods but if he could accept that he was Justin and a part of him was that way then maybe his personality wouldn&#39;t split. He would still be different when he had his memories vs when he didn&#39;t. But it wouldn&#39;t be forever that he would lose his memories. We had a while to go but it wasn&#39;t going to be forever. We could make it through it. I had to keep faith that we would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! I found out about the saran wrap!&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you now?&#34; Ivan laughed with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, so Caleb is worried about your hair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My hair?&#34; Ivan raised an eyebrow at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I don&#39;t remember for sure, but I think you were the one that was holding Keo before I passed out. If that&#39;s true then your hair was different. I don&#39;t fully remember it yet but I think your hair was like your wolf&#39;s. Black with white tips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s eyebrows pushed together, &#34;I think you&#39;re right but I don&#39;t really remember yet either. I haven&#39;t had a memory where I saw my own reflection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, &#34;That&#39;s fair. You&#39;ve always been in wolf form when I&#39;ve seen you in my memories. Except for the one time with Keo but I didn&#39;t get a clear look at you. I passed out shortly after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember, I was trying to get you to wake up right after. I shifted so I could check to see if Keo was still alive. I was going to check Derek too but you came around the corner and passed out. It scared the hell out of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well if your hair does have white tips that is different from what your hair looks like now. If you shift and your hair changes it could cause problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That still doesn&#39;t explain saran wrap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, &#34;Caleb was worried you wouldn&#39;t have your memory still and they would have to stalk you. If your hair changed color his idea was to kidnap you and saran wrap you to a chair so they could dye your hair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan laughed so hard that tears fell down his face, &#34;Is that even possible? Can you really saran wrap someone to a chair? I mean if my hair changed wouldn&#39;t that mean I would be able to shift? How did they expect me to stay in the chair for them to saran wrap me enough to hold me down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed with Ivan, &#34;No idea. We should try it one day if we have time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe we can saran wrap Boss to a chair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keo asked why not use duct tape and apparently it was because Caleb was worried about causing problems by getting dye on your skin and clothes. Caleb&#39;s not wrong though. What if your hair changes? If it does, that could cause a lot of problems if we don&#39;t have a plan for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not wrong on that. I&#39;m not sure what we could do. We could always try the dye but if it doesn&#39;t come out right then we&#39;re in the same problem. At least Caleb won&#39;t have to get too much saran wrap now. But he&#39;s right on using it to prevent the dye from getting on my skin and clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I talked to them earlier. There&#39;s a lot of obstacles that we have that are going to come up. Ones that Caleb and I didn&#39;t plan for because we didn&#39;t know what we were missing. We need to figure out what to do and fast. These problems could become very real very soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, Ari. Don&#39;t stress about it. We will figure it out.&#34; Ivan reassured me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should we do about your hair?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could try dye. I don&#39;t know if we can make it to where they get a bit of my hair. If they do, they can see about trying the dye and see if it matches color wise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The other thing Drake mentioned is that when your wolf was repressed that was when your hair changed color. You didn&#39;t remember being a wolf. What if he does it again. You can remember everything else but your wolf side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Absolutely not. If I don&#39;t remember I&#39;m a wolf then I&#39;m not going to be able to feed you if you need it. I also won&#39;t be able to prove that it&#39;s me when we&#39;re just talking. That&#39;s going to cause more problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Boss gives me some blood to make sure I don&#39;t go crazy. We could find a different way to have you prove it&#39;s you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan shifted uncomfortably, &#34;I don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s too risky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True, but so was Plan B. That&#39;s what&#39;s going on now. We transitioned to Plan B and that&#39;s why I&#39;m caught right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan growled, &#34;That should have never been an option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was the only way to find out information and get you back. Besides, I&#39;ve learned a lot so far. It also buys us time for me to get in control of myself and get my memories back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ari, you&#39;ve lost control maybe one time so far. When you were trying to get away. Outside of that, you&#39;ve been in control the entire time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not true. I lost control right after I turned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, Ari? You just turned. You&#39;re not supposed to have control at that point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then when you were Justin and you fixed my broken bones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were in pain, even if you were out there that type of thing would have happened. But you didn&#39;t fully lose control. You regained control pretty quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of you. Because I scared you.&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan growled, &#34;You scared me as Justin. But I&#39;m not scared of you, Ari.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It happened again when you mentioned me being hungry and again when we kissed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was my fault for the first one. You haven&#39;t in a bit though and it&#39;s time to. But when we kissed&#34; Ivan blushed, &#34;That ummthat&#39;s going to happen from time to time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan got even redder, &#34;It&#39;s a good thing, Ari. It just means you like mea lot&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to explain it to me one day, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before we bond, I promise to explain it to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better. Going back to your hair though, Drake said your hair might not change because when you are around others you won&#39;t remember being a wolf. But when you&#39;re around only me or them then you will remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s eyes lit up, &#34;Drake might be onto something. I have an idea of how we can test it. But they&#39;re going to have to kidnap a couple people.&#34;</p>
