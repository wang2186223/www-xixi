                <p>Ivan left to go get us food and I had an idea. I wanted to see if Keo and I could progress our communication through our link and see if we could try to open the door to be able to switch. I tried to pull Keo&#39;s consciousness to me. I thought of how he walked and talked. I thought of how he stood and how tall he was. I thought of the details I could remember of him as I pulled at his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ari, is that you?* Keo asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yup. I&#39;m trying to see you.* I giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Is Ivan there?* Keo laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Nope. Trying to figure this out before he gets here.* I laughed with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Devious. I love it. Give me a second. Let me tell Drake so they don&#39;t freak out if I suddenly drop to the ground. I think I know how this works. Try doing what you were doing again in 15 seconds.* Keo told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Let&#39;s try something else instead of severing the connection.* I told him.</p>

                <p>I pulled at Drake and Caleb&#39;s mind in the same way that I pulled at Keo&#39;s before we were able to talk. Caleb started to appear before me in the same way that he had when I had fed on him after I turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb!&#34; I jumped excitedly and ran to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya! It&#39;s so good to see you again! Are you ok? How has everything been? Have they done anything yet?&#34; Caleb asked, hugging me tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ok, Caleb. They haven&#39;t done anything too crazy. I get the feeling that Boss is going to start getting impatient soon though. I miss you!&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*How did? What? Are you and Caleb face to face?* Keo asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb and I looked up when Keo spoke. It sounded like a voice overhead. We both looked at each other and started laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s so crazy! Keo, you sound like you&#39;re on an overhead speaker. But yes, we&#39;re face to face.&#34; Caleb called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*We can hear you like normal, Caleb.* Drake laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do we get you both in here?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Try doing what you did again. Caleb was the only one that seemed to accept it. We&#39;re going to sever the connection for a second so we can put up a barrier just in case. But try it again.* Drake told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know what&#39;s going on where you&#39;re at right now? Are you aware of your surroundings?&#34; I asked Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb put his hand on his chin and looked at the ground. It was like he was trying to get in tune with himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vaguely. I have to really focus. Ariya, is it safe for you to be doing this right now? Where&#39;s Ivan?&#34; Caleb asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s getting food. I just wanted to try it. Let me see about bringing Keo and Drake here.&#34; I held my arms out in front of me and once again I thought about pulling Drake and Keo to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake and Keo started to materialize in front of Caleb and I. Caleb jumped back, his eyes wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is so crazy!&#34; Caleb said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you doing this, Ari?&#34; Keo asked me, his eyes wide in wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you feel the difference this time, Keo?&#34; Drake laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a pull instead of a push.&#34; Keo said, making the connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think there&#39;s a lot more we can do.&#34; I told him, &#34;If we both pull I think we can swap places. But if I push myself to you, I think I can possibly make a projection of myself. I&#39;m not completely sure. It&#39;s just a thought but I don&#39;t know how we actually take over. Right now all of you are in my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake walked over and hugged me. I stood there, shocked at first but then hugged him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not sure what I did to get a hug.&#34; I said, awkwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake laughed, &#34;You are you. More than I ever thought. I thought when we all reconnected and you and Caleb were back that you both would somehow be different. I kinda expected you to be a lot different than you used to be just because of who you&#39;ve been around. But I&#39;m so happy to see you as well, you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cocked my head to the side, confused, &#34;I mean don&#39;t get me wrong, there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s happened. But I&#39;m always going to be me. I choose who I am going to be. Not anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True, but people can influence you and to see you still so inventive and creative and just being devious like you and your brother always have been. It&#39;s good to see.&#34; Drake told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s right, Ari. I was a little nervous as well. We&#39;ve all been apart for so long. But even Ivan seems to still be Ivan.&#34; Keo said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems to be? Are you expecting us to change?&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not even a little bit.&#34; Keo laughed, coming over and hugging me as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya, I think you can make it to where we can see what&#39;s going on where you&#39;re at, I think you just have to focus.&#34; Drake told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my arms out in front of me once again, trying to think of seeing what was going on around me. I thought of it like a movie that everyone could see. My energy manipulation formed a huge rectangle just like a projector screen in front of all of us. After focusing a bit more the image appeared on the makeshift screen and we could all see what my eyes could see in real time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s amazing!&#34; Caleb gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we able to move around and see around you or talk to anyone that is there?&#34; Keo grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not sure honestly.&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think only one person can be the one that controls your body at a time, Ariya. I also don&#39;t think Caleb or I could do it. I think it has to be you or Keo. But we might as well give it a shot.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So we need to create a spot that basically is the place where whoever is on that spot is the one that&#39;s in control of movement and hopefully speech? The rest of us can watch like we&#39;re watching a movie?&#34; Keo asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something like that I&#39;m sure.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried making a platform which failed. Keo tried, but failed. We tried a few other ideas which all failed. When I was about to give up for the moment, Caleb interrupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariya, how did you bring everyone here?&#34; Caleb asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just thought about how you all looked and details about you and tried to pull you here.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was it the same with you bringing yourself here?&#34; Caleb asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pretty much. I thought of the area that I wanted us to be in. I just figured a plain room. It made it easier to think of the details of all of you. But when I was thinking of bringing myself here I just did the same thing as I did with all of you.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you thinking what I&#39;m thinking?&#34; Keo said, looking at me grinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Probably something close to it.&#34; I laughed.</p>
