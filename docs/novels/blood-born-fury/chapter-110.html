                <p>I looked at Boss as he walked up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes I forget that Ryker is the one that trained you.&#34; Boss told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked, &#34;You said to break her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss laughed, &#34;I did. But now she can&#39;t fight the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure we can fix her up if you want her to fight.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss nodded, &#34;Do it. Oh and Justin, I know you&#39;ve been focused on the fight but do look around. Their faces are entertaining. I think they&#39;re even more scared of you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did as he said and saw the multitude of horrified and shocked expressions surrounding us. Boss had been off to the side and slightly under the stands. I was sure that no one had seen him use his ability. But I couldn&#39;t help but wonder. I caught Mya and Leo&#39;s expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should we have those 2 come down and help out? She can&#39;t exactly tell me where all the breaks are right now.&#34; I asked Boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. It might add to their horror when they realize.&#34; Boss snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I motioned for Leo and Mya to come down here and they moved quickly. I flipped Ariya over so she was on her back as we waited for Leo and Mya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry for breaking the Escrima sticks.&#34; I told Boss as I handed them back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss chuckled, &#34;I&#39;m glad you did break them. They&#39;re not easily broken which adds to the message. Though you almost nailed me with one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my eyebrow, &#34;Did I? It looked more like you stopped it. Regardless, I&#39;m sorry for almost hitting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss laughed, &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. I think you&#39;re the only one that saw. I&#39;m sure you have questions but we&#39;ll have to talk about them later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think she saw?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss nodded, &#34;Her Dragon&#39;s eye was activated. I&#39;m sure there wasn&#39;t anything she didn&#39;t see. Aside from you and her, I doubt if anyone else saw. The match was worth watching.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We dropped the subject immediately as Mya and Leo walked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help Justin out. Tell him where things are broken and he&#39;ll set them in place. You only have to heal them if she doesn&#39;t wake up.&#34; Boss told them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a feeling she will. Setting some of these is going to be painful.&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mya and Leo went on opposite sides of Ariya. They set their hands hovering slightly over her and closed their eyes, focusing. Almost simultaneously their eyes flew open and they looked at me with horrified expressions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boss snickered and whispered in my ear, &#34;Told you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked at Boss. Then moved toward Ariya to help Mya and Leo fix her up. They stared at me, horrified by the damage that she&#39;d sustained. One look from me and they immediately turned their gaze to Ariya. Mya was over her arm, the one I knew I&#39;d broken, and looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated before speaking, &#34;Her armis broken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and moved to set Ariya&#39;s arm. It didn&#39;t take me long to do so. Ryker had taught me how to set bones during my training. It was interesting though. I didn&#39;t even think of Ryker until Boss had mentioned him. It was like my memory of Ryker had disappeared. I made a mental note to talk to Ariya and the others about it later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I fixed Ariya&#39;s arm I looked at Mya, &#34;Check and see if it&#39;s healing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes went wide and I saw Boss smirk. My usual 1 word answers to people weren&#39;t going to work all the time. They were always shocked when I said more than 1 word. Mya checked and then looked back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s healing, slowly, but it&#39;s healing. We should heal you.&#34; She said, looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Later.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of me enjoyed the pain I was feeling from my busted lip and eyebrow. I wasn&#39;t ready for the pain to be gone yet. I knew I needed to make sure they healed me because if Ari gave me any bit of her blood it would heal me automatically. I wasn&#39;t completely sure how the mate bond worked yet, but I knew that I could borrow some of her abilities. It was better to be safe than sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before we leave, one of you will heal him. I think Justin&#39;s enjoying the feeling of pain a little bit.&#34; Boss snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of their eyes widened even more which made me smirk. Boss seemed to know me really well at times. So well that I was sure he wouldn&#39;t believe I was actually Ivan unless I actually shifted in front him. We went back to fixing Ariya and sure enough she was out cold during all of it. When we got to the last break, the one on her leg, she had stopped healing. Leo and Mya had to heal the last bit of the previous breaks I&#39;d fixed. I had a feeling she&#39;d wake up with this one. The break was severe and I had to pull the bone off of itself to be able to fix it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You 2 should back up.&#34; I told Leo and Mya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both looked at me, their eyes wide but did as I told them. I pulled sharply, but before I could finish fixing Ariya&#39;s leg her eyes flew open and she bared her fangs at me, growling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes refocused as she regained her control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Don&#39;t forget your eyes won&#39;t stay red, Ari.* I warned her in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Right.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya closed her eyes shut as she took deep breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to finish fixing your leg. Are you ready?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya nodded but didn&#39;t speak. I pulled sharply at her leg and she screamed in pain as I reset it. Her eyes remained shut tight and her breathing picked up. Boss tossed a blood bag at her that landed in her lap. She opened her eyes and snatched it up, biting into it greedily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your number at Ariya?&#34; Boss asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya finished off the blood bag and looked at Boss. Her eyes had gone back to normal and her fangs had receded. She was in control from what I could tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;4 now.&#34; Ariya told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll get 1 more then. Justin will give you another after as long as you do what you&#39;re told.&#34; Boss said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that he was talking about winning the fights against Jess and Adam. I wasn&#39;t sure if Link would try to fight or if he&#39;d stay put. Regardless, Ariya had to win the fights coming. Boss gave her another blood bag and I took the opportunity to talk to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Are you ok, Ari?* I asked her in our head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I will be. We&#39;ll have to talk about everything later. I want you to show me some stuff but if you do it now I don&#39;t know that I will be able to hide my expressions.* She told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*That&#39;s fair. AriI&#39;m sorry.* I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Don&#39;t be. I knew what was coming. We had to. As long as it looked right then it was worth it.* She reassured me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I think it did. Boss doesn&#39;t seem suspicious in the slightest.* I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Good because you&#39;re probably going to have to dig for some information. I don&#39;t know if you noticed but Boss has more than 1 ability.* She said, worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I saw. He knows we saw it. We&#39;ll talk to him after this, I&#39;m sure.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*How many abilities do you think he has?* She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*A lot more than 2. I can&#39;t be sure. But Ari, you realize, we&#39;re not going to get out of here any time soon, right?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*That&#39;s what I&#39;m worried about.*</p>
