                <p>I woke up with a start as my eyes flew open. Drake, Keo and Caleb surrounded me with worried looks on their faces. I was breathing heavily trying to remember what happened when it hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ari?* I asked, worried about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m here. Are you ok?* She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I am now.* I said, relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened? You just passed out suddenly and I tried to reach Ari and it was like she was blocked.&#34; Keo asked, worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry. My parents wanted to talk to us about the mate bond. Apparently we needed to be unconscious for that.&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your parents? What?&#34; Caleb asked, shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Umm. Right. So Ari and Keo&#39;s Mom did something when my parents died. It was in case I was mated and long story short they were able to explain things to us about the mate bond.&#34; I explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;m more confused.&#34; Caleb said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll try to explain it later, Caleb. Right now, Ivan needs to get home and sleep. He&#39;s gotta get back in the morning and he was out for a little while out here.&#34; Drake intervened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Drake, &#34;Thanks. I&#39;m sorry for the trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. They were able to tell me they were taking you for a moment beforehand. It was still freaky. They said they would fix the lock. I take it they did?&#34; Drake asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. At least I think so. There was a lot they explained. I think I&#39;m still trying to absorb everything. But we should be good on that front. There&#39;s a bit more, they were able to give Ariya and I back some of our memories. Not any of the important or super emotional ones but the rest we have.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that&#39;s a good thing for us, not so much for Boss. I don&#39;t know how much Boss is going to like that he doesn&#39;t have anything useful.&#34; Drake said, worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled, &#34;He better get over it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just be prepared, Ivan. He might not react so well. You need to get home and get some sleep though. We can make a plan tomorrow.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, put my shirt and shoes back on and headed towards home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You ok, princess?* I asked Ariya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m hungry and really tired. I think your tiredness is rubbing off on me though.* Ariya told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yeah. I feel like I&#39;m going to pass out. Is that what the other feeling is? Your hunger?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yeah. I&#39;m sorry. I wish you didn&#39;t have to feel it. I try to ignore it more than anything. But it&#39;s getting worse.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Don&#39;t be sorry, Ari. It&#39;s ok. First thing tomorrow when I get there, put a barrier up and feed from me. Take as much as you need. I can handle it.* I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the desire that Ariya felt to feed strengthen and I realized I probably should have waited to say something. I could feel her canines ache as if they were my own. My body shivered and I felt my eyes switch to my wolf eyes. I felt Ariya&#39;s desire to feed fade and confusion take its place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What was that?* Ariya asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*My wolf is responding to you.* I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*That felt weird. Like you wanted it to be able to happen now.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I do, princess. But I&#39;m not next to you.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Tomorrow though.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yes, tomorrow for sure.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed to make it home and started pulling my clothes off. Throwing them in the laundry. I could feel Ariya&#39;s curiosity peak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, *I need to shower. You know, after the running, rolling around in the dirt, fighting Caleb for fun.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Don&#39;t mind me. I&#39;m just here for the ride.* Ariya laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*No funny business, princess. I&#39;m exhausted.* I laughed, hopping into the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ok, so how about we go over what your Mom and Dad said?* Ariya offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*We should try to figure out the ability thing as soon as possible. It could give us an edge when we try to escape.* I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Definitely. It is something that I need to work on, but I also need to remember what it&#39;s like to do anything for the first time. Boss might eventually see me using my abilities. It&#39;s better if he thinks I&#39;m doing something for the first time over actually mastering it already.* Ariya said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I agree. I&#39;m also going to need you to teach me how to use them at times too. Which means we&#39;re going to have to figure out how to practice it together.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I think it might make sense to see Drake, Keo, and Caleb more often. You could practice what you learn with them, they could teach you some things and then because I&#39;m with you, I can also learn at the same time. I&#39;ll have to practice in person. But maybe I can switch places with Keo and try it here and there.* Ariya said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I wonder if we can switch places.* I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I never thought of that. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible but it&#39;s worth a shot to try. But Ivan, we&#39;re going to have to figure out how to get it to where we can fight each other a bit.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled, *I don&#39;t like it much. I don&#39;t want to fight you. I don&#39;t want us to hurt each other. But I get it. It&#39;s the only way to hone our skills. Boss did say I would get my own day to basically do whatever I wanted. Maybe with his new idea I&#39;ll still get that day. We could train if no one is around.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I know you don&#39;t like it but if the opportunity comes up, don&#39;t hold back. I can take it, remember.  Besides, if anyone is around and you hold back they might figure out that you&#39;re Ivan.* Ariya said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have that luxury, Ari. I&#39;m not me when others are around. It&#39;s going to be Justin that fights you.* I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Then I&#39;ll have to fight hard against you when you&#39;re Justin.* Ariya giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*If he hurts you* I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Then I&#39;ll learn something and you can teach me how to counter later.* Ariya told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I just wish that part of me was gone. Then I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about it.* I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yeah but if Justin was gone, then that means you are the one that will have to hurt me.* Ariya countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart broke. I knew she was right. I couldn&#39;t hurt her though. Did that mean they would figure out who I was? If that happened then they would torture her in front of me. I wouldn&#39;t be able to protect her. What was worse? Being the one to hurt her or watching her get hurt? I hated this. I felt my anger rise. As fast as it rose, I felt Ariya trying to calm me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan, I would rather you end up breaking a bone or knocking me out because we&#39;re trying to make me stronger than to risk you getting found out and then us never getting out of this place. I have to get used to the feeling anyway. The more often it happens, the more I&#39;ll be able to deal with the pain. It&#39;s temporary for us. It doesn&#39;t last. If I can fight through that pain or even fight when things are broken, then no one can beat us.* Ariya said, trying to comfort me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I don&#39;t want you to ever be scared of me though. I&#39;m not trying to hurt you and make you think I&#39;m only ever going to do that.* I said, sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I won&#39;t. I know you love me. I know you wouldn&#39;t do anything that I&#39;m not consenting to. But if Boss decides on torture, you have to do what he says. We will figure it out as it comes. For now, it&#39;s not something to worry about. Justin is the one that will be doing the harm. Not you.*</p>
