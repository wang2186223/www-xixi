                <p>&#34;Think of it like you&#39;re protecting me. It might make it easier.&#34; Ariya said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing is going to make breaking your bones easier on me, Ari. It&#39;s not right. I&#39;m not supposed to hurt you.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Breathe, Ivan. It&#39;s ok. By doing this, you will be protecting me. You&#39;ll also be training me. I have to learn to be able to get through the pain without struggling. It&#39;s only temporary.&#34; Ariya told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes flew open and I gasped taking in a large amount of air. We were back in the room. Ariya healed me and went to pull away but I wrapped my arms tightly around her. I buried my head into her breathing her in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I&#39;ll do it. But Ari, I&#39;m never going to hurt you like that again after this.&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will if Boss orders you to.&#34; She told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled, &#34;Only when he orders and only if it&#39;s to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let her go enough to look her dead in the eyes. My wolf eyes, glowing. Ariya&#39;s eyes glowed back at me, matching my own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Until we&#39;re out of here. But after that, never again.&#34; I vowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan, you know you&#39;re not the one that&#39;s actually hurting me right? It&#39;s going to be Justin.&#34; Ariya told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Justin is me. As much as I hate to admit it.&#34; I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not though. You and Justin are basically 2 different people. You just share the same face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And memory. At least on my side. I have all of his memories.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya softened. She knew I was right. She knew I hated it. That the mate bond made me want to rip my own throat out. But I knew she was right too. About needing to do it to protect her. Ariya finished eating her food. We still had a small window of time before we had to go. I just wanted to hold her in my arms until we had to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing what I wanted, Ariya curled up in my lap and let me hold her. I realized that she needed it just as much as I did. I looked down at her, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it, Ari?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m nervous about the fight. Not about our part of it. I&#39;m actually kind of excited about that. Even though I know it&#39;s going to hurt. I&#39;m excited to spar with you. I&#39;m excited to learn what I can from you. But I&#39;m worried about not being able to overpower the others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, &#34;Ari, you have always been stronger than the rest of them. I don&#39;t have a doubt in my mind that you won&#39;t be able to beat them as well. Even after we fight. Oh and Ari, we can spar whenever. I&#39;m just not willing to break bones or hurt you during it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, it might happen by accident, right?&#34; She asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it won&#39;t, because I can pull a hit if I need to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t pull your hits during this one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t. I&#39;ll do what I need to. I&#39;ll probably need some reassurance after though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya giggled then became serious, &#34;Ivan, what if Boss makes me fight them all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Use your eyes, princess. You&#39;re faster and stronger than all of them now. Take one out at a time. Use your energy manipulation too.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My vampire eyes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your dragon&#39;s eye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes went wide, &#34;I forgot about that. I always forget about that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked, &#34;You guys usually do. It&#39;s an ability that I never understood why you guys didn&#39;t use as much. But I think if used, it can be more useful than you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll need to use the energy manipulation during our fight huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked again, &#34;You can try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, so you think you&#39;re fast enough to prevent me from being able to use it?&#34; Ariya laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guess we&#39;ll find out. That&#39;s something I need to be able to do though. If I can&#39;t, that is. Otherwise, you&#39;ll easily overpower me once you get the hang of using it. Boss will realize that too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I guess we better amp you up.&#34; Ariya grinned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya&#39;s eyes changed to her vampire eyes and her fangs pushed their way forward. She slit her tongue with her teeth and then kissed me. I deepened the kiss as my tongue intertwined with hers. The electricity flowed through me, exciting my cells. My eyes flew open as they changed and we separated, both of us panting, trying to catch our breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s really intense every time.&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariya grinned, &#34;Let&#39;s show them a good fight then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got up and got ready to leave. I knew as soon as I opened the door my hair was going to change back and I would be Justin again. I wished I wouldn&#39;t be. I didn&#39;t want to hurt Ariya, but I didn&#39;t like the idea that I was going to hurt her as Justin. I was sure there would be Shadows following us to the arena. I looked back at Ariya and took her face in my hands. I kissed her as passionately as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;ll talk to you soon, princess.* I told her through our link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I love you, Ivan.* She told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I love you, Ari.* I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I severed the connection and opened the door to the room. My hair changed back instantly and I felt that same feeling that something was different. I had Ariya walk about half a foot in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No sudden moves and you stay out or restraints.&#34; I told her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll behave. I haven&#39;t given you or Boss a reason to believe I won&#39;t yet.&#34; Ariya said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked but masked it quickly. She was always really direct with her comments at me. Especially when I was Justin. The realization hit me and I had to focus hard on making sure I didn&#39;t change my facial expressions. I didn&#39;t know who might be watching right now. When I was Justinthat was my last thought. Who am I?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My name is Ivan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit.</p>
