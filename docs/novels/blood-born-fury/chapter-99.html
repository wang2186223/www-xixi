                <p>chapter Ninety Nine</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got my clothes back on, gave Ariya one more kiss and told her I would talk to her soon. I was happy I was going to be able to talk to her when I was away from the facility and anytime no one was around. It meant that I would be able to know she was ok instead of wondering when I got back if Boss had gone in while I was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the room and felt my memories fade and my hair changed as usual. But this time something felt different. I wasn&#39;t sure what it was but something was different. I made a mental note and ignored the feeling and continued heading toward the front of the building. I never usually ran into anyone after hours. The only people I would run into were the guards on the way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out for the night, sir?&#34; One of the Guards asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup.&#34; I answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have a good night.&#34; The same guard responded as I left the building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the most conversation that they ever usually gave me. Except for that one guard that wanted to talk to me a while ago. The others fixed him pretty quickly. Everyone let me be. Must be my cheerful demeanor. I would answer their question if I was out for the night because they were usually trying to make sure they didn&#39;t have to worry about anyone coming in. They usually only saw people leave and weren&#39;t completely sure what to do when someone was coming in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way down the street. I sniffed the air as my hair changed back to the white tips. I wasn&#39;t sure why I could feel that happen but I could. My body shivered and I felt the urge to shift. I smirked, Ari would want to feel it. But I didn&#39;t have a way to keep my shirt and shoes if I shifted now. I sniffed the air and tried to locate anyone that might be nearby. No one. The place was like a ghost town. There weren&#39;t many people that ran around as it was but especially at night, no one was ever running around. I liked leaving late and usually left later so I could avoid people. Well all but a few people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Hey, princess.* I reached out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a warmth spread through me as I felt her emotions coming to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*That was quick. Did you mean mug everyone?* Ariya giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*No one is usually there, only the night guards. But yes. Everyone usually gets mean mugged.* I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Where are you at now? Anywhere near the forest?* She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I can be there pretty quick. What do you have planned, princess?* I asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her feel nervous for a moment before she spoke, *I reached out to Drake. I&#39;m worried about the Justin thing we talked about.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You don&#39;t have to be worried about my reactions, Ari. I understand and I&#39;m not going to be mad about it. You&#39;re the only one that can reach out to Drake and them right now. I&#39;m going to have to work on it, but just at a different time. How long before Drake&#39;s in the forest?* I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Not long I think. I just wasn&#39;t sure if you&#39;d be upset. I know you&#39;re tired.* Ariya said, sheepishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I am tired but you gave me a jolt of energy earlier, remember? No worries. I can handle it. Besides, this is important. It needs to be taken care of. Preferably before I end up in front of Boss as Justin. Something felt different earlier anyway. Is Drake the only one coming or are Keo and Caleb coming too?* I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I think all 3. The only reason why it was just Drake last time is because I asked him to be the only one. I didn&#39;t know if you wanted to talk to him more and I wasn&#39;t sure you wanted to announce to my brother that you had to have sex with his sister to complete the mate bond.* She laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Yeah. I mean I know Keo is happy about us but I don&#39;t think he wants to know that or even think about that happening.* I laughed. *I&#39;m glad that Caleb and Keo are coming. I wanna show you something. Don&#39;t read into that. It&#39;s supposed to be a surprise.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I don&#39;t know how well surprises are going to go with us. We can feel what each other feels and we know each other&#39;s thoughts.* Ariya laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*True, but I&#39;m doing my best not to think about it. You&#39;re not helping in that category* I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I think it&#39;s your wolf that&#39;s making it harder to not think about. I can feel it itching to come out.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Well I guess the surprise is out. You&#39;re not wrong though.* I said as my body shivered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Whoa. That feels weird. Does it always feel like that?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Only when I really need to shift. It gets worse though. I&#39;m almost in the forest. Hopefully Drake or Keo are already there, they can take my shirt and shoes for me.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Why do you need to shift? Is everything ok?* Ari asked, worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breathing started to pick up as I felt my wolf claw at me wanting desperately to be let free. I wasn&#39;t sure what was going on. Was it the mate bond? Was it the last part that needed to happen that we didn&#39;t know about? I stumbled into the forest and pulled my shirt over my head. I felt my body start to expand as my wolf was trying to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan?* Ariya called me, worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kicked my shoes off and fell to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening.* I gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan? Are you ok?&#34; Drake asked, putting a hand on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. What&#39;s happening?&#34; I gasped, trying to hold back from shifting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you guys bond? If you did, you need to shift. Now. Your wolf needs to run. It happened to me too. Come on, I&#39;ll go with you.&#34; Caleb told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s right, Ivan. If you guys bonded, your wolf needs to come out. Things are different now and your wolf has to come out to have the change happen too. Especially after being drained. Derek had to shift if I took a lot. It just happens. Don&#39;t fight it. You&#39;ll only make it worse.&#34; Drake told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, *I&#39;m sorry, princess. I didn&#39;t want you to feel it this way. It&#39;s not always this bad. Are you ready? It&#39;s going to happen all at once and fast too.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m ready. Please shift, I don&#39;t want you to continue being in pain.* Ariya told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb. Race.&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re on!&#34; Caleb jumped up excited, pulling his shirt and shoes off as fast as he could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body convulsed violently and a loud growl ripped from my throat. I felt my muscles contract and my body expand as I shifted into my wolf form. A scorching hot feeling hit my left shoulder. It felt like I was being branded and I yelped in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ivan! Are you ok?* Ariya screamed in my head, worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Something&#39;s burning me!* I yelped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the sensation coming from Ariya as well and the panic hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Ariya! What&#39;s happening on your end?* I screamed, scared that someone was hurting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It&#39;s ok! I&#39;m ok! It&#39;s burning on me too! I don&#39;t knowthe mark! You said something about us having a mark each. Maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s going on?* She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to take a step and fell over. Drake, Keo, and Caleb were at my side instantly. Caleb whined and nudged me with his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan, it&#39;s ok. Breathe. It&#39;s not going to last forever. I think it&#39;s from the bond.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This didn&#39;t happen when Caleb and I bonded. Why is it happening with Ivan?&#34; Keo asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Theirs is a mate bond, it&#39;s different from your bond with Caleb.&#34; Drake explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I think you&#39;re right, princess. I wish we knew this was going to hurt so bad. Are you ok?* I asked, more worried about her than the pain I felt on my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m ok, the pain is starting to go away. How are you? If you knew the pain was going to come, would you have chosen not to bond?* Ari asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growled in response, *Absolutely I would have bonded with you. I just wished we were mentally prepared for the pain, that&#39;s all. It&#39;s the same way for me. The pain is going away.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well if there was ever a doubt on who you were, Ivan, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s even more obvious now.&#34; Keo laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snorted at him in response, unsure of what he meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drake laughed, &#34;You have a new design in your fur is the best way to put it. You still have black fur with white tips all over but you now have a white design that goes on your shoulder and down your arm a little bit. It&#39;s kinda tribal, swirly looking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started to worry as Ariya voiced the question that I was wondering, *Is that going to stay when you shift back? Are they going to be able to tell?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body shivered as I shifted back to my human form, &#34;Is it still there? How far does it stretch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy. You have to finish shifting back. Turn around. It sticks to your shoulder blade and that&#39;s it. It doesn&#39;t hit your neck or anything. Basically as long as they don&#39;t make you take your shirt off you should be fine. Even if you wear short sleeves. If you ever have to take your shirt off you&#39;re screwed but you&#39;d be screwed regardless. Unless you wanna start getting a bunch of tattoos to help camouflage it.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, relieved, &#34;I&#39;m not worried about it. We knew I was going to have a mark that was visible but just worried when you said it went down my arm while I was a wolf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body shivered again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*You didn&#39;t run.* Ariya laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to run before we do anything. Caleb. This time it&#39;s on.&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go, we&#39;ll wait here. We have your guy&#39;s clothes.&#34; Drake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*This is how it should feel to shift, princess.* I told her, hoping she could feel every bit of the shift this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body shivered and expanded. I jumped forward as I shifted, landing on all 4 paws. I dug into the ground, launching myself forward. I could feel the wind lick at my fur as I ran. I howled happily as I ran through the night, racing Caleb to see who could go faster for longer. I heard Ariya giggle in my head as she felt what I was feeling.</p>
