                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Next day...*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flights always got me comfortable. And sitting in my brother-in-law&#39;s plane, I was grateful for the reprieve. At least I didn&#39;t have to go through the discomforts of commercial flights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside me sat my mum, who yapped with my sister about different topics. They had an enviable relationship, where they shared common interests; beauty, fashion and a lavish life. A trait which I didn&#39;t share with Mum. Mum always told me that I was more like my late dad, loving the arts and serenity. I suddenly wondered if that was the reason she had met and married Alan Preston in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was rich as Croesus and had all the fame. And now, knowing they had dirt in their hands, I didn&#39;t know what to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Did it mean they were all just living a pretentious life?* I wondered. Even my boss, Claudine. The woman had made all that money by illicit means. Having dirt as well. Silently, I watched them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright, Kenya?&#34; Alan asked me, over his glass of wine. His handsome face, kind. I shifted, uncomfortably. I hadn&#39;t been aware that I was staring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Kenya. You have been awfully quiet, for someone who had a beautiful debut as the star ballerina last night.&#34; Amanda added, concerned. I stared, tears spilling over as I recalled my sister&#39;s love for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh it&#39;s nothing...I was just overwhelmed by your love for me.&#34; I lied, pasting a false smile. Mum smiled with warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh honey. We love you so much. You don&#39;t need to cry, and we are very proud of you.&#34; Mum held me, affectionately. I returned the embrace, smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Ken, we love you OK. Never forget that.&#34; Amanda, who sat beside her husband from Alan, admitted. &#34;And so you know how proud we are, I just heard that your face is currently in Times Square as the star ballerina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared, awestruck. &#34;How?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; Amanda said, smiling. &#34;But I bet it has something to do with your current boyfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Levi Ruthford.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda teased. Her eyes, glinting with pride. I winced at the sound of Levi&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s...he&#39;s...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh honey. Whatever you are doing with him, continue. You have my full support. Just don&#39;t let him slip.&#34; Amanda urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey...&#34; Alan cautioned, softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, baby? I want my sister to have the best as well.&#34; Amanda cooed as she kissed her husband. Love, evident between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pay her no mind, Kenya. We all love you, no matter who you are.&#34; Alan smiled at me, kindly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I equally smiled, my heart wrenching. Gosh, I loved them so much. And now, due to my foolish encouragement of Levi, they faced ruination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Marriage. A* shudder ran through my entire body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a proposition for you, if you are so inclined.&#34; Alan&#39;s voice broke into my thoughts. &#34;I have a spot for a ballerina on my upcoming movie project and I need the next best thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stared at Alan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your sister never told me that you danced well. I would have offered you the spot. But now I know, I was wondering, would you like to take the role?&#34; Alan asked, smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked. Mum and Amanda smiled, encouraging me to agree. Would he have noticed me if Levi hadn&#39;t bought the spot for me?* I wondered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Until Levi came into my life, I was just Amanda&#39;s baby sister. Now I was noticed.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing their expectant gazes, I answered, &#34;I&#39;d think about it, Alan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was night as I lay in one of the rooms of Mum&#39;s Malibu beach house. A modern apartment, gifted to Mum by my sister on one of her birthdays that had all the luxury and glam. The sea, a welcome neighbor. It&#39;s saltiness, filled my nostrils. Pleasant, peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we were younger, Amanda had started working early to help Mum in household expenses. She had even abandoned furthering her studies after high school. Her focus on work, to help me, with my schooling. Especially once I got admitted to Manhattan school of the Arts, on scholarship. She worked nights, tirelessly. And when Alan had come to marry her, we had seen him as her knight in shining armor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, two kids later, they were still in love. And I couldn&#39;t do otherwise but uphold that love, no matter the cost. Even though I had to run forever, from Levi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Levi left my place that night, I had cried myself to sleep. I had ignored Dave&#39;s calls and his subsequent text, which informed me that I was to be placed in Times Square. Even calls from my friends. I was sorrowful and had fallen asleep, pain killing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Early this morning, I woke up with a bright idea. I called Alan, seeking permission to board the flight with them. Enthusiastic, he had agreed and even sent his driver for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without informing anyone, I bailed out on Levi. Hoping to find a solution, before he realizes my absence. I didn&#39;t think of anything. I only wanted this to end. So here I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier this evening at dinner, Alan called to thank me for accepting the role. I was confused, because I hadn&#39;t given it any thought, since Mum and I arrived her place. He later filled me in, that Amanda had conveyed my acquiescence to him. Furious, I called my sister to vent all my frustration. She only laughed, mischievously. Her assurance that I would thank her later, irking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did my life still belong to me, I wondered, as I lay in bed. The wind picked up, curtains blowing softly into the room. The night was dark, beautiful. The swooshing sound of the waves, a lullaby. A comfort to my troubled soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what tomorrow had in store for me. I had no life to return to. I had to escape Levi. Or face marriage to that vile man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An option I would never consider.</p>
