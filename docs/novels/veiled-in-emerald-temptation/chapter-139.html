                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Tuesday, 12 hours later***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes and looked around. I was in our room in the Pent house. Levi lay beside me, watching me like a hawk. I smiled weakly, wondering if he had slept a wink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We returned from the hospital eight hours ago. I had fallen asleep immediately in Levi&#39;s arms. Too exhausted. I had heard his soothing words as I drifted to sleep. Lured into sleep by his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bomb got deactivated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In those few seconds Levi asked I trusted him, I had seen only him. The entire world had faded and only us remained. I had allowed his eyes encourage me, the sounds of tools and heavy breathing around us, insignificant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his friend, Albert eventually announced we were safe, it was then I breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi had pulled me in for a kiss the minute my ropes were cut. I had welcomed it, drinking him in. My elixir of life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got introduced to Albert Bethel, my husband&#39;s childhood friend, who had come to my rescue. A very handsome man as well, who I realized too late, hated handshakes. When I had extended him one, he had looked at me, guardedly. Although he had allowed a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of Albert&#39;s men and Levi&#39;s men had stayed back to handle the clean-up with the authorities, while Albert accompanied us to the hospital. On the way, I had drifted in and out of sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my semi-conscious state, I had deduced that Albert had high connections with the authorities, who had been fully aware of the entire operation to rescue me and take down the domestic terrorist, Crompton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, I had been thankful to God for the baby&#39;s safety. Levi hadn&#39;t left my side one bit. Staring at me, his fingers laced in mine. Explicit joy in his face at our wellbeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What time is it?&#34; I asked, sitting upright. I was in an ivory silk night dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi&#39;s eyes danced with mischief. His hair and bare torso, wet. Fresh from the shower, he still looked hot. How unfair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;11:40am.&#34; Levi gave. A smile in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped in surprise. &#34;What? Did I sleep that long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He broke into a laugh. The sound drawing joy from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling me into his arms, Levi growled low in my ear. Grazing my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked everyone to let you sleep, when the calls kept coming. They were all worried about you, as soon as news broke.&#34; A kiss followed those words, trailing down my neck. I moaned deeply, my nipples already aching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Oh I missed this. Him. How did I ever breathe without him?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who has been calling?&#34; I asked, through the haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He maneuvered us, until he was on top of me this time. Kissing my jawline. My neck. Avoiding the part of me that ached for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*My lips*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your mum, Amanda, Andrea, Kirsten&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Amanda&#39;s name, I suddenly grew cold. Like ice bucket over my head. I tried pulling away, but Levi stalled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Levi asked, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A drop of water from his hair fell into my face. He kissed it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amanda.&#34; I breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tender green eyes stayed on me. His sigh, deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Was that a good sigh, or a bad one?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After Belle died, I felt all degrees of emotions. Warring within myself. Questioning my choices. Dragged to that exclusive club by my friends, just to get a girl I could bang. A girl that could distract me. Back then Possess hadn&#39;t arrived New York. I paid for your sister, but I didn&#39;t sleep with her. I was too traditional to take her virginity,&#34; Levi earnestly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no sugar coating it. It was either I accepted that part of him, or I didn&#39;t. Just like he was willing to accept Alec and I in bed that night he abducted us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to hate him again. But we had endured too much for that in the last few hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And your past? How do we walk over it?&#34; I slipped out, regretfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Pause.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t.&#34; He sighed, sorrowfully. I watched him struggle. &#34;It would always be there. Hanging. The only thing is that you trust me. Trust that I wouldn&#39;t hurt you. I wouldn&#39;t hurt our family. Trust that I&#39;m capable of love, because I am.&#34; He had tears in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Levi, had tears?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ached, kissing his eyes. He watched me, profoundly. Waiting eagerly for my validation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to give him that; tell him we will be fine. We will sail through this. His past, his present. The future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead I suddenly felt nauseous and ran for the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the next few seconds, Levi was my anchor as I suffered morning sickness. I felt so sick in the stomach, so unsexy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Levi helped me clean up, he carried me to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lay me down gently, about leaving the bed, to order me breakfast, when I held him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make love to me.&#34; I requested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice low, my eyes pleading. He stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would that stop the morning sickness?&#34; He teased, a smile crinkling the corners of his eyes and lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, My love.&#34; I liked that he called me his love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slid on top of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kissing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No need for further preamble. I was as horny as fuck; from the moment I saw his bare torso.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I neared a climax, Levi stalled me, his eyes boring into me. &#34;Tell me we&#39;d be together forever, Baby.&#34; I was deep in the throes of an ecstasy. But at this moment, my words meant life to him. Hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As coherent as I could muster, I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am yours, forever, Levi.&#34; I promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes on me held onto those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One final thrust and he crashed us in a wave of ecstasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathing, our gazes locked; Levi began rocking me again, kissing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am yours, forever, Kenya.&#34;</p>
