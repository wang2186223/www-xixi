                <p>***Kenya***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dropping our things at the enormous and lavishly furnished beach house, Levi took us to a nearby restaurant to have breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had hurried out of the penthouse, earlier this morning, because Levi had some files to pick up at the office, before we boarded the plane. I had only kicked back in the car and watched him do his business, while I basked in his presence. Anything to stay close to him. Weird right. But I didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t heard from my mystery friend, K.C in a while, so I had texted him, before we climbed the plane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now as we sat in the elite, ocean view restaurant, *Flamingo*, my phone buzzed on the table with an incoming text from him. I picked the phone, my heart buzzing with adrenaline at the danger of texting another man in my husband&#39;s presence. It was daring and weird. And it got me extremely exhilarated. I wondered what Levi would think if he found out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***K.C: Hey beautiful. How have you been? I have been extremely busy and haven&#39;t had any time for myself. I should have texted you, but I didn&#39;t want to be a bother.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: You are never a bother, K. C. Actually, you are a distraction.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was typing and I eagerly waited for his next words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***K.C: I hope I&#39;m much of a distraction to you?***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stilled. Those words reminding me of my question to Levi, when he first came to my house, months ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;*You have been a great distraction,&#39;* he had replied on that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shuddered and raised my eyes to Levi. He had his hands on his tablet and was making a call. I didn&#39;t even care to know what he was speaking about. Something about ordering materials for road repair in Boston.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: You&#39;re a great distraction at the moment***. ***Anything to keep me from crying my eyes to sleep out of boredom***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready to order?&#34; I heard Levi say. I looked up from my phone, my smile dying at his expressionless face. I nodded, because that was easier than speaking to him these days. He cocked his head, I wondered why, before he signaled for a waiter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What would you like?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around, sizing the uniqueness of the place. Everyone dressed casually for the warm morning, underneath the canopies. The glass tables decorated with sea side themes; corals and sea shells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;Surprise me, Levi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My response earned me another tilt of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two sea side specials, please.&#34; He informed the waiter. The man nodded and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder what got you smiling on your phone earlier. Was it one of your admirers?&#34; He asked, slyly, sipping some water. I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I do with my phone is none of your business.&#34; I threw at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is, especially if it&#39;s one of those ballet dancers. What are their names again; Rory and Mike&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re just friends Levi. And besides, Mike is in a serious relationship with Andrea,&#34; I said. *Was he serious?* This guy who had ignored me for the past days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew that. But the Rory guy?&#34; He intoned. I raised a brow at his insinuation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s got balls. I like that about him.&#34; He remarked. &#34;I&#39;ve asked my recruitment team to offer him a position at STA Constructions. My new executive P.A.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew Rory was smart and bold, but I didn&#39;t trust Levi&#39;s reasons for this offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you doing this because you need his services, or because you want to keep him under your control?&#34; I spat. He smiled darkly, confirming my suspicions. I was told how Rory boldly addressed Levi, when he had been upset. When neither Andrea nor Mike had been able to approach him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory was a people&#39;s person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to reply, when our food arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delicious foods filled my nostrils. Steak, dressed with salads and shrimps. I wasn&#39;t a fan of shrimps, but one taste of the food, I forgot our conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You like it?&#34; Levi&#39;s voice broke through the moment. My mouth stuffed, I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Silence*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one knows you own such a property in Miami.&#34; I remarked, after a while, my eyes steady on Levi. He spared me a boyish grin. *Was he shy*? I never knew that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a private person Kenya. Most of the time, I&#39;m engrossed with work,&#34; he replied. I was aware of his commitment to work and I admired him for it. His works spoke volume, the media screamed his reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MIT must be proud of one of their top students in Civil and Environmental Engineering.&#34; I complimented. He raised his eyes at me, surprised. The question of how I knew that info, in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, slyly. &#34;Nothing you wouldn&#39;t find on the internet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, amusedly, taking a bite out of his steak. &#34;You&#39;ve been checking me out, Baby?&#34; He drawled. I flushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I wanted to know more about you, since you wouldn&#39;t tell me anything.&#34; I accused. A knowing look crossed his face. Yeah I was aware, the forbidden topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I am not broaching that subject.&#34; I fixed a weary gaze on my food again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Silence*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I was able to, I got enrolled into MIT. My mother was very proud, the day I brought my enrollment details to her. Her eyes held joy for the first time in years.&#34; He started, dragging my attention. I stared at him quietly, not wanting to spoil the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mum was sick at the time with lung cancer and was undergoing treatment. Smoking. But all the money I had couldn&#39;t buy my mother&#39;s health back, like I was able to pay for my tuition fees.&#34; His sadness was palpable. I yearned to comfort him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps that&#39;s the reason I never bothered celebrating my achievements. She died a year later.&#34; He placed a wan smile, but I could still feel the ache in his heart. His sorrow, explicit.</p>
