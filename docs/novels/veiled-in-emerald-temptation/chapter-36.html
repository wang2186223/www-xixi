                <p>***Levi***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I had given her those documents, her declaration that she didn&#39;t need my money had shocked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her eyes when she stared at me, I saw something fierce, which ignited a burning desire within me. She was a spirited woman. Determined, defiant and I admired her for that. A woman who wasn&#39;t drunk about my position or my name, a first for me. Because the last I remembered, every other woman had been drawn to me because of my name and wealth, good looks aside. So faced with a woman who wasn&#39;t in the least impressed by my running figures, still stunned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The large ball room was alive with elite guests. An attendance that didn&#39;t surprise me, in spite of the short notice. Exquisitely dressed guests came over to congratulate me, unable to stop themselves from enquiring about Kenya who hadn&#39;t yet arrived. I couldn&#39;t keep my wits intact anymore. I hope she didn&#39;t ruin this night for us. Knowing her disposition towards their union, I hoped she would be kind to grace my side as my beautiful wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pleasure swirled my senses as I allowed my mind imagine what she would look like in that dress and that chain. I had been shown her selection of tonight&#39;s attire by the designer, earlier today. Her choice, teasing and seductive. Unable to stop myself, my eyes roamed the collection of jewelries that stared at me. And my eyes had caught the tiny, diamond thigh chain. The design, a perfect complement to her outfit. Something to keep my mind reeling all night. Seduced by her radiance when I wore it, I had almost taken her there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing heavily from the pool of desire that strummed in my trousers, I allowed myself listen to a few of party members that bore my mind. The instant she arrived, I felt it. The atmosphere became charged, with all eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant her eyes noticed me, she held my gaze. Our eyes locked. A flash of softness and something that bordered around uncertainty, passed those beautiful eyes of hers. My heart soared. She was tremendously stunning and I couldn&#39;t help but feel pride at being her husband. My eyes caught the chain, and desire seared in me. She was extremely stunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I noticed her eyes caught the gazes on her and her gait faltered. She missed a few steps, her limp more prominent and her steps slowing. Without a thought more, I crossed the room and was at her side in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look beautiful.&#34; My whisper grazed her right ear. One hand possessively holding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guiding her, I took her to greet all the guests that had anxiously awaited her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cameras clicked as we greeted the guests. I saw mixed feelings the guests harbored. It revolted me, but I kept my emotions in check. I knew some of my associates were prejudicial. Only related with ilks of their class. I didn&#39;t give a damn. They dared not air out their opinions, because I owned most of them. They survived on my figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were so many dignitaries; top politicians, business moguls, celebrities that attended the occasion. Even the president and his wife eventually graced the occasion! I saw Kenya&#39;s amazement. I think she finally got impressed by me, I couldn&#39;t tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello William, Grace.&#34; I greeted the President and his wife. My eyes holding warmth as we exchanged pleasantries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi, Levi. You never cease to amaze me.&#34; The President teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you both knew each other, yet you couldn&#39;t sense that he was already hitched,&#34; the first lady said, her eyes tender as she smiled at Kenya. Grace was nice. I saw her sincere adoration for Kenya already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The president&#39;s eyes shifted to Kenya, who stood quietly beside me. &#34;Mrs Ruthford. I am pleased to finally meet you, even though your husband here, never gave us any hint to this surprise.&#34; He gave me a knowing smile as he said those words. &#34;You are a delight for sore eyes. I and Grace watched your show on television, after news broke of your marriage. And I must confess, you are a beautiful dancer.&#34; The president softly remarked, his fascination vivid. I appreciated that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you are, dear. I was entranced at how you gracefully danced. I am so happy that Levi has finally found a partner. William and I had already given up hope at his ever getting settled again.&#34; The first Lady smiled at Kenya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Mr President and to you, Ma&#39;am. The pleasure is all mine.&#34; Kenya responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, drop the formality. We are practically related now.&#34; The president waved off. &#34;We must get together sometime, you know. Perhaps for a family dinner, one of these days. What say you, Grace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That would be splendid.&#34; The first lady agreed, her eyes holding her husband&#39;s with such affection. I nodded my acquiescence, my hand splayed on the small of Kenya&#39;s back. The idea, splendid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just say when and where, and we&#39;d be there.&#34; I declared, smiling warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After regretfully confessing to having other engagements, an orchestra performance, the president and his wife exited the party, followed by a throng of body guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, that went well.&#34; I muttered as I guided us to get some wine from the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi Ruthford!&#34; We heard a man&#39;sthought voice call. I instantly recognised the voice. When we turned around, two of my favorite people, strolled towards us. My excitement at their presence, explicit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Henry Macklesfield!&#34; I eagerly called back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The couple drew close, my pal and business associate, Henry Macklesfield, and his very beautiful wife, Kirsten. They were both dressed for the occasion. Their matching black outfits and the expensive diamonds that graced Kirsten, signifying the rich taste that Henry and I shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they approached, we exchanged friendly pleasantries, while the women smiled at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After I gladly made the introductions, I remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kirsten, you look beautiful.&#34; I placed a warm kiss on her cheeks.</p>
