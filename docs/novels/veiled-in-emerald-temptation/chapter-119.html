                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but identify with my character&#39;s story. Falling for a killer. Sadly, her story in the movie never gets completed. She is never found again.</p>

                <p>I was sitting outside a restaurant in Wolfe Street, distracted by the beautiful city, while I had a virtual meeting with the staff at J&#39;aime. I was in love with Baltimore and I didn&#39;t mind having a new life here. Even though a divorce was out of the question; living separate lives wasn&#39;t unheard of for Levi&#39;s ilk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, that possibility didn&#39;t sit well with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finished the meeting and I watched the videos Andrea sent me of the kids&#39; rehearsal progress. After I gave Andrea my approval on her great job, I kicked back, enjoying the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Couples walked hand in hand. Strolling to a nearby gazebo, drinking in the flower scents that graced the place. I envied them. Wondering why I couldn&#39;t have had something similar with theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t still processed the gravity of Levi&#39;s nature. I had actually expelled the thoughts, until now. It was obvious he was dangerous, but I couldn&#39;t tell the extent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shuddered at the thought of what must have happened to his first wife and the journalist. And the way he had blatantly threatened to kill my family, I had loathed and dreaded him immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, my body had needed him and that had really revolted me. How was I to contest with my simultaneous need and revulsion for him. I had simply chosen the easy way out. Run, rather than confront it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang and I knew it was another text from K.C. We were talking about cities and he seemed to love a good sun, just like me. He had no girlfriend. But he had a lover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was currently angry with him, because he had cheated on her. I felt sorry for him, because it was obvious he was a nice guy, from the way he talked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another text came into my phone and I checked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Alec: Where you at?&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The text was immediately followed by a call. I answered it, my heart thudding fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi. Have you finished your meeting for the day?&#34; Alec asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at his attentiveness. I had informed him yesterday over the phone, that I had a meeting with Andrea and he had given me pointers on our agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, Alec. I&#39;m just sitting at Lake Restaurant in Wolfe Street, enjoying the view of the gazebo.&#34; I informed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could hear him fumbling with keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great. Just perch there longer, I&#39;d be right there. My workplace is just 9 minutes away.&#34; I heard him shut the car door, before he hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My insides swarm, as I checked myself in my mirror. Alec was really a nice guy. Charming, easy to talk to. And he had this knack for encouraging others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to his word, he strolled to me, under fifteen minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34; He leaned over the table, kissing my cheek. That was the first time he was doing that. His lips felt warm, soft against my skin. I fought myself from touching the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, the gazebo, huh?&#34; His eyes stretched across the lawn. &#34;I hear couples talk about it a lot. A magical place. It&#39;s fabled that the gazebo was built from the wood of a love tree. A tree which was special to Freya and Frigga; goddesses of love and marriage.&#34; He turned back to me. His eyes held a glint. Wearing casual green T shirt and black denims. Hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face heated under his intense gaze, like back in highschool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t really believe that stuff, do you?&#34; I asked. He cocked a silly brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then we heard a scream behind us and a thud, dragging our attention. Turning around, we saw a woman slumped on the floor. Crowd already gathered and someone was calling for a doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, Alec was beside the woman, checking her pulse. He did a lot of first aid stuff on the woman, asking me to call 911. He asked her friend questions, about the lady&#39;s medical history. 911 answered and questions they asked, about the woman&#39;s state, Alec efficiently responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, she had an allergic reaction, but without the necessary equipment, Alec could only keep her pulse up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While we waited for the ambulance to arrive, he didn&#39;t even say a word. He only sternly watched the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t think I had ever seen a doctor in action before. This was a first for me and I found it really hot. Focused, undistracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was really a hot doctor at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my head, I tried to focus on the problem at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ambulance arrived shortly, and Alec immediately deferred to them. I stared at him. Finding that highly modest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had heard of some of his colleagues on an emergency scene, who usually scuffled with the paramedics. This was another side to Alec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the ambulance left with the patient, we returned to our seats. I was unable to hide my admiration for him and he caught me staring. His face instantly flushed red, under my eyes. We both laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should we walk to the gazebo?&#34; I asked, boldly. There was something magical in this moment, which I didn&#39;t want to end. Just us, locking out the entire world and its distraction. Fishing for solace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me, head tilted. I could see that he wrestled within himself and I suddenly regretted my request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hiding my disappointment, I picked up my glass of water, sipping it. Painstakingly avoiding Alec&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d love to come to the gazebo with you.&#34; His voice, a warm caress. Seductive, electric. But something else lurked in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if we do, there&#39;s no turning back for either of us.&#34;</p>
