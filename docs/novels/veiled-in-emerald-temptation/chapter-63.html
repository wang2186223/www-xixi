                <p>***Levi.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned at his audacity. Raising myself to full height, I stood menacingly before him. His eyes grew wary. His defiance, gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t put those you care about in danger. That is what Miss Macgregor did.&#34; I delivered darkly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mike shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey man, cool it. He&#39;s her husband.&#34; Rory cautioned his friend, pulling him back. They looked frightened. Perhaps it was my expression or tone. But they all stared at me in alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry, Mr Ruthford.&#34; Andrea apologized, tearfully, breaking the awkward tension. &#34;You are right. You don&#39;t put those you care about in harm&#39;s way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps her words, or the thoughts of Kenya waking up to seeing us arguing about her, but I reined in my temper. Seeing her sincerity. Yes, I could see their devotion for her, but that didn&#39;t signify. Kenya was my wife now, end of story. *Gosh! I was acting like a controlling husband. Men I detested.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were there any serious injuries?&#34; I asked, attempting for distraction. I returned to her side. A blanket was partially draped over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just the sprain to her wrist and a small bump on her head.&#34; Andrea quietly explained. I was grateful for her presence. What if she hadn&#39;t? What if Kenya had stubbornly gone there herself. The foreman should have known better. I usually attached a strict policy to all my construction works.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*No visitors! Only workers!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was having his head for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock came and one of them opened for the doctor. &#34;Ah, Mr Ruthford. I was told that you had arrived, but I was attending to a surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rose to greet him. The others said their goodbyes, leaving us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just asking if there were any serious injuries that I should worry about. She suffered a severe head wound not too long and now&#34; My voice broke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be rest assured. We scanned for any complications. Fortunately, there are none. The sprain and the bump will be gone soonest.&#34; The doctor was sympathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why is she asleep?&#34; I asked, concerned. I went to her, checking. Her left wrist was strapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When she came in, her blood pressure was through the roof and history with the head wound. We decided to sleep induce her. But she is keenly observed. Have no anxiety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head, in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Now***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Am I having déja vu?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*It&#39;s like I had done this before. Running from Hank, Marlon and Chase. God my chest hurt. I was panting. Frightened. Hank&#39;s eyes when I bit his lower lip. I had never seen such eyes on him. He had previously plagued me to let him have me. But I always protested. Telling him unless we were married. However, he was not a marry guy. He was more of a fuck guy. With that knowledge, I had chosen not to give in. Plus, he wasn&#39;t as romantic as those telenovela soaps.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I finally reached the spot, where I could press the alarm. I didn&#39;t want them near me. I saw it in their eyes. I was naked for God&#39;s sake.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Just when I needed to press it, I felt something hit my head. Heavy, imploding everything inside my head. The object fell and broke to the floor, just as I staggered, my senses shrilling. Sharp pain, through my head and body. I didn&#39;t want to end up being these men&#39;s meat. I had heard about girl&#39;s been gang raped before. And I didn&#39;t want it. Not like thisGod, please not like this. I fell.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I tried to lift my arm, to touch the ache in my head. It hurt so bad, but I couldn&#39;t. My eyes grew dark, slowly. My life ebbing away. And I wondered, if this is how everyone felt when death came. I feel hands on me. Someone slipped a rough finger into me. A dull ache, compared to the pain in my head.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*The darkness finally consumed me and I allowed it, rather than feel their touch.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Gunshots came and I heard men shouting. I wanted to open my eyes but nothing happened. For a minute I feared I was blind. And then I felt myself airlifted. I was scared. God I was going to fall. Someone was going to drop me.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Then like a caress, Levi&#39;s voice came.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;I would never let you fall,&#34; he promised*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NoNo don&#39;t let me fall. Don&#39;t let Hank get me, Levi, please. He wants to rape me. NoNo..No&#34; I writhed frantically, alarmed. My body ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shhshhbaby, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m here, baby. I&#39;m here. No one would hurt you, I promise.&#34; I heard a familiar voice I turned abruptly to the voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi, Levi...Hank is here, with Marlon and Chase. They want to rape me. He wants me, Levi. But I always told him I wanted my husband to have me first&#34; I rattled, nervously. My body ached, but I didn&#39;t care. I wanted to lift myself, so I could tell Levi everything, but pain shot through my left arm, as I pulled myself up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ow!&#34; I cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya!&#34; Levi held me, tenderly. He held my arm in his. In his eyes, I saw exhaustion, tenderness. Concern. My heart warmed. &#34;You&#39;ve had a terrible fall, baby. You fell in the construction site. And Andrea and Mr Fizz, brought you here. Your wrist is sprained and that bump in your head, at the back. Short of that baby, you are fine.&#34; He tenderly explained. My senses came together, my eyes assimilating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right. I was in a hospital ward. The crisp, white sheets. The smell of antiseptics. I remembered my fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little girl under the scaffold. Saving her. She looked so beautiful. I already got her. When I did, I saw her eyes. Levi&#39;s eyes and my lips. Holding her tiny hand, I fell and hit my hand and head. Then black out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hank is dead. Has been for days.&#34; His words shifted my focus. And I felt tears roll down my eyes.</p>
