                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Present day***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Liam Copeland? Wow*. *This man just broke me.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, mixed emotions inundating me. *Lil Freaks?* *What sort of name was that?* I swept a gaze around the dancers. I didn&#39;t even know what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Levi had two women? Mistresses*. This was doing weird things to my inside. I was battling shock, curiosity and jealously. It was all too much. And a strange welcome of naughty thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I see them?&#34; I asked, quietly. I think I was hurt. I couldn&#39;t tell. Liam gauged me, his head tilted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin pestered his lips. &#34;They&#39;re gone. He settled them both, as soon as he proposed to you.&#34; Liam revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips parted, speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I recalled, there hadn&#39;t been a proper proposal. It had been unusual. But I wasn&#39;t going to let that out. And how had this Liam guy known about that? Had Levi told him the circumstances surrounding us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over me at the absence of Levi&#39;s pair of mistresses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure I would have been able to bear their presence. Women with such sex appeal; I couldn&#39;t bear it. I was jealous. *Oh my God. I never thought I&#39;d see the day that I&#39;d feel jealous over Levi. This was new.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So no more contact?&#34; I pressed. I needed certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam shook his head, amused. I frowned at his expression. He signaled a waiter. Liam exuded arrogance and enviable confidence. He was as impervious as my husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wine was opened, the waiter filling two glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As soon as Levi informed me of your presence.&#34; He started, after the waiter left, handing me a glass. &#34;I couldn&#39;t wait to welcome the couple myself. Your news still buzzes the internet, you know. I&#39;m surprised the press outside didn&#39;t eat you alive. When word got out that we were repeating stripper&#39;s night in your honor, they flooded the premises.&#34; His tone was playful and I liked his smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was really easy to talk to and flirtatious. I lifted my glass and we toasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To new beginnings.&#34; He intoned. I nodded and sipped my drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t my husband supposed to be present for the toast?&#34; I asked, calmly. I wondered where Levi was. He was to answer a call, moments ago. I couldn&#39;t see him anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Liam shrugged, smiling slyly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So how do you find your experience here so far?&#34; He asked, intrigued. I looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s beautiful. I didn&#39;t even know what to expect. But I am impressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched me from a veiled expression. I couldn&#39;t really fathom his thoughts. Then his eyes shifted and I followed his gaze as he silently watched a couple of women, seated some distance. He looked lost as he stared at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright, Mr Liam&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please. Just Liam Is fine.&#34; He managed to say, tightly. I nodded, confused. Then a man in black two-piece suit, came to whisper in Liam&#39;s ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d have to excuse me. Some pressing matters have come up.&#34; He rose to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing the space between us, he whispered into my ear, his breath fanning me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a beautiful smile. Never lose it.&#34; I gasped at his words and the intimacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked away, I silently wondered if that guy might be K.C.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Levi.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Meanwhile***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat down and allowed the jolts of electricity settle in the man, before I spoke again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ask again. Who asked you to bring the girls?&#34; My tone was cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze hard. I was two seconds away from pulling his tongue out. The man whimpered as his body regained blood flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were in a room in the underground floor of Possess. This man was intercepted by Liam&#39;s men, about three weeks ago, smuggling a container of 300 girls into Miami from God knows where. I would have been here, weeks back, but I had pressing matters. So we just detained him, until my arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, another container was intercepted three nights back and this time, Liam lost a number of men in the shootout. So now we needed to interrogate this guy and find out their operations and their boss. Blake already had a team decoding his phone and laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has he talked yet?&#34; Liam spoke as he came to stand beside me. I shook my head. The room was cozy. Air conditioned. I didn&#39;t even have time to see past this ass hole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are we going to do with the girls? 600 of them, Levi,&#34; Liam said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was revolted by all this. These people kept trafficking girls, separating them from their families on the pretext of a better life in America. And in the end, some got killed. Used for very sadistic practices. I had witnessed such acts, years ago. And I vowed never to condone such.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and one of the men pulled the lever and the man screamed in agony. Jolts of electricity travelling through him. His entire body writhing. He was strapped to an electric chair and wires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We watched silently, the smell of burned flesh filling the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was over and the man could speak, he panted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;II will tell you everything.&#34; He gasped. I waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We work for BB He is a faceless person. We just get called and we arrange for the girls. We&#39;ve never met him. Even our contact with him doesn&#39;tDoesn&#39;t use his real voice.&#34; He whimpered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body trembling. I shared a glance with Liam, our brows raised. *BB?* I had heard of the name before. But we had never crossed paths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where can we find him?&#34; Liam asked, killing the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He finds you No one finds &#39;im.&#34; The man&#39;s eyes were weary from exhaustion and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew he was lying. Fury found me at the man&#39;s tenacity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed the space, pulling out my flick blade at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is just business friend.&#34; I pulled my knife, slicing the man&#39;s throat clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood gushing out.</p>
