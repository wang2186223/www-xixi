                <p>&#34;A certain Rowan, a former associate of CARSON Mines, is responsible for continuing the illicit transactions, under the name of CARSON Mines, despite your complete ownership of RINA Mines. Ploughing these communities, without compensation or proper procedure. And since CARSON was never really considered, it was never taken to account by us.&#34; Blake explained, his tone grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were documents that affirmed to discreet business dealings carried out in the name of CARSON Mines. A company, which I had inherited along with other companies and rebranded from RFO to RINA Mines. But I had no idea that these shady dealings had been carried out by my father in the past, causing the community conflicts that had caused the deaths of many. I shifted my eyes through the papers and my heart tore at the mortality caused by the deals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Falling back into my office chair, I spread the papers on my desk and glared at them. My eyes stung.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;*The sins of thy fathers.&#39; I* thought as I continued to observe the papers before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were list of names attached to all the affected countries. Names of men, women and children, catalogued in the papers. The names of their villages, clans, their dates of birth, their time of death. It was all written in black and white before my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I took liberties to look through the documents as soon as I discovered that your mother in-law&#39;s birth country was named. I think you would be interested to see what I found.&#34; Blake gravelly supplied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted a wary gaze to Blake, a sudden terror surging through me. I scrutinized the papers until I reached a sheet with Sierra Leone as the header. Perusing through the pages, my heart in my mouth, I came across a circled section of the names. Stilling at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Mr Willis Anderson*.&#34; I breathed, shakily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tremor gripped me, as my fears were confirmed. One which I had inwardly prayed against, the second Blake had raised my suspicions. My eyes lingered on the highlighted spot; scanning it, checking if there was any chance it could be a lie. But it wasn&#39;t. The name of my wife&#39;s father was aggressively glaring back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Fuck*!&#34; I roared, pushing back my chair, aggressively. I strode to the window. The rain pelting down the window, with the dark, gloomy sky mirroring my dismay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya can&#39;t find out about this.&#34; I shook my head, my back to Blake as I spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We aren&#39;t at a good point in our marriage at the moment. And the last thing we need is for her to find out that her father was one of the casualties of CARSON Mines.&#34; I placed my hand on the cold window. Absently watching the city line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry about that. But you must know that your marriage wouldn&#39;t be your only worry, the moment this gets further out.&#34; I heard Blake warn as he stood behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should know I am not worried about that. What concerns me is the horrid transactions that had been carried out using RFO as a cover. And now, am paying the fucking price, with my wife&#39;s heart hanging in the balance.&#34; I groaned inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened between you?&#34; Blake asked, his eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I huffed. &#34;At Saturday&#39;s party she wanted to know more about me, about our life, Blake and I was curt with her.&#34; A knowing look crossed Blake&#39;s eyes. &#34;Then Crawford came around and I got irritated at seeing him with her. Things got heated and she blew steam on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi.&#34; Blake started, quietly. &#34;She has a right to know about you. About who we are. About the life we lived. You can&#39;t deprive her of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that part isn&#39;t pleasant, Blake. It&#39;s not something I am proud of.&#34; I shook my head, my eyes shut tight. Flashes of memories I preferred buried resurfaced. The usual darkness creeping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give her a chance to choose, Levi. You haven&#39;t allowed her a chance to decide what she wants, since Hank. Since this marriage. Give her that much. She deserves it.&#34; Blake urged, his hand on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t have let her do otherwise, with Hank, Blake. I wasn&#39;t going to let that bastard hurt her further,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then tell her who you really are, Levi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised a thoughtful gaze to Blake, measuring his words. My chest constricted at the thought and I tried to breathe. The phone on the desk rang and interrupted the thick air. Blake went over to pick the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s finance, Levi.&#34; Blake dropped the receiver. &#34;They want to inform you that all funds and stocks directed to AUDACIOUS BRAND have been discontinued, as you directed. Further, they said all existing investors, that you had introduced to the company, have also been advised to do the same, immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, a small satisfaction stemming within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Write a public disclaimer against CARSON Mines as well as Rowan, and ensure it is followed up with a court injunction. Anything that would ensure that this is nipped in the bud.&#34; I instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The journalist informed me that he is open for negotiations, to put an end to this.&#34; Blake supplied. I stared at him, skeptically, even though relief washed over me. My brows knitted, as I considered this revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Call him and fix something with him for later tonight. I want this bullshit over and done with. And destroy every trace of these documents.&#34; I sternly ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake nodded his head, gathered all the documents from the desk and quietly exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Highlighting my laptop screen to attend to some work, I tried to push the misery that continued to linger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t ready for this. I had fought too hard to build my family&#39;s legacy from scratch and even adding mine. And an occurrence like this only evoked problems, which could pose a threat to all that I had built, including my recent marriage.</p>
