                <p>A crippled ballerina catches the eye of a dangerous senatorial candidate. When violence shatters her world, he offers protection at a brutal price: marriage. Now, she must navigate his lethal obsession and unearth his darkest secrets—before she loses herself to his emerald gaze forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Levi*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Manhattan, New York City.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Present day...*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat spellbound in the Ruthford family box, watching the show as the graceful dancers, leapt in the air, in synchrony to the music that filled the entire theater. I couldn&#39;t remember the last time I sat enraptured by a show. The entire theater, filled with golden lights was quiet, except for the music played by the orchestra on the stage. Everyone, it seemed was as entranced as I was, watching the dancers. But while they were all mesmerized by the lead dancer, I was captivated by the gracefulness and beauty of the ballerina, dancing at the rear end of the performers. Sure the lead dancer was extremely beautiful. Her skin flawless and her steps like a beautiful swan. But the dancer at the rear, she was a goddess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young beauty was an earth nymph. Her satin, sable skin, shiny, like the earth. Her limbs moved lightly, like a goddess of the night, pouring her dark hues on the earth. My gaze was fixed on her face, which radiated such beauty. Her lush lips, ripe and whispering to me to place soft, scintillating kisses on them. My eyes travelled down her long, graceful neck, all the way to her cut-low neck line and I imagined myself drinking from the nectar of her neck. I imagined licking down her throat to the bare top of her breasts. As my eyes lingered on her, I wished to peel off the white, little dress, which she had on. My groin tightened pleasurably in the pants of my black tux, a feeling I had not excitedly entertained for a long time. *A feeling that I had not felt, since Belle*. A great distaste threatened to climb up my throat, due to the unpleasantness attached to that name and I forcefully shoved the feeling aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thunderous claps that erupted from below, forced my thoughts back to the dancers, who were taking their bows in readiness to exit the stage. My eyes fixed on the same ballerina that had caught my attention. And I decided to send her a little gift. An appreciation for her exceeding performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake.&#34; I called to my manager from beside me, &#34;I want you to do something for me.&#34; I turned my gaze back to the ballerina, who was still waving to the audience, along with the other dancers. &#34;Find out about that ballerina at the rear.&#34; I made certain that Blake followed my eyes. &#34;The one at the rear to the right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Sir.&#34; Blake nodded, preparing to exit the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send her a bouquet of red roses from me, while you are at it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Sir...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As a matter of fact, once you are before her, call my number, so that I can speak with her.&#34; I added. Blake nodded his head and exited the box, while I sat back, to watch the dancers exit the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Kenya*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat before the mirror of my cubicle, in the backstage rooms and cleaned off my makeup. While I sat quietly, I listened to the talks of my colleagues. Everyone was in high spirits tonight, because the performance had turned out to be highly applauded by the anticipating audience. An audience, which had voted for this show on the online polls, when it was thrown out to them to choose, months ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but smile at my friend and colleague, Andrea, who was animatedly talking, some distance, to a couple of the male ballet dancers; Mike and Rory. I caught the look of affection in Mike&#39;s eyes as he watched Andrea. Both Mike and Andrea were in this enviable relationship, since three years, which to everyone&#39;s surprise was still waxing strong. I wished my relationship with Hank had even managed to span longer than 3 months before it ended, awfully. Sighing heavily, I put away m make up items and prepared to go change out of my costume. I was happy that the tickets for this act had sold out well, at least it was going to please the producers and everyone involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walked towards the clothes hanger to change out of my costume, someone called my name. I turned and responded loudly, only for me to be approached by the show&#39;s director, Billy and an unfamiliar man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Kenya, this here is Mr Blake Dickson. He is the manager to Senatorial aspirant, Levi Ruthford. A top patron of the theater.&#34; I turned a befuddled gaze to the man, who was holding a large bouquet of red roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice to meet you, Miss Anderson.&#34; Blake greeted, extending a palm to me, which I calmly took. Billy soon left us to go and attend to other matters, while I waited for the man before me to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These here are for you. I have been asked by Mr Levi Ruthford to give these to you.&#34; He handed me the roses, which I looked at with amazement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...You must be mistaken. I was not the lead ballerina in the show?&#34; I helplessly asked, as I accepted the flowers. I was confused. My mind mentally recalled the face of Levi Ruthford. Yep, I remembered him. The extremely sexy, handsome 35 year old owner of STA Constructions; running for New York Senatorial seat. But what was he doing sending me roses?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man let out a little smile as he brought out his phone and made a call. Then he handed the phone to me, as the phone was answered on the other end. I looked at him, perplexed, but accepted the phone at the nod of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H...Hello?&#34; I said, nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Kenya.&#34; I heard, quietly. A warm, rich voice, so raw and velvety that I felt a whoosh of air leave my lungs. I wondered at it, but controlled myself. A heady feeling, overwhelming me. There was a sudden excitement in me. Alien, but delightful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Levi Ruthford. I wanted to congratulate you, on a splendid performance.&#34;</p>
