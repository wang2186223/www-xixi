                <p>The clipped call ended abruptly. Nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened&#34; Albert asked, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to him. I didn&#39;t even know how to take it in. I didn&#39;t know what to say. I stared, horror struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The otherworldly voice on the call, hadn&#39;t sounded human. I thought about Kenya. My baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raking a shaky hand through my hair, I said. &#34;Someone just called, informing me that he has my wife.&#34; I watched Albert&#39;s face turn to steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I don&#39;t break the news of my withdrawal from the elections, before 12am on Seven Forty-five news, they&#39;ll kill her.&#34; I was frantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nerves twisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*How did they get her? Oh God!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My knees buckled, I sank to the concrete. I couldn&#39;t think. It was like my mind suddenly went blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even think twice about her sister&#39;s confession. Kenya was in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For seconds, I was disoriented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growling, pounding my fists into my thighs. I wanted the ground to swallow me whole, because I deserved it. I had taken the threat of this BB guy lightly. Now he had my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*My entire life; Kenya, our baby.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put yourself together man.&#34; Albert managed. &#34;Is there anyone you suspect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned. &#34;There&#39;s someone. But my team hasn&#39;t been able to decipher his codes, to crack his identity. It&#39;s likeIt&#39;s like a stone wall.&#34; My sins were haunting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elections didn&#39;t matter at the moment. What mattered was my wife and my unborn child. They were the only fragments of hope that still connected me to humanity. The only treasure I sought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenya was that ray of sunshine in my life. And our unborn child, was only an added bonus. Our completion. A little bit of us in one bundle of joy. A perfect gift package. Just like the one I had sent her in Baltimore, to congratulate her on the successful completion of her first movie role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had known all about her movements in Baltimore, because I had been there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You see, I owned the hotel she had put up in for those days. And had asked she be given an executive room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been in the room next to hers; watching her, seeing her sleep from the cctv footage. Just contented having her near me, despite the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she had phone sexed someone else, even though I had been the person, I had been hurt. Felt betrayed. I had followed Kenya all through, like a besotted fool, as she paraded herself with that Alec guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I had seen the footages of her with him; the peaceful expression she had in his presence, I had envied him. And had been relieved, when they stopped seeing each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had known she had fallen for him, even though she claimed otherwise. I had seen her adoration for him. Perhaps seeing him as a better version of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t minded been seen as a sick stalker, I had followed Kenya. Hopeful that she didn&#39;t break me like Belle had. Praying that somehow, her declaration of love for me was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then word reached me that Alec was seen heading to her room and all hell broke lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old pain, the betrayal I suffered from Belle. A demon I had tucked away, got unleashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been in the room next door, agonizingly watching my wife kissed by another man on the footage. Utterly ravished that I had turned to ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched it all, pain searing me into pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had sent them a complimentary drink, courtesy the hotel. Their wine glasses laced with heavy doses of sleeping pills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And by the time they had fallen asleep, I had asked my men to slip in and take them below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinded by my rage, I hadn&#39;t seen anything past her betrayal. A reminder of my reasons for never falling in love again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My entire fondness for her, my adulation, had been replaced by nothing but sheer hate. Anger scorching all I felt for her within me to crisp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment her tears had meant nothing. Her fears, her whimpers. All I had seen had been the exact pain Belle had caused me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart shredded, because I had already begun to realize that I felt a far stronger bond for Kenya, than I had for Belle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had become my every breath. My complete existence. And when the time came for me to hurt her, I had been reluctant. Feared to lose Kenya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had hesitated to take my pound of flesh from her.  And when she had announced our baby, I had taken the opportunity to save us. To give us one more chance. To give me one more chance to have her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now it hit me. I wasn&#39;t ready to let her go. I&#39;d never let her go. She was my light house in the middle of my dark storm. She was the one breath I always wanted to take. My world, wrapped in a sweet essence of joy and pure love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sank into the warmth that those words evoked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t lose herI can&#39;t lose her.&#34; I repeated continuously to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was the fear. Gone was my anger. This was me. Levi Ruthford, Kenya&#39;s husband, Father to our unborn child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her protector.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inhaling a shaky breath, I got up, letting my hard gaze fall on Albert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My initial panic replaced by something sinister. Taking root inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to get my wife back. But I need your help. Would you do this, for a brother?&#34; I sternly asked, ferociously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart thudded loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure. Anything for you, brother.&#34; Albert nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed back my pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I&#39;m not losing Kenya. Not now, not ever.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking out my phone, I called Blake. &#34;Blake, something&#39;s come up. He has my wife.&#34; My tone was dark. But my heart was darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My insides succumbing to the monsters that had once consumed me.</p>
