                <p>&#34;Well, if it isn&#39;t the latest P.A. How is work treating you, working for New York&#39;s most handsome CEO?&#34; Andrea teased, coming to swat Rory playfully in the arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He feigned hurt, chuckling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Ken.&#34; Rory smiled, coming to kiss me on the check. I admired his new look. He cleaned up nice, in a navy blue, three-piece suit and a silver tie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, you look handsome Rory. Am sure the ladies in Levi&#39;s office will be drooling.&#34; I playfully quipped. Rory smiled bashfully, pulling one of the seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Ken. My boss has me so distracted I barely have time for a break. He sent me here to give you this.&#34; He pulled out a sealed envelope from his jacket, handing it to me. &#34;That&#39;s the reason I am out here in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the cream colored envelope, with Levi&#39;s fleur-de-lis crest on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Rory, let&#39;s allow her privacy with her darling husband&#39;s mail.&#34; Andrea&#39;s tease broke my concentration as I tore open the envelope. Rory laughed, as he followed Andrea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Mike around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard Rory ask, as they left me alone in Andrea&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I unfolded the letter. Inhaling his scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;***Baby,***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Sorry that I had to send this. Something came up and I have to fly out on a business trip. I&#39;d be gone for a few hours. Would return as soon as I can. Rory would accompany you this evening to the movies.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***See you when I return. Take care of yourself.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Levi.&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared hopelessly at the letter. Disappointed. It was like he was deliberately frustrating my efforts to get closer to him since that night he aggressively took me. That night I danced for him. *Was I wasting my time? Was he never going to love me?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True, there had been a dark side to him, when he took me that night. An unrecognizable side that had frightened me. All his tenderness had evaporated. Replaced by a menacing Levi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of detesting and escaping him, my entire body had accepted him completely. My defenselessness against him was becoming a mild preoccupation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My desire replaced by love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I was in love with my husband.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow. That movie was great. I always wanted to watch it on cinema, but since I started my new job, haven&#39;t had the time. Ken, you okay?&#34; Rory nudged my elbow, jolting me. I stared blankly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s your mind. Don&#39;t tell me I wasn&#39;t good company. Your husband would flay me, if you complain,&#34; Rory teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We emerged the theater, entering the cool night air. I wanted to take a stroll around, but I was aware that Ryan would obstinately oppose. His new task was to ensure my safety at all cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting a gaze to Rory, I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we just go eat somewhere tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was 7pm, the streets alive. Luring me. Except for that note I had from Levi, there had been no other communication with him in six hours. His phone lines were out; even Blake&#39;s. I was worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory regarded me oddly, before he nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got in the car and the driver took us to a Mexican restaurant. I loved eating here with my friends, before I married. I was happy that Rory thought of it. We had both changed into casuals for the evening, so we didn&#39;t look bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were enthusiastically greeted by Javier, the owner. In no time, he got us a free table, our dishes on the way. I felt like having something spicy. So I chose the spicy and crispy chicken tamales, laced with jalapenos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Kenya. I can&#39;t help but congratulate you on your recent nuptials.&#34; Javier beamed, as the waiter arrived with our orders. I smiled, feeling awful about my initial reaction to the wedding thing. Now I wished things could have been different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, Javier.&#34; I picked up a tamale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had thought you and Rory would eventually become an item. Who would have suspected you had that handsome politician in your grasp?&#34;Javier teased, his words stunning me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was confused. Shifting an embarrassed gaze to Rory, who held mine, before he nervously averted his. I grew puzzled. Rory and I had only been friends, nothing more. But the look in Rory&#39;s eyes silenced me from correcting Javier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Javier left, I looked up at Rory, who ate his tacos in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder why Javier thought that. We&#39;re just friends.&#34; I wanted to ease the tensed atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory&#39;s gaze was soft. &#34;It&#39;s funny how clueless you can get, Ken.&#34; He smiled. I frowned, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I asked. I didn&#39;t understand his expression, but I saw his hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have been in love with you since you first joined Byron&#39;s dance company. How couldn&#39;t you see it?&#34; Rory ruefully declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared, speechless. My mind struggling to assimilate his words, which felt alien.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s not possible. How could that be? You only saw me as a friend.&#34; I argued, my fists clenched tight beneath the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe his words, because the only look I had ever seen from him had been casual. Loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you thinking I hung out with you all, because I enjoyed being in the midst of a beautiful girl like you, no feelings attached?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dangled those words. I shook my head, trying to make rational of his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if you did, I would have known. I would have guessed it.&#34; I tried to protest. But Rory shook his head in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were too caught up with self-condemnation that you couldn&#39;t even see true love if it hit you like lightening. Just like you can&#39;t see Levi&#39;s feelings for you.&#34; Rory accused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; I asked, angry. Bewildered. Rory guardedly watched me. Inhaling a steady breath, he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I eavesdropped on you and Andy&#39;s conversation earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared, astonished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi doesn&#39;t just see you as his priority. He sees only you.&#34;</p>
