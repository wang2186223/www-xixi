                <p>***Levi.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Present day, the next day***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wednesday. I found myself struggling to drown out Kenya&#39;s disappointed voice, when she asked me if this trip couldn&#39;t wait until morning, but I couldn&#39;t. She was everywhere in my head. And I currently needed my head to function.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was deep in a forest in Colombia, hiking to one of my plantations. Our car was parked at the other side, so we wouldn&#39;t wake the locals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was 4 am and still dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake panted beside me. His athletic frame, allowing him to equally catch up. I recalled when we were younger and how he used to struggle to catch up with my strides, because he was small at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve grown up nice.&#34; I teased, pausing to drink some water from my canister. I could feel his hard glare at me and I chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are only older by one year, Levi. Don&#39;t push it.&#34; His tone was playful, even as he panted for air. I shook my head, offering him some water. His canister held coffee, laced with brandy for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We trudged on and soon arrived the plantation. What I saw gripped me. The entire plantation was smoking from the flames of the fire that engulfed it, a day ago. I stood horrorstruck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millions worth of coca plants burnt to the ground. Some survived, as we walked through the devastation. But it was no use. The soil was going to need recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Workers still tried to salvage what they could. And I tried to remain calm. Even though I was aware that I still had other plantations, it still hurt knowing this was lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a major supplier of the plant to pharmaceutical companies. And my clientele ranged far. This was a setback for me in the Colombia region.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was taken to the local infirmary, where some of the workers that had suffered burns were admitted. There were twenty workers, whose burns were very severe. Others had minor burns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is responsible for this?&#34; I asked, looking at Rico, who finally came to join us. His hands were wrapped in bandages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why aren&#39;t you in the infirmary?&#34; I asked him, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Work must go on boss.&#34; He spoke. I nodded, unable to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I talked to the doctors, and made calls and arrangements for the people to be taken to the hospital in Bogota for better treatment. They were very grateful and I even promised continuity of their jobs, once they recovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without any further delay, I joined the available workers and some of my men, and we started clearing the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I heard gunshots in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first I attributed it to the local watch team, who perhaps were scaring off rebels. I paid them to ensure the safety of the everyone. Hence I was surprised that this devastation had occurred under their watch. The fire looked like a very ordinary accident. But to the critical eye, a fire of such magnitude wasn&#39;t accidental.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the shots came again. This time more persistent and closer. I stilled and so did the rest of us. Blake came to stand beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hear that.&#34; He muttered. I nodded. Then someone in the distance shouted in the local dialect and the entire place broke into a panic. I looked around and saw the women and children running for cover, while the men pulled out guns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rico came running, pulling out a gun. My men equally pulled theirs, handing me an Ak47.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, some masked people are coming! They&#39;ve shot some people along the way!&#34; Rico yelled as he approached. Before I could say a word, a shot was fired and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rico fell dead to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran for cover among the plants. Crawling in the dirt. Blake came up beside me, matching my moves. We crawled to a couple of trees and hid as the shots continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smoke covered everywhere and the darkness didn&#39;t help. I fired some blind shots and the shots grew more persistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Screams were heard and I banished the sounds; thinking of my survival. Blake fired as well and my men came around, covering me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then a loud voice called me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi Ruthford!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stilled. My gun poised. My finger set on the trigger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel my breath coming in rapid puffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come out now, or this woman gets her head blown off!&#34; The voice thundered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, peeking around the tree to have a look. Light from a jeep illuminated a man surrounded by approximately ten men. A man had a gun pointed to a woman&#39;s head, while she knelt on the floor. I stared frantically. Considering my options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got ten minutes to come up here, or her brain gets blown off! One!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LeviDon&#39;t,&#34; Blake said beside me. I spared him a look. If I didn&#39;t, that woman was going to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake, if I don&#39;t, that woman dies. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised those men were responsible for this devastation,&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Levi&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No argument.&#34; I quieted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three!&#34; The voice boomed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; I called, coming out. I shook inside from rage, stepping out from behind the tree. I approached them, my hands raised above my head, my gun limp in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men were masked, dressed in combat garb. But I knew they weren&#39;t military. When I reached them, I dropped my gun. One of them came around to frisk me. I stayed, watching them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you the men that destroyed my plantation?&#34; I asked, fiercely. A man, who I presumed was the leader, stepped forward and punched</p>
                
                
                
                <p>me in the gut. I buckled, winded from the impact. He raised my head roughly and stared into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not the boss here. I am, Levi Ruthford.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all laughed, sinisterly. I panted, gathering my strength. I couldn&#39;t recall the last time I was in this sort of situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for the first time in years, I was terrified.</p>
