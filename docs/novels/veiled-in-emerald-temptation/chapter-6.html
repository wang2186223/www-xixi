                <p>I watched her coolly, before I replied, &#34;Since a day after that night I spoke to you.&#34; Kenya stared at me, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had my address since then and you never pressed after I refused dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I even had your phone number. Both your cell and home number.&#34; I nodded. She seemed to wonder at my words, from her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why hadn&#39;t you...?&#34; She paused. I studied her. My gaze lazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pursued you further?&#34; I finished for her, my brow raised in amusement. Kenya nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I don&#39;t know...&#34; I trailed off, shaking my head. Lost in my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A comfortable silence, ensued between us, as our gazes remained on each other. I found this weird- the stream of unidentifiable feelings flowing through me. I couldn&#39;t help it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a cue from her, I cleared my throat to speak. &#34;I should let you finish your dinner.&#34; I flicked a gaze to her unfinished dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting, I made way to the door, when Kenya&#39;s voice stalled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry that I refused that dinner in May.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned slowly to face her, in that instant, as she continued. Closing the distance between us. &#34;I was healing from a horrible breakup with my ex-boyfriend at the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was that the reason you had tears in your eyes when you opened the door, earlier?&#34; I asked, bluntly. A frown climbing my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were a step away from each other. Kenya held her breath, perhaps surprised I guessed her situation and had been silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can trust me, Kenya. Is he troubling you?&#34; I asked, suddenly growing concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope I was much of a distraction to you, Mr Ruthford, especially considering how tumultuous things currently are with your electoral campaign.&#34; She diverted the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at her subject change and decided she wasn&#39;t ready to talk yet. I would know eventually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have been a great distraction, Miss Anderson.&#34; I smiled. &#34;Considering all that has happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are a true politician, Mr Ruthford.&#34; She smiled wryly, shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How so?&#34; I asked, puzzled, a smile tugging my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First you said I was beautiful, the other night. Now you claim I have been a great distraction. No wonder the entire City...the women. Everyone is abuzz with news of you. You wield your words perfectly, like a knife. Spinning a web of lies around your prey.&#34; She smiled genuinely. I was astonished at her words and broke into a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally catching my breath, I responded, &#34;I wish that were the case, Kenya. But sadly, it isn&#39;t. If it were to be, the women of New York wouldn&#39;t have raised those concerns about me tonight, during the exclusive.&#34; A chuckle escaped me. One which tethered more on amusement than bitterness at my situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few hours ago, when I had heard the statement on the Television, I had been furious. Wondering when the criteria for being a senator had included having &#39;a functioning family,&#39; as the women&#39;s representatives had declared during the exclusive. But now, discussing with this woman, I didn&#39;t feel as embittered as I had before. My heart felt, relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do not need to fill the people&#39;s heads with a web of lies, Mr Ruthford. All they need from you is your truth. Just be you with them,&#34; she said, quietly, her eyes watching me, intensely. I stared at her keenly. &#34;Let them know the real Levi Ruthford and not the one that is presented on the media.&#34; She added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Transparency,&#34; I echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Transparency.&#34; She nodded her head. I smiled at her, thoughtfully. She wasn&#39;t just a beauty. She was intelligent. A strategist. She was right. I needed to be transparent with the people. I needed them to know the real Levi Ruthford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking myself, I nodded in acquiescence. &#34;Alright. I&#39;d consider your words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then regretfully, I added. &#34;I&#39;d take my leave now.&#34; I smiled and inclined my head as I turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She edged towards the door, as I opened it. Didn&#39;t she want this moment to end, like I didn&#39;t want it to? Clutching tightly to the door, she watched me. I turned around to face her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You alluded to me spinning a web of lies around my prey. Pray tell, Kenya, have you become a prey that has fallen into my web?&#34; I asked, curious. Drawing closer to her, so close that I could feel her heart. So much so that her breath fanned me. She was inches shorter than I was. Petit and delectable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenya gazed up at me and I saw something inside her eyes, which both frightened and intrigued me, all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night, Miss Anderson.&#34; I managed to whisper. Then in a flash, I was out of her sight, walking down the corridor of her apartment building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to look back, because I was afraid of the raw need I felt, being in her presence. I hadn&#39;t felt like this in a long time. I don&#39;t think I had ever felt this way. Even with Belle. This was raw. Primal. A need that bordered within deep walls. And I was terrified of exploring it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***A Week Later.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed at the stack of different designs of campaign posters on my office desk, awaiting my approval. I felt completely overwhelmed. This entire campaign was eating into me and my business. And I never toyed with my business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For almost three years, since I showed interest in running for New York Senatorial elections, my life had become less private. The outfits I put on, foods I ate and the places I ate them. God forbid even the way I wiped my arse. My life had become so invaded that sometimes I wished to drop the whole thing. Let Harley Crompton take it. But I was never one to back down from a competition. The reason for my success after dad wrecked us, years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That memory brought an acrid taste to my mouth. Anger flaring.</p>
