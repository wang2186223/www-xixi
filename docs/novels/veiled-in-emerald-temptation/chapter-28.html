                <p>***Kenya***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, those words made me less confused. Even the apprehension that suddenly surfaced, dissipated. I nodded my head in understanding and let myself relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had never gone this far with any man before. I had been kissed twice by boys in high school. Actually, on both occasions, they had asked me to pay them, so they could kiss me. I never asked for a kiss in high school again. *I just remembered that. Wow! The doctor was right.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising one of my legs, Levi positioned himself before my wet entrance. I trusted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He guided his fingers into my wet entrance, toying subtly with my delicate pearl, until I cringed and moaned again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kissing me softly, he guided himself slowly and painfully, through my pliant entrance. I whimpered as my sheath, tight, warm and so soft, stretched. Pain searing through. But I continued to trust him, because I knew he had me. I was safe. And when he reached my barrier he intensified the kiss, distracting my pain with his fingers on my pearl again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pleasure from those fingers, I felt him deftly thrust. Fully buried to the hilt within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I screamed, but it was swallowed in Levi&#39;s kiss. My whimpers muffled in his breath. My eyes were clutched tight from the agony I felt being invaded whole for the first time. And my body trembled. He had tactfully held my hands above my head, knowing that I was going to struggle, once he went in. And only now that he was fully inside me did he release me to find my pearl again. I shook beneath Levi, tears rolling down the sides of my face. Even as he continued to hold on to the kiss. All the strength in me to fight was gone. All pleasure drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding my pearl again with his fingers, Levi began quiet strokes, and soon I began to relax again. My hips rocked to the rhythm of his fingers. I had seen his cock earlier, and I had wondered how all that was to enter me. Large, full and beautiful. Now it was buried in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly remembered his vow at the wedding and I wondered if this was what he meant, that I would never lack even his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He resumed moving himself within me with his cock. Mimicking the strokes of his fingers. Thrusting. Stretching me fully and at the same time, rolling inside me. I rocked my hips, dancing in rhythm to his moves, innocuously. And soon, something unbidden, that threatened to rock me whole, mounted within me. I panted softly, moaning as the swirls of ecstasy climbed me. I was engulfed whole. He was my pleasure. This was everything in one; sweet, painful all at once. And I couldn&#39;t find the sense to stop. I didn&#39;t want to stop. I was surrendering. Wishing this never ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi kissed me some more and continued to thrust himself at a slow pace within me, knowing that my body was still getting used to him. He was completely gentle. Patient as he led me on. Even when I knew that it was my first time. I was moving my hips to his rhythmic pace. Pleasure mounted within me. Threatening to burst through me any minute. I felt myself reaching the point I had reached when he sucked me. Clenched his tongue to my pearl. And pleasure soared inside me. Levi played this out longer and slowed his strokes some more. I was ready to touch the top, and he increased his strokes and added his fingers. Circles and strokes and circles. Not leaving any stone unattended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi...Levi...I can&#39;t hold on...I want to...I want...&#34; I cried repeatedly, uncertain of my needs. Kissing him deeply, my cry a plea to him, Levi leaned into her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come for me, Baby. Just surrender...&#34; He breathed. He groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gasps came rapidly now. His breathing uneven. And without a second thought, I found my release and allowed myself to unwind around my husband. My cry of release earning him a release of his own. Drawing a guttural cry of satisfaction from his lips, my name, a sweet plea on his lips as he spilled within me. His cock throbbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We clung together like that, after we were spent. Sheen of sweat on our bodies. Levi sprawled on top of me, as we relished in the moment. His skin, soft and manly. Warm and sweet. Pulling himself slowly out of me, he lay on his back on the bed and hauled me closer to him. Exhaustion washed over us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you learn French?&#34; Levi asked, after our breathing had evened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inhaling softly, I replied, &#34;French was one of my favorite subjects in high school. And when we reached Manhattan school of the arts, we were all asked to add a foreign language to our classes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You remembered that part of you.&#34; Levi observed, smiling above my head. I shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more question. How did you remain a virgin until tonight?&#34; I wondered if he had been curious to know since he first discovered this part of me. But there hadn&#39;t been any chance for us to be alone. And now, it just felt right to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My virginity had been my only asset, I guess. Something that I had come to treasure, considering my limp and how others saw me.&#34; I smiled. I was remembering some things. That was something. The doctor had assured us of my gradual recovery a week back when we had spoken over the phone. At least this was something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You remember this part of you,&#34; he said, triumphantly. I had been so sad when I had struggled to recall certain bits of me after the incident. And now, I was at rest, knowing that I would fully recover someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a memory thing.&#34; I shrugged again. &#34;Some things are just ingrained in you, from the day life gets exposed to you.&#34; I smiled again.</p>
