                <p>***September 15th, eight years earlier***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By August 15th, three months later, I married Belle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you were a socialite and hadn&#39;t attended the wedding, you were snobbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire wedding turned out a success and the bride, received the best set of diamonds as a wedding band, mined by my company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, in addition to construction, I discreetly owned and ran the mining company, which I inherited from my family. Rebranded to RINA mines, in honor of my parents, we legally mined diamonds, and other precious minerals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been the happiest groom. Marrying a girl from a top socialite family. Additionally, a girl I had fallen for. While her parents had been the most elated; their daughter marrying New York&#39;s best. Her twin on the other hand had regarded me with scorn and suspicion, the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I could only see Belle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t seen her lips pulled into a tight line. Or her neck taut from her forced smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, everyone wondered why I hadn&#39;t taken it slow, and I usually wondered the same. But who determined these things. Cupid&#39;s arrow struck, you obliged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, two years later, I was wondering why I hadn&#39;t noticed the red flags. Or I had, but only cast it as the whims of a superficial, young, beautiful woman. A woman, who was used to men falling at her feet, with her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>10pm and I was sitting to dinner at the Ruthford mansion, waiting for my dear wife of two years to return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our Anniversary was tonight and I had made ample preparations to show my love still burned after two years. I wanted to show her all the passion my words sometimes couldn&#39;t say. Life had turned me into a taciturn guy. As a result, I allowed my actions speak my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her favorite food prepared. A stunning diamond set worth hundreds of dollars for her. Yet she was absent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew where she was. I was no fool. Had her every move followed by my men. However, I wanted to believe I was married to a pious woman. Even though the evidence that presently lay exposed on the table said differently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had just finished watching another footage of my wife having sex with multiple partners. Five this time. A higher number to the three she had been having for the past two years since we married. Yes, Belle Ruthford, started cheating on me, from the moment we got married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even at the wedding reception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time she had excused herself to go powder her nose or something. When she returned, she had reeked of sex and I had almost choked. But somehow a kiss from her beautiful lips, which now I remember, had smelled foul, thawed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, I hadn&#39;t seen the footage sent by my men, until after the entire ceremony the following morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you coming from?&#34; I asked Belle, as she walked by, smelling of bullshit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She managed to clean up nice, considering the life footage I had just watched of her. She was startled by me; by the entire arrangement of the table. My gaze, hardened, remained on her the entire time. My vision blurred with men fucking every orifice she had, moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I said I had men watching her every move, I meant 24/7.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the fuck are you coming from, Belle?!&#34; I roared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jerked in fright, knowing that she had never seen my rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had always shown her tenderness, leniency. Even when her parents had died a year ago, and she had chosen to stay away from me for six months, I hadn&#39;t argued. I had allowed her. Even though I later knew her whereabouts for those six monts. She had been in our property in Milan, indulging in sick debauchery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, my patience was done; replaced by a seething revulsion and hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inching closer to her, I held the tablet to her face and let her see her own sin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight I was her judgement, and she was my worst mistake. Belle&#39;s skin turned pale, as she currently watched the video. Her moans in the video sickening to my stomach. Petrified, she was unable to look me in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know what they call me in the underworld.&#34; My tone wasn&#39;t supposed to be menacing, but I had drained all capability of humanity at this point. I was void of emotion but hate. &#34;Am the King of New York My love. I have you all here.&#34; I showed her my palm, for emphasis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trembled now, her eyes pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;sit&#39;s-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save it, Belle. I saw you from the first time you did it on our wedding day. I know you.&#34; I cut her off. She gasped, frightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up my phone, raising it to my ear. &#34;Come inside. Have the entire estate locked, until this is over.&#34; I put the phone away, returning to my seat. Anger simmering inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t even look at her. This same woman, who I had given my world, my time. I had bought her a property in Milan as her wedding gift and she had gone to pay me this way. Well the Milan property was sold now. She didn&#39;t need to find that out. Where she was going, there&#39;d be only her eternal judgement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LeviI&#39;m sorry. ItIt wasn&#39;t my intentionI lo&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut her a look and whatever she had wanted to say, was swallowed back. The moment was interrupted by the door opening and my men filing in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and gasped. Her latest five lovers being dragged into our presence. They were struggling, infuriating me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;BelleWhat is this?&#34; One of them asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned at his audacity. A familiar model. She didn&#39;t even have any taste. Fucked boy toys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To answer his question. I walked to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This, my friend, is the beginning of your end.&#34; I swept a gaze across them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My guilty captives. Their executioner.</p>
