                <p>I finally woke up, my arms aching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ropes wound tight around me. Digging into my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked, I saw I was in undies, again. But this time, I was sitting upright. Strapped with electrical wires. My mouth gagged, throat parched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been trying to pry them open. Frankly with my current situation, I&#39;d have preferred them closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I assessed my surroundings. An office. A car sales office, perhaps. My brain, confused. I could hear heavy machinery somewhere, but I wasn&#39;t certain. All anger at my sister and Levi, disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Replaced with fear for I and the baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office was as spacious as a warehouse; one door. A dusty concrete floor. I wondered the last time they cleaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desks scattered with papers, stood at a far corner. A board, with some weird drawings. *A shipping company, perhaps?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to suspect Levi as my abductor, but this was too tacky for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d give it to him; the man had taste, even with his style of depravity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored my panties as it dug into my arse. I was alone in God knows where. My baby and I in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I recalled everything. Amanda&#39;s confession. My astonishment at it. I hadn&#39;t even waited to listen to the rest. The moment she referred to the tattoo, she had won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I had reached the car, I cried. My only thoughts that just once, something Amanda could have left for me. Yet she hadn&#39;t. He had to taste her first before me. So I was second best again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinded by jealousy, my inferiority complex, rage, I had asked Steve to take me home. Wanting to drown myself in anguish. Let the aches of sadness devour me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were in one of the black SUV&#39;s and it was already dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when Steve alerted me to a couple of cars following us. I thought he had been mistaking, but when I looked back, I saw them. Their lights glared at us, as we crossed under a bridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the moment another car intercepted us in front, causing Steve to pull hard on the brakes. I screamed in fright at the suddenness. My heart in my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four men rushed out from the car in front, pointing guns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, we climbed out, kneeling on the floor, as they asked. Without a single hesitation, they shot Steve in the head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scream instantly escaped me, seeing the man drop dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But someone covered my mouth with a cloth, hushing me. The cloth smelled awful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feared for my life, for my baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blacked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So no, this wasn&#39;t Levi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was anxious now. If they had killed Steve so brutally, then they wouldn&#39;t spare me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried hard, staring up at the clock. 10:15pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door flew open, jolting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men filed in, all wearing black ski masks. Ten men. My eyes opened in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had these guns that I was sure could drill holes in a ship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked to the door again, a tall familiar figure came inside. The man with the Unseelie mask at the party, who had caused us to drift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recalled his threats from that night and I suddenly grew alarmed. I was really in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome, Mrs Ruthford. We meet again.&#34; He was close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone brought a chair. He sat. The mask still frightened me, but now, he frightened me more. He placed a gun in his laps. Perhaps reminding me that he was in control. I couldn&#39;t even argue. He had me at a deadlock here. All gagged, bound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I warned your husband, but he didn&#39;t listen.&#34; His said sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shaky. Frightened. Worse, I was wearing only undies. I felt completely vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The problem is your husband never takes me seriously. Never has. I was always shoved aside, never seen. For years, I followed in his wake, adoring his style, his charisma. The way he handled tasks. Never one day did he take me under his wing. Rather, always saw me as Pip Squeak. The name they all called me, because I was so small.&#34; He supplied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. *Small*? He didn&#39;t look small. Rather had this kickboxing-golf playing-guy built. He looked at me with a knowing smile. Like he read my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I know; I look wonderful now. Years of good food and professional dietary plans.&#34; He grew thoughtful. His eyes raking me. &#34;Aside from your limp, you&#39;re a very desirable woman, you know. I&#39;d have loved to take you, here and now. Perhaps share you with my men, after I&#39;m done. But a deal is a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes opened wide. I whimpered. *God I was in trouble*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried that I was pregnant. Unfortunately, my words came out like this,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MmmMmmMmmMmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed, sinisterly. His expression obscured by the mask. &#34;Am sorry sweet heart, I can&#39;t hear you. But have no fear. I&#39;ve got a deal with your husband. I had him called earlier. If he can give a press release concerning his withdrawal from the elections, you&#39;ll be walking out of this junkyard alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shuddered inwardly. Hit by those words. My eyes blurry with tears. The man&#39;s tone cold. I could only see the ruthlessness of a killer. I couldn&#39;t see any humanity. He had given Levi a difficult ultimatum. To choose between career and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly I grew sad for Levi. Withdrawing from elections that he had worked hard for. Gaining the confidence of the people, despite his past. That would be awful. It was damn cruel for this man to use Levi&#39;s world to crush him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sinking in despair, knowing Levi had no care for me and so wouldn&#39;t have to save me. Only hatred existed. I could die tomorrow and he&#39;d move on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung my head in grief, weeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard their sick laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door flew open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The laughers stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get your face off my wife, Crompton.&#34;</p>
