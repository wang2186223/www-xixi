                <p>I struggled to open my eyes, but they seemed to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some difficulty, I pried them open. My eyelids heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood rang in my ears as I tried to focus my mind. My shoulders ached, growing numb. I felt tugged at every side. My muscles ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was naked, except for my undies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at my hands, I discovered that my limbs were bound. I was spread across a bed. I tugged my hands and the clanking sounds of chains, came. I panicked. Confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked around, taking in my surroundings, my eyes fell on Levi, sitting on a seat across from my feet. His cold gaze on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi&#34; I muttered, hazily. *Was I dreaming?* &#34;What are you doing in Baltimore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t flinch. His hard gaze lingered. His face, expressionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I own this hotel. Hi Baby. Miss me?&#34; He grinned, darkly. A chill passed through me at his menacing look. His words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was weird. I heard him, but I felt groggy. Dizzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled with the chains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;WhyWhy am I chained?&#34; I asked, incoherently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Why was I sleepy? Where was Alec? I needed to getI needed to talk to Levi.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind, wild with thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re chained up, because this is your nightmare come to life.&#34; Levi seethed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Why is he angry? I need to talk to you, Levi.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LeviWe needWe need to talkWhy am I dizzy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes grew colder, if it could be possible. Then he barked, his eyes still on me. &#34;You can come in now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi was dressed in all black. Black long sleeved shirt, waist coat and slacks. His top buttons on his shirt off and the sleeves rolled up. There was a ferocity in his gaze that I had never seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some men dressed in lab coats, filed into the room, bearing carts. They began setting up equipments, alarming me. Someone pushed a needle into me. I flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually, I regained my senses. Seeing everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An IV was in my vein.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still trying to understand, when Alec was rolled into the room. My senses more alert now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alec&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He can&#39;t hear you. Flush him.&#34; I heard Levi say, addressing one of the men in lab coats. An IV line was set up and he was infused, like I currently was. As the fluid travelled through me, I grew more aware.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you doing this, Levi?&#34; I asked. I was still weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*God, this could hurt us! I had no idea what they had put inside me earlier*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know? What were you thinking, that I&#39;d just let you have your way? Fuck every man until you got your satisfaction. Got rid of me. Like you threatened.&#34; He was angry, sitting there, watching me from lidded eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I panicked, realization hitting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NoII didn&#39;t fuck anyone.&#34; I protested. The last I remembered, I was lying in bed with Alec, telling him about me and Levi. Somehow, we fell asleep. His arms around me. I didn&#39;t fuck him. Perhaps the kiss. Nothing else. Guilt swamped me as I recalled the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We didn&#39;t have sexWe just kissed&#34; I said, anxiously. Levi&#39;s gaze grew cold. I started at the look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec woke up then. &#34;Where Where am I? Kenya?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi frowned, rising from his seat. He walked to Alec and the look on Alec&#39;s face alarmed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LeviIt&#39;s not what you think&#34; Alec said, hysterically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AlecYou know him?&#34; I asked, stunned. Alec nodded frantically. His legs, arms were bound tight. Dread filled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HeHe&#39;s one of my father&#39;s clientsThat was the reason I didn&#39;t want to kiss you that day&#34; Alec confessed. Humiliation stung me, as those words filled the entire room. Levi turned to me. A dark scowl, marring his handsome face. His eyes a darker shade of green.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how pathetic that sounded now? *You*, whom I have treated as a Queen, asked a man for a kiss&#34; Levi&#39;s voice was thick with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears wet my eyes, at his declaration. I could barely feel my arms, but I felt the pain in his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not like that&#34; My voice was low. I wanted to reach out to him. Hold him. Tell him the reason I had done it all that. I wanted us to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you, KenyaHow could you!&#34; Levi roared, crashing my entire world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t turn away from his rage. I could only shut my eyes to his fury. His rage tore down the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi I am sorry&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry? Sorry?&#34; He called, sarcastically. &#34;You know why I never answered you, when you confessed your love to me? It was because of this.&#34; His voice held scorn. And I was suddenly afraid to hear the next words he had to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because love hurt me before. Dad. Mum. And then Belle. Because love makes us lose control.&#34; His eyes were fully on me. He walked closer, looming over the bed. He sat below my feet on the bed. His tone dropped low, sinister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because when you love a woman, she ruins you. Leaves you for her own desires.&#34; His tone was detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew closer, until our eyes levelled on each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wanted to know what happened to Belle. This is what I did to Belle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t see Levi anymore. He was replaced by a dark being I didn&#39;t recognize. His voice was detached, his eyes cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no emotion there. Only pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did the same thing she did. So it&#39;s only logical I do the same to you,&#34; he said. I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*God I was in pain. My arms.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what she did... But I didn&#39;t do the same. I have been true to you. IAlec was a different matter. I didn&#39;t do anything to hurt you.&#34; I cried now. Tears rolling down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t, but you did. K.C, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him confused. Then a knowing look crossed his face, realization hitting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Oh God, no!*</p>
