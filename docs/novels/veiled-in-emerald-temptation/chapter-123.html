                <p>I just finished shooting my last scene with the crew, while the rest will continue. I was suddenly exhausted. Like I had run a marathon. I hated running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sank into the chair in my cabin, reaching for a bottle of water. God I could smell the chlorine in it. It was high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock came and I asked the person in. Alan approached, bearing a basket of gifts, along with a large bouquet of deep red roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi Kenya.&#34; He greeted, kissing me on the cheek. When he pulled away, he raised the gifts to my eye level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I come bearing gifts, Your Majesty.&#34; He was playful. I liked playful Alan. His eyes grew concerned, when he saw my face. &#34;Something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scrunched up my nose, trying to erase the taste of the chlorine. &#34;I don&#39;t know. I think this water has too much chlorine.&#34; I complained. He frowned, grabbing the bottle, tasting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It tastes just fine to me,&#34; Alan said, dropping the water. I eyed the water, dubiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, when are you leaving. Filming is over for you. I think we have another contract for you. This time as a more prominent support actress. We&#39;d send you the details once we&#39;re ready.&#34; He put down the gifts. I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anytime you&#39;re ready, Alan. I am happy to work with you in the movie projects.&#34; I informed him. Then my eyes returned to the gifts. &#34;Who are these from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged. &#34;A delivery man dropped them off with my assistant. You want me to confirm for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, rising to leave instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are you leaving?&#34; Alan asked. A sadness threatened to buckle me. I was aware that I couldn&#39;t live here forever. I had a duty to uphold as a wife to a public figure. I had to also take care of my responsibilities as a business woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts went to Alec and his silence towards me since that day. It hurt that I had allowed my emotions becloud me. But my current feelings didn&#39;t prevent me from enjoying the city longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps in three days. I love the city already. The history and everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alan wanted to say something, but he shut his mouth again. &#34;I would send you a copy of the monthly report for the board members in your email, later. Safe travels.&#34; Alan smiled, leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire thought of returning to my life as Levi&#39;s wife was depressing. Making me nauseous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I reached for the bathroom, puking. For seconds, it continued and I didn&#39;t have the strength to move out of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was able to, I gathered my things and the gifts and got into the waiting cab. Instead of going to my hotel, I asked the driver to head for the nearest hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed a doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was absently staring at the gifts as they rested on the coffee table in my hotel suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything felt alien, as I ran through the conversation with the doctor, hours ago. I was wearing a navy blue, silk nighty, sitting on the bed. My feet on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down my eyes and I didn&#39;t clean them. My phone rang beside me and I didn&#39;t answer. There was a talk show on TV about celebrity marriages and how they manage the fame and their relationship. And a photo of Levi and I flashed as one of the couples that managed their lives well. But I didn&#39;t listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A more pressing matter bothered me. The telephone in the suite rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, a knock came, jolting me. Pulling my robe, I opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec stood in front of me in navy blue scrubs. Shocking. Hadn&#39;t seen him in days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I come in?&#34; He asked. I nodded, letting him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he entered, he briefly took in the room, before he turned to me. We locked gazes and I could see he had something on his mind. Well, so did I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am sorry about that day.&#34; He started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Oh, if I had a dollar every time I heard that.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I chickened out. I was scared of my father&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I get it. Your father controls your life and you didn&#39;t want to kiss a pathetic married woman&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nono Kenya.&#34; He rushed to me, holding my shoulders. His eyes intense. Pain and tension in the depth of his gaze. &#34;Let me show you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, Alec kissed me. Soft, tentative. I moaned, drinking in his coffee laced mouth. He pressed closer, slipping his fingers inside my robe, kneading my breast. Pinching one nipple. A deep rumble escaped his throat as he touched my nipple. I moaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backing us against the bed, until he lay us on it. He took off my robe, slipped down my nighty. Hungry eyes assessed my body, before he pressed me to the mattress. Sexy, a great kisser. I was turned on. And my hormones and my body. He played drums on my body, as he sucked one of my nipples, pinching the other one. I felt sore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was wet. Exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t. Shouldn&#39;t. Not now. Not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Levi was my darkness, my agony, he was forever a part of me now. Someone I couldn&#39;t get rid of, no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was now my truth. A mix of fair and dark. Hate and Love. He was my wrong and my right. And I couldn&#39;t erase him anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We needed to work things out for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But first, I had to take care of Alec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wish we had time. I wish he had come a few months back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled away, staring at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we just sleep in instead. Hold me, while I talk. Because if I don&#39;t get this out of my system, I might implode.&#34; I wept. He held my gaze. His lips kiss swollen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, I began talking and Alec listened.</p>
