                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec and I crossed the street, in silence, heading to a restaurant nearby. It was 8pm, I didn&#39;t drive tonight. Ryan and my driver had seen me cross the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Alec ordered wine. I didn&#39;t drink mine. He asked to talk and that&#39;s what I was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After his second gulp I think he relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father has always been an asshole.&#34; Alec started, dragging my eyes from a family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wife was wiping the girl&#39;s mouth with a napkin and the husband only smiled, adoringly. I suddenly yearned for a baby with Levi. *Where was he? How could he go this long and no communication?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has always controlled the lives of my sister and I. That is the reason she stayed this long without marrying. Living his life; the company. But once word got out about his double life, his second family, there was chaos. We pulled free. Amber decided to marry and I transferred back to the states. Baltimore. I only came here for my sister&#39;s wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadness was in his voice and I sympathized with him. I could only imagine what it was like not to have a doting father. Mine died early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am sorry about that.&#34; I managed. I didn&#39;t know how this mattered, but I decided he needed to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really didn&#39;t know Alec&#39;s family. I just knew that they had wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is Baltimore?&#34; I asked, to distract him. He raised his grief stricken eyes.Those eyes didn&#39;t hold their usual charm any longer. Only sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Managing a tentative smile, he croaked a response. Then I allowed him a few moments to gather his element.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry about that night.&#34; His sudden switch of subject, briefly winded me. I didn&#39;t think I was ready to go down this topic. Unfortunately, I saw no reasonable escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For years I&#39;ve wanted to seek you out, apologize. Somehow I just couldn&#39;t. You weren&#39;t on social media. And I didn&#39;t know anyone that had your contact then in high school, apart from Cleo Bran, who died in that accident with her family,&#34; he quietly said. His words struck a nerve and I no longer felt amicable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The death of Cleo and her family had been devastating to me. I had cried for weeks and fell ill. The doctors had recommended an activity I enjoyed. But nothing worked. Mum and Amanda tried different activities to bring me from the horror, but nothing worked. All I saw was the sorrow, the shock they had felt when the accident occurred. How I was never going to see them again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think Alec noticed my sudden disposition and felt contrite. I noticed his remorse, but I didn&#39;t care. I just wanted the night to end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dancing had brought me out of my despair then. Amanda and mum had immediately enrolled me in the Manhattan school of Arts; literally took me there, before I recovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked around and saw dancers, life came back into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps I needed to dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising to my feet, I started walking away. It was rude, dismissing someone like that. But I suddenly felt all the despair again. And I remembered my dream of Levi and I just couldn&#39;t bear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone was calling my name in the distance and I ignored the person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya.&#34; I felt a hand halt me. The touch foreign to me. I turned to look in Alec&#39;s eyes. And the regret I saw told me enough. My face was in anguish. The evidence suddenly trailed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am so sorry, Kenya. I shouldn&#39;t have brought up their death, knowing how close you were.&#34; He admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly pulled me to him, his hug alien but comforting. I cried inside his shirt. Cried for the pain I had felt then, when Cleo died. Cried for the pain I felt now from not hearing a word about another person I loved. I was suffering. I inhaled a shaky breath and pulled away from his strong arms. Putting a safe distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s call it a night, Alec.&#34; I suggested, already walking to the car. The driver and Ryan changed its spot to a few steps from the restaurant. I heard Alec&#39;s hurried steps behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait Kenya. Here&#39;s my number.&#34; He hastily called. He came around and handed me his card. I absently took it, continuing to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got in, I finally breathed in the scent I desired. Levi&#39;s. The entire car smelled of him, and I wanted to cry. But I held myself. I spared Alec a look as we drove, watching him stare after us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, I wished for those eyes to look me in this way. I wished for the touches he spared me tonight. Now I only desired one person. And my heart ached to see him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived the penthouse, I went straight to the gym. He had set up a dance section for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Changing into something comfortable, I played the RnB music I had danced to for Levi in the cave. And I started dancing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I twisted, I twirled. I leaped. My soul reaching God. Crying to Him to bring back Levi. To ensure he was alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dancing was a way I communicated to the Almighty. An extension of my lips. Communicating words my heart was too hesitant to let out. It was me, reaching out to Heaven&#39;s door and imploring God. And now I needed to implore Him to banish this threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had handed me Levi as a gift and treasure in the most unusual way and I had toyed with the gift. Now I needed my Levi back. I felt tears in my face as I danced and I knew that I was crying. And if I didn&#39;t cry now, I&#39;d wake up broken in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, I fell to the ground exhausted. I didn&#39;t even lift my eyes to the clock, I just lay there and slept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby, am home.&#34;</p>
