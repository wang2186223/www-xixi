                <p>&#34;What about Mike and Rory, what&#39;s their take?&#34; I asked, disappointment evident in my voice. i had expected a few drags along the way. Still, encountering them now was unsettling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mike and Rory are in for real. They have been the ones scouting and talking with the others. As a matter of fact, Mike sees the job as Dance director for male students, a great climb. The pay you quotedHe&#34; Andrea hesitated, her eyes holding mine awkwardly. I watched her, wondering.</p>

                <p>&#34;Oh my God, Andy! Congratulations!&#34; I crossed the table and hugged Andrea. We shared a tearful moment, before we pulled back. Sitting back in my seat, I sensed something wrong in Andrea&#39;s demeanor.</p>

                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, Ken. I am not sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean? Sure about what?&#34; I asked, concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About the whole marriage thing.&#34; She shrugged, helplessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, Mike loves you, Andy. He adores you.&#34; I smiled, tenderly. My hands came to hold Andrea&#39;s. My eyes teary. I envied the uncomplicated relationship that Mike and Andrea shared. *Something I might never have with Levi*. Andrea&#39;s eyes watered, doubt, pain and fear, lurking beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am afraid, Ken. What if he is a terrible husband? What if it doesn&#39;t work. You know I used to see my father beat up my mum. Broke my mum&#39;s eye socket. Caused her face to be distorted. If my step father hadn&#39;t been a God&#39;s sent, she would never have found a man with that face again.&#34; Tears slipped down Andrea&#39;s face. I understood her pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had shared her childhood tales with me, when we became friends. A tale, which Andrea had reluctantly narrated. One which had garnered an admiration for Andrea&#39;s mum, from me. It had been a bold move to remarry, after enduring such a grueling ordeal in marriage. To trust again, after such hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andy, your mum&#39;s story isn&#39;t your own.&#34; I quietly started, seeing facial features of Andrea&#39;s mum in my friend. &#34;Although you have her spirit, her courage.&#34; We laughed. &#34;Yet, your stories aren&#39;t the same. Mike is a good man. I have seen how much he loves you. He adores you, Andy. He wouldn&#39;t be the same as your father.&#34; A shadow of uncertainty still held in Andrea&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ButBut what if I am a bad wife. What if I provoke him? Betray him? What if I cause him pain, Ken?&#34; Andrea cried, softly. Doubt drowning her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart tugged, reminding me of last night. The way I had gone about pulling schemes to cause Levi as much emotional damage, as he had caused me. Manipulating Claudine, my sister and brother in-law, with their weaknesses. Manipulating Dave with what he loved best, money. Seducing Levi, just like he had seduced me, knowing the plans I had underway. Knowing the outcome of my seduction. Having a steaming, passionate night with him, which I could never forget. Getting into his heart; cooking for him, dessert, being his dessert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had all been worth it, seeing him manipulated by my own power of seduction. My power as a woman. Succumbing to his sort of games, to get even with him, as well as setting up an achievement for myself. After all, he had urged me to purchase whatever I wanted and I had chosen to purchase new businesses for myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, the end hadn&#39;t felt great. I felt reprehensible. A bad wife. A woman, I wasn&#39;t proud of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have that look?&#34; Andrea asked, her brows raised as she guardedly watched me. I stared, helpless at the consequences of my own actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing, Andrea.&#34; I felt a wetness on my face and dabbed it. I stared in shock at the tears. The guilt inside was torture. And there was something else, which I couldn&#39;t understand. &#34;I stooped low, Andy, that&#39;s all.&#34; I muttered, sniffing. Andrea stared, confused. She couldn&#39;t understand my tears and just reached out to hold me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever it is, Ken, it can be fixed, okay. Just tell me. Trust me, you&#39;ve never stooped low. You are the best person I&#39;ve ever met.&#34; Andrea held me tight, as I cried, softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am afraid, Andy, I am not as good as I thought. These days I don&#39;t even recognize myself.&#34; I confessed, pulling back to clean my eyes with a tissue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrea watched me, wanting to question further, but she didn&#39;t. My friends knew my preference for my privacy. A quality that I have always upheld since I was little. Seeing my anguish, I was grateful that Andrea didn&#39;t press further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think about having a collaboration with Byron&#39;s; J&#39;aime becomes a learning extension of Byron&#39;s. In addition, having paid placement programs organized for the kids with other dance companies?&#34; I asked, sniffing again. My voice hoarse. I had harbored the idea, since I sealed the deal with Dave. But I had wanted to develop it more. Now with the others unsure of my footing, I needed to give them a reason to trust my judgements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LikeI don&#39;t get you, Babes.&#34; Andrea looked confused. Her eyes gazing at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inhaling a steady breath, I explained. &#34;I mean, how about showing these kids something different. Like signing them up with Byron&#39;s to perform at the theater, say quarterly. We select some talented, mature students, they go to perform with professionals in small roles. Exposing them to the world of dancing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At the same time, sharing the spotlight with Dave. Giving the company more public recognition. Parents will see Byron and J&#39;aime, as a formidable pair that promotes career growth in junior and senior dancers. An opportunity for the kids. Subsequently, other dance companies will want to hire the paid services of Byron&#39;s junior team.&#34;</p>
