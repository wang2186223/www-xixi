                <p>He had a gun pointed at Levi&#39;s head, and the sight really scared me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You all saw me as an incapable person, because of my small size. You refused me in your team, because you saw me as inadequate.&#34; Crompton&#39;s incensed voice, filtered into my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned a worried look to Levi, surprised at his calmness. The number of guns pointed at him worried me. And he had come here unarmed, just because of me. None of his men present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crompton actually looked more agitated than Levi, who had guns pointed to his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t choose you, because I didn&#39;t want you soiling your hands like we did.&#34; Levi quietly started. &#34;Worse, I didn&#39;t need you compromising the mission with your carelessness. Just like you carelessly compromised this mission; leading you to being caught.&#34; Levi&#39;s tone was firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am not careless!&#34; Crompton yelled. &#34;I am not careless! Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m careless, like my foster father said I was!&#34; Crompton hysterically yelled. His gun hand shaking, as he tried to maintain a steady hold on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi didn&#39;t even flinch, he only watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was the reason I killed them. My foster parents, they were kind, generous, but they thought I&#39;d ruin the family legacy.&#34; Crompton&#39;s hand lowered, as he began pacing. It was like he was locked in another moment. I was worried for Levi, even though Crompton had already lowered the gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had slipped into the vehicle that had Blake, Rico and the others. No one had noticed. I wanted to be so part of that mission, because I knew you would rule and I wanted to be a part of your new dynasty.&#34; His voice grew shaky. He even sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly felt pity for him. This was a man, who had idolized Levi and had gotten disappointed in his icon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you blew up the place, I had been buried in all the rubble. When the fire fighters came, they had discovered me. Rushed me to the hospital. I had suffered burns on half my body and needed plastic surgery.&#34; He raised his right hand, pulled up his sleeve. The skin was rough. Levi remained impassive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was when the Cromptons came. While I was there, they came to see kids that they were sponsoring. And they heard of me. Mr Greg Crompton had instantly asked that the best team of surgeons be called in. Within hours, they arrived and the surgery was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A few months later, the Cromptons became my new family. Greg and Christy Crompton. They loved me very much. Gave me everything.&#34; Tears rolled down Cromptons eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt his suffering. He was a child that had suffered a lot. They had both gone through a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But they expected much from me. They always reminded me I wasn&#39;t a full blood. That I acted as a ghetto kid. I hated them for that. In spite of their kindness and love, I couldn&#39;t forgive them for the disparagement. It reminded me of how you all treated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I had them killed, when I turned 26. Hacked into the traffic system that night and they all died in that accident that had claimed lives on 57th&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The accident that had killed the Moores?&#34; Levi&#39;s voice icily came. I looked at him, a shadow crossed his face. &#34;People died in that accident, Crompton. And you did that to take vengeance on a family that had taken you in, given you a life&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Correction Ruthford.&#34; Crompton cut in snidely. &#34;I did that to remove them, before they changed their will. They had been threatening to give up everything to charity, if I didn&#39;t act as a Crompton.&#34; He scoffed. &#34;But I guess, they couldn&#39;t take the ghetto from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had heard about that accident on 57th, years ago. I had been fourteen then. It had been a gruesome sight. Lives had been lost that night, because something had happened to the traffic system there. Some notable billionaires had equally been among the casualties. Knowing that this man had been responsible for such carnage, I couldn&#39;t even bring myself to feel sorry for him anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You killed the Moores for that. Does Benjamin know you killed his parents? You two are obviously close that he had given you some information about Belle&#39;s death to have made my wife upset that night of her party,&#34; Levi said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Benjamin just died like an hour before you strolled in.&#34; Crompton smugly declared. My eyes widened in astonishment. &#34;He wanted me to kill you. I wanted you alive so you could watch your defeat, when I became senator, after you withdrew. Now I see you&#39;re no use to me.&#34; Crompton rose from the chair, gun poised. His expression sinister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled in the chair. Levi spared me a look and even winked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*He was in front of a gun, winking?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s play a game, Crompton,&#34; Levi slyly said. Crompton&#39;s expression mirrored mine. Confusion, disbelief. But somehow Crompton took the challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why bother, you already going to lose.&#34; Crompton triumphantly remarked. Levi shrugged casually. &#34;Go for it,&#34; Crompton said, the gun on Levi&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s red and pierces like an arrow?&#34; Levi asked, darkly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*A riddle?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were in shit and Levi was giving a damned riddle. His body language a contrast to the surrounding tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Crompton asked, confused. I was confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dock,&#34; Levi quietly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Bang!*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Bang!*</p>
