                <p>Early the next morning, a Monday, I came out of the gym and strolled into the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His housekeeper handed me two cups of coffee and a large, American Express Mail, which I tucked in the crook of my arm. I strolled upstairs, a smile splitting my face, as I anticipated seeing my beautiful wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Entering the room, I shut the door softly, half expecting Kenya to be out of bed. But to my delight, she was still in bed, her body swallowed by the wave of sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping the coffee cups and the envelope on the nightstand beside the bed, I leaned in and placed a kiss in her hair. She stirred, her body lazily turning to her back, her bare breasts jumping into sight. Desire quaking inside me again, even after I had been utterly drained by our passionate night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to help myself, I lay on the bed and sucked one nipple. Kenya moaned, her body instantly responding to me. She giggled, as she saw I nuzzled her breasts some more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, beautiful.&#34; I smiled boyishly, as she sat upright, a shy grin spitting her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning.&#34; She leaned in and kissed me. I kissed her back and turned around to reach for a cup of coffee for her. She took it and smiled, appreciatively, her naked breasts, covered by one of the sheets. I equally took the other cup and sipped, generously. Leaning my head against the headboard, silently watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I enjoyed last night.&#34; I intoned. My words made Kenya pause. I smiled, amusedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The project at the dance school is almost completed. It just needs some little time. Am sorry that it has taken this long.&#34; My words dragged her eyes to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I promise you that the wages of all your colleagues are still in order.&#34; I watched her, waiting for her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenya only nodded her head. I reached a hand and caressed hers, the contact, surprising her. *Though ours wasn&#39;t a conventional marriage, but I could get used to this. Not fighting*, I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Averting her eyes, demurely, Kenya caught sight of the large, brown envelope, which lay on the nightstand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that?&#34; She asked, returning my attention to the envelope in question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I don&#39;t know.&#34; I turned, picking the envelope. &#34;It says from a Katie Williams, Attorney of law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, ripping the envelope at the same time. Silently, I brought out the papers, documents. Examining them, my earlier desire and playfulness, instantly turned into horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting my gaze to Kenya in disbelief, I muttered. &#34;What is this. Kenya?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze remained on my coffee. My silence infuriating Levi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya!&#34; He growled tightly, &#34;I asked you a question. What the fuck is this?&#34; I could sense his irritation, his rage and *hurt?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained silent, my hands trembling in spite of my calmness. My eyes couldn&#39;t face him; they were fixed on the cup of coffee. But I knew I couldn&#39;t remain silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from the bed, like the bed suddenly singed him, Levi shook the papers in his hand. &#34;Kenya, I have here some Katie Williams stating that she is your attorney and that you have purchased, *J&#39;aime*, as in Claudine&#39;s school. And that from now on, every damned liability is your responsibility?&#34; He raised a questioning brow, his eyes ferocious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inhaling a steady breath, I roused out of the bed. The sheets fell to the floor, but I ignored them, walking around the bed in the direction of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya!&#34; Levi&#39;s voice halted me in my tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around to face his angry stare, I spoke, shakily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That isn&#39;t the only set of documents you should be expecting. Am sure the ones pertaining to my being partners with Dave, Alan and Amanda, would be reaching you soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi frowned, his eyes staring at me in horror. &#34;You can&#39;t do that! AmandaDave, AlanThey all have dirt in their handsAnd if the authorities get to know this about them and you are equally involved, it could land you jail term!&#34; Levi tightly declared, tossing the papers to the bed and coming to hold my shoulders. I defiantly held his gaze, my eyes steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a crack in me. My heart tearing at his words, even though I had guessed that possibility. But this was a risk I was willing to take, to take control of my life again from this man. This man, who had manipulated me, owned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I wanted life on my own terms. Wearing a tight grin, I spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I guess you would have to make certain that the authorities never find out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi&#39;s eyes softened at those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as I have my life back. As long as you feel as hurt as you made me feel, the day you stole my life from me, then it is all worth it.&#34; I spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi&#39;s expression shifted to a bitter look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is about pay back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YesAnd about me having a life for myself.&#34; I sneered. I shrugged his hands off my shoulders, my nude hips swaying, as I turned away from him, heading to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So last night was nothing but a fucking Trojan Horse? The calm before the storm?&#34; Levi accused. His voice came out low, but bitter. An undercurrent of anguish and betrayal, mixed in those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I halted, the words resonating inside me. The pain exuded from them, a thorn, biting into me. A damned arrow, piercing through my heart. For a second, I stood there, questioning the justification behind my recent actions; behind last night. My heart shredding into tiny pieces as the enormity of his accusation sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than responding, I picked my pace, strolling into the bathroom. Shutting the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once I entered the bathroom, I sank onto the cold marble floor. Folding myself in, I allowed sobs wrack my entire body. Pain seeping into me, like cold on a winter morning.</p>
