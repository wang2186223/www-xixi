                <p>***Present day, August 31st***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire school was filled with masked guests, majestically dressed as fairies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in the middle of the hall, wearing a nature fairy mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in silk emerald green, two-piece dress, styled like a Thai Dusit. Spotting a yellow toned veil, which I draped over one side of my shoulders. A pair of pearl and diamond earrings on my ears and my hair in a Grecian style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt beautiful. The men&#39;s eyes undressing me. But none of them was Levi. Tears wet my eyes behind my mask. My heart crushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night Blake called, he hadn&#39;t elaborated more. I tried to get his meaning, but he had politely ignored my questions, rather informing me that Levi was extremely busy. I still felt betrayed by Levi&#39;s sudden indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would have cancelled the party, but Andrea protested against it. Asking me to consider the efforts of everyone that worked for the party. So here I was, maintaining a façade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mum and Alan couldn&#39;t make it. They had to return to Amanda, because she had a panic episode and the kids couldn&#39;t handle her. I wanted to cancel the party and follow them, but mum had protested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would have felt completely alone. Thankfully, Andrea, Rory and Mike were supportive. Andrea and Mike were dressed as fairy King and Queen of love with their matching clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After my opening speech, which went well; considering the number of times I got distracted searching the masked faces of every man for Levi, I went to cry in my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking into sobs, unable to hold my emotions. I could hear music, an indication that the guests were dancing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was happy; eating, drinking. But I was miserable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught a look of myself in the window and cried some more. *How did I become this attached to a man that had killed for my sake? A man that had manipulated me to become his wife.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was easy; he was the most handsome and good natured man I knew. Always putting others first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had people out there asking for him and I just couldn&#39;t manage the lies. Covering up about his wellbeing, when I wasn&#39;t certain myself. I was hanging by a thread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock came on the door, stilling me. I listened and it came again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Infuriated, I opened it to find a waiter, informing me that there was a guest asking for me and Levi. I stayed behind to check myself and left to attend to my guests. The last thing Levi needed now was a dent on his political journey. Some of his party members were present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Mrs Ruthford.&#34; The man lowered his mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the current outgoing Senator of NYC. Mark Marlowe. He was a very quiet and charismatic man, who was equally intelligent and good natured. &#34;A pleasant evening. Congratulations on your opening. It is a beautiful establishment. I would be sure to direct students here. Unfortunately, I have three sons, who are stuck to football like I am.&#34; He playfully informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both laughed. He looked very young for his age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d like to meet them someday, Senator. They sound delightful.&#34; I remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I don&#39;t think delightful is the word that cuts it. Rogues of the highest degree, might do the trick.&#34; He joked. I laughed, a bit soothed. &#34;They are currently on vacation with their mother in Australia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow. All the way,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. My wife has a sister there and we always visit her at this time of the year.&#34; He informed. I nodded in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen or heard from your husband in days. When we call, his personal assistants say he is on a business trip. Is there another way we can get him?&#34; He was calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory had already informed me that many party members and clients were calling and they could barely keep up with the excuses. I didn&#39;t even know what to tell the Senator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitating, my eyes snagged a poster on the wall that had a man drinking a beverage in the tropical heat. An idea struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Senator, my husband is currently in a very remote tropical region. He informed me of his intentions and asked us all not to worry. You shouldn&#39;t as well. Duties of our husbands.&#34; I held a shaky smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched me for a few seconds and nodded in acknowledgement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was aware the senator was very intelligent. But even intelligence had weak spots. Satisfied with my answer, the senator soon jumped to talks about Australia and his family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart beat slowly returning to normal at each story he brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Senator moved on and I walked over to a window, looking outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were upstairs and a few guests toured the premises around me. All happy. But I didn&#39;t have any joy. I stood at the window, trying to hide my misery. I couldn&#39;t keep up with the excuses anymore. And my heart had no more faith to stay strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something happened to my husband and I could feel it. It was a gut feeling, borne out of the love I felt for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not an infatuation like I first perceived. Not spiraling hormones from our steaming lovemaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was truly in love with Levi and It was rooted deep. Tears flowed down my eyes and I covered my mouth, stifling the sobs. I knew what everyone would think as they passed. But I was in agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes clutched tight, blocking everyone out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warmth suddenly travelled through me. Familiar, strong. A tremor awakened inside me at the touch that came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned in, my back coming against the solid form I yearned. My arms were burned from the touch of the only fingers I craved. The warm breath that fanned my neck, reaching my core. I turned to water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t bear seeing you like this. So I braced the elements. I braced death.&#34;</p>
