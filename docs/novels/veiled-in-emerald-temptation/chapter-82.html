                <p>**Kenya.**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>10 pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited in the cave, my body fired up as I anticipated Levi&#39;s return tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I sent him that text, I had no idea what I had been thinking. I only knew that since I heard of his mistresses, I wanted to do more for him. My body was sore from all my practice on the poles in the cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked us to return to the Ruthford mansion, a week ago, for this. And tonight, I was sure that I could finally brace the pole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still felt horrible for my profound confession to him that night. The humiliation at my impulsively blurting out my inner most thoughts, still stung. But that was the truth that night. And I wasn&#39;t changing it. I was falling hard for Levi and I couldn&#39;t even stop it, if I tried. And I didn&#39;t want to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing changed between us since then. Our sex more intimate. My heart entirely invested. He was very supportive these days and it seemed we had finally come around my betrayal to him, when I had seduced him, days back to deliver him my own blow. Announcing my involvement with Claudine, Amanda, Alan and Dave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These days, we talked comfortably about J&#39;aime and even about my involvement with Amanda, Alan and Dave. It was like Levi was now a devoted man to my independence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was preparing more now for the reopening of the school. There was a lot to do. Invitations to send out. Caterers and vendors to engage. Enrollments. Recruitments. And it was all back breaking work. Thankfully, Levi was kind enough to get a P.A to help Andrea and I with everything. And the P.A, Sara, was efficient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the door to the cave open and my heart picked up. My body already reacting to the way his eyes would take me in. My heart quickened as I heard his familiar footsteps. My soul scorched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a few seconds, a fascinated Levi stood a distance. His head tilted, surprise in his eyes, as he appreciatively raked my body whole. I sincerely felt the corset break its lace at the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was wearing a blood red lingerie. The corset, cinching me in the waist, my breasts, pushed up. I felt sultry. My body felt alive. A black, lacy thong and fish net stockings, completed the ensemble. No shoes. I trembled as he watched me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body, my insides a mix of emotions. I looked like a queen of the night, wearing a black lacy choker, necklace. My hair pulled back in a bun to expose my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice, dripping with seduction. He was missing his jacket, tie and his white shirt was opened at the neck. His sleeves rolled up. He looked roguish. Extremely handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to dance for you.&#34; I breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped the pole, my hands shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to do this Kenya. I appreciate you the way you are. Those women were long gone.&#34; He exhaled a shaky breath, closing the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me dance for you, Levi. Let me show you what you mean to me.&#34; I shook on my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted him so much. He assessed me silently. His eyes, lazy. A nod came and I inhaled, shakily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, Levi went to turn on the music, at the same time, dragging a seat below the stage. His eyes darkly watched me. Dripping with desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started. Slow, steady. My pulse beating fast in my chest as I leaped on the stage. I gripped the pole, twirling fluidly and dancing. Using it as my support. I snaked myself around the pole, stretching. I could feel his eyes on me. I knew when he moved, closed the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath fanned me, his hands came to hold my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya&#34; He breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath, smelling of smoke, he lowered his lips to my neck. Kissing me. I moaned. Sweat making my body cool. He pulled away, walking down the stage and pulled a drawer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his hands, he held a pair of black handcuffs. I stilled, watching him. My heart beating fast. Curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What was he doing with handcuffs?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The music continued to play, as he came back on the stage. He kissed me tenderly on the lips, at the same time, he hung the handcuffs over a bar above my head. Clasping the cuffs around my wrists, he held my gaze. The cuffs had soft leather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this what you want?&#34; He asked, darkly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone, menacing. I looked in his eyes. There was something else there. Dark. Hungry. Frightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to treat you like one of them?&#34; He asked, pulling me closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The force made the shackles tug my wrists painfully. I cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what I did with Lola and Jewel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Were those their names?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body fired with jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a word more, Levi pulled my corset free, forcefully. It ripped. I gasped, my breasts coming free. His jaw twitched and he turned me around. My arms hurt, suspended like that in midair. Pressing me into his front, he tweaked my nipples with such pain, until I cried. Tears stung my eyes. At the same time, pleasure coursed through me. My nipples were on fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ground his hips into my butt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t respect them. They were my little freaks. Girls I fucked for pleasure. YouYou I respect. But tonight, you&#39;ll be my little freak.&#34; He pressed me to the pole, shifted my thong. The pull tugged my clit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sucked in air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body pressed tight to the cold pole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*LeviYou&#39;re scaring me*.&#34; I cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Scared. Had I done the wrong thing?* I was petrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body shaking with fear and desire. There was a passion that was ignited. The thought of the danger. Everything coursed through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you scared?&#34; He asked. His voice was thick with want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34;</p>
