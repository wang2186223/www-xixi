                <p>***May 11th, 10 years earlier***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Parties were like glorified sessions, where everyone showed off their clothes and charm. I didn&#39;t enjoy them. But I had to, if I wanted to familiarize myself with the proper society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being neck deep in the shadow world for almost a decade, it was hard to see these people as who they were supposed to be; humans. I knew most of their dark secrets. Had them in my archives for future purposes, so I barely had any respect for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>King of New York for the past 6 years, wealthy as Croesus; it was time to step up and have a face. I owned a large Construction company. A graduate of MIT. I was very notable in the society. I was now a politician. A democrat and this was just one of several parties I had to attend, every other Saturday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked casually, greeting the other party members, the ladies swooning. I didn&#39;t see them. I had my pick of ladies. I had my lil freaks at an exclusive club of which I was a member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sipping from my drink, I discussed casually with former Congressman Christopher Moore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, the man had climbed high and was highly respected in the society. I had drawn close to him, immediately I had shown interest in a political career, five years ago. And somehow the man had seen my rise to power again, after our fall from grace, a wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Levi, wouldn&#39;t you run for congress, as I suggested to you? I&#39;d stand by you, if that is your issue.&#34; He dangled before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, slyly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I turned 25, earlier this year, it had become a task for Christopher, pestering me, endlessly to run for congress. I wasn&#39;t interested in the small task. If I was going to run for election, I was heading for the big fry. *Senator*. Rather than controlling just a district of New York.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t tell him. Not yet, anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched the man, who had abandoned us in our time of woe and concluded that truly, people only celebrated success. And that is what Christopher Moore had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother and I, who he hadn&#39;t bothered to search for after dad&#39;s death, had become valued friends, shortly before her death, five years ago. I was twenty years old at the time, and now controlled most of the dark undertakings in New York. Nothing occurred, without my permission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had hosted a housewarming party at her new Malibu home; something to make her alive again, after she had been diagnosed with cancer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dignitaries had attended. Christopher had been one of the guests. Coming as Mark Marlowe&#39;s plus one; close friends then. Obviously attending to validate news about us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My daughter, Belle, has been talking nonstop about her fascination with the Ruthford mansion.&#34; Christopher broke into my thoughts, excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tilted my head, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Your daughter?* I thought you had only a son?&#34; I asked. I didn&#39;t know much about the family, when I was younger. But I recalled they had this little boy back then, who always trudged after Mrs Moore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christopher grinned. &#34;Belle is our daughter. My son&#39;s twin. She schooled in a private boarding school in Philadelphia, most of her growing age. That is why you presumed so.&#34; He clarified. I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*That explained it.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is she? Is she here, by any chance, so I can formally invite her tobthe grounds on a tour, say next weekend.&#34; I offered. Christopher beamed elatedly now. His face couldn&#39;t contain the joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Greedy man.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No she isn&#39;t. She&#39;s currently handling some issues with our company&#39;s Chicago branch.&#34; Christopher revealed. I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nevertheless. My doors are open to all of you. Just have her call me, whenever she wants a tour of the mansion.&#34; I repeated and went on to talk to some other members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to dispel the revulsion I felt for this man, who had abandoned my family when we fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, a Miss Belle Moore is here for you.&#34; My secretary said to me over the phone. &#34;She has no appointment, Sir. But she claims you asked her to call, whenever she was around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had just finished a meeting and was tending to some pending matters on the computer, when my secretary called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure the reason Belle hadn&#39;t called instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell, I hadn&#39;t even given any further thought to her, since two weeks ago, at the party. But I allowed her in, nonetheless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, Miss Moore walked into my office and I was spell bound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tall, slender, her curves perfect, I wondered how I managed not to stare. She was wearing cobalt blue knee length dress that accentuated her turquoise blue eyes. Her striking blonde hair held in a ponytail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I strolled to her, extending her a handshake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Moore, a pleasure to meet you at last.&#34; I smiled, charmingly. She wore these matching, pointy heeled shoes. Still I towered over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The pleasure is all mine, Mr Ruthford.&#34; Her smile was flirtatious and instantly took the hint. Drinking her in. She spotted some freckles on her long neck, which was in my full view, thanks to her low neckline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After offering her a seat, we talked about our businesses. Her family was one of the largest cement manufacturing industries in the States. And she was really well informed about the runnings. *Impressive*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So tell me, Miss Moore, would you like a private tour, accompanied with dinner at the Ruthford Mansion, this weekend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*How was it possible that I had never seen this vixen? I would have charmed her, long ago.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you asking me to dinner, Mr Ruthford?&#34; She asked, innocently. Her voice beautiful. But her gaze on me wasn&#39;t so innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what if I am, Belle?&#34; I said her name like a caress on my tongue, so she would get my meaning. I wanted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused. Examining me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I accept your invitation, Levi.&#34;</p>
