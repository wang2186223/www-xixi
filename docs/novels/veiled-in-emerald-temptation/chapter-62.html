                <p>Blake raised a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the 21st century, you want to sue a woman for maintaining her independence.&#34; Blake intoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him, already feeling stupid. *God! She was mushing my brain*!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t independence! If Kenya wishes for independence, I&#39;d buy her the freaking world. This is mere spite!&#34; I bellowed, my anger rising. I crossed to a window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake inhaled behind me and I already hated his next words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t hold her back. It&#39;s infringement. If she goes to court, you&#39;d lose before a judge for trying to deprive her of her rights to freedom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An awareness crossed my expression. I knew what he was saying. He was absolutely right. If she ever reported such about me, I would lose my marriage. And worse, I never advocated such behaviors; depriving the rights of women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake came behind me, placing a palm over my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give her a chance. Watch her grow from this. I have interacted with her before and she is an intelligent woman. She knows more upstairs than you give her credit for. And for her to have come up with this ploy, it shows how clever she is.&#34; Blake mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile of appreciation lit my face at his comment. He was right, she was a strategist. I released my breath. I didn&#39;t even know that I had been holding it in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get me her attorney&#39;s attention. And get ready for us to go on a trip.&#34; I stated, firmly. My eyes absently gazed out my window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang, and I picked it from my pocket. Andrea Macgregor, flashed on the screen. Kenya&#39;s friend. I frowned as I answered the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr RuthfordSir. It&#39;s Andrea, Kenya&#39;s friend&#34; She stuttered. I heard panic in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I asked, alarmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s KenyaSSomething happened...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; I asked, tightly. My heart already racing, uncontrollably, as her words sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She in the hospital Sir... She&#39;s had an accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blanched. My blood ringing in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was 5 pm in the evening. Dusk already around the corner, as I gazed at Kenya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I arrived here hours ago, after Andrea&#39;s call, I had sat here, devotedly. My fingers laced with Kenya&#39;s, as she lay in the hospital bed, sedated and well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***5 hours ago***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t wait for Andrea&#39;s details on the accident. I only entered my car, arriving the hospital at break neck speed. I expected the traffic violation tickets later, but fuck if I cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hospital, I immediately headed for the ward Andrea had named. No one stopped me as I rushed to the ward. I was like a mad man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya!&#34; I called, as I barged into the room. I saw a contrite Andrea and a couple of young men, all seated around my wife. I had been introduced to all three of them, that night at our reception. But I hadn&#39;t taken note of the men then. To me, they had just been young men circling round two friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andrea stepped forward to meet me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Ruthford&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spared her no look, as I brushed, past her to go and sit beside my wife. Andrea inched closer, her tone grave. I saw her suffering, being Kenya&#39; best friend, but I didn&#39;t even try to ease it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Ruthford.&#34; Came one of the men, boldly. I liked that about him. I was usually unapproachable, when I was upset. In the past, only Blake knew how to reach me in such moment. Now, Kenya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is Rory Crower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my gaze to his. He fidgeted a little, at my expression. I didn&#39;t need to guess what he saw there. But the man persisted. He couldn&#39;t be much older than Kenya, but he had spunk. I&#39;d give him that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This here is Mike Flips and Andrea is the one who called you earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swept a gaze around them. The other man, Mike, was already holding Andrea tenderly. A small kiss on her lips. *A couple. Then what did that make Mr Crower here in the group?* I mused. I raised a brow at him. He saw my expression, but if he understood it, he didn&#39;t show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We came as soon as she called us as well. We were nearby. I am sorry Sir.&#34; He sympathized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled a breath, dispelling the anger that rose to bait me, while I pondered the role of this young pup in my wife&#39;s life. *Could he have been a potential lover, who I had stolen her from. She never stopped reminding me of how I had stolen her life.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; I managed, my eyes on Kenya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We went to the building site because I asked us to take a look at it. While we were there, a foreman was giving us a tour of the place. But she seemed distracted and was staring at something. I didn&#39;t even know when she had slipped away from us. Then she called and said there was a kid down a scaffold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brows. *&#34;A kid*?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So she said. But when we got there, there was no one and she was above a scaffold. We asked her to come down, the foreman inching closer to help her. But she adamantly stayed put. Then I heard her say, &#39;gotcha.&#39; And before you knew it, she slipped from the scaffold and fell. We rushed her here immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is the foreman?&#34; I asked, tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He left, moments before you came. He said you&#39;d need a detailed report on the incident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Ryan, her bodyguard? And how could you have suggested a tour on a building site?!&#34; My tone was raised an octave higher, as I glared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored the protective stance of her lover, who defended her, immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s equally suffering, Mr Ruthford. We all are. Kenya is our friend. We have known her longer than you. We care for her as much as you do.&#34;</p>
