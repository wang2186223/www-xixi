                <p>***Levi.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care what this could cost my political career. But having Kenya loathe me further, was just horrific.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely speaking to me since that Saturday night, with just a few words spoken with contempt, I wondered how I still held desire for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night she had raged at me, I had been astonished at her words, which had stung greatly. Left speechless, guilt eating me, because her words had truth. A reminder of my cruelty. A reaffirmation my unworthiness. Yet, I buried all the emotions. Choosing to ignore the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, I had returned to the party, only to discover that my wife was nowhere. I had immediately returned home, to find her absent. Worried, I had her tracked. She had stopped by her old apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited for her in the living room, late into the night. My emotions stretched thin. Her eventual return later at night, had only met my questioning expression with her indifference. Kenya had brushed past me like I didn&#39;t exist, like my concern didn&#39;t matter. And that had hurt. Preferring to give her the much needed space I believed she deserved, I hadn&#39;t pressed further that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when she woke up, the following morning, did I deliver the news to her, that she was to be escorted by a bodyguard without arguments. Not ready to put her life on the line, after Saturday night, where I had been worried about her, I had made my decision. An unwelcomed decision, if her glare that morning could stand as an emotion, but one taken in good stride, nonetheless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this new development, I could only imagine her distraught if she ever found out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later in the day, My phone buzzed with an incoming message from Blake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Blake: Journalist would wait for you at the abandoned building site, Harlem. Pick up at 7PM.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Would be waiting.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up from my cell phone in time to hear a commotion at the door. The door burst open, only for Carmen Strad, two of my guards posted at the door and my secretary, to all scramble in, my Secretary hurrying to stand before me. Her face drawn in apprehension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am sorry, Mr Ruthford. But Miss Strad came in without an appointment. I tried to&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright, Renee. You can all return to duties.&#34; I instructed, sweeping my gaze across my staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the clock, it was already 5pm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had expected Carmen sooner. Perhaps she had waited this long, because she knew that the staff would be closing for the day by now. Just like old times, when she had artfully convinced me to put my figures in her business, two years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the door clicking shut after my employees exited the room, filled the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why, Levi? Why would you pull out your stocks from AUDACIOUS? And worse, I have not rested from callsInvestors informing me that they are done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carmen glared at me, her composure cracking under her alluring demeanor. She wore a peach colored two-piece suit. The white silk camisole peeking out, revealing the small &#39;V&#39; of her cleavage. She had her hair held in a low bun, with some stray strands hanging out. I leaned back, silently observing her from expressionless eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it your wife that asked you to do this? She told you what happened, isn&#39;t it?&#34; Carmen asked, infuriated. She turned away from me for a moment, her shoulders stiffening. Sagging her shoulders, she turned back to face me. Her red rimmed eyes, softening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ican&#39;t believe you could do this to me, after all we had. I never knew you to take orders from women, Levi. You have always been different. Impervious to others. That is one thing I admired about you.&#34; She came around the desk, until she sat on it, next to me. Her perfume, an expensive blend of flowers, filled my space. But I didn&#39;t even flinch. Trembling, Carmen took one of my hands, lacing her fingers in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you listen to your wife and ruin an arrangement we had, Levi.&#34; She held my fingers tight. I said nothing, only allowed my gaze linger on her. Her mask of calm breaking, Carmen lowered herself to her knees and reached for my fly. In one swift move, Levi instinctively held her hands in a tight grip, my gaze narrowed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even think about it.&#34; I growled, furious. Carmen&#39;s face twisted in horror, fear gripping her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You insulted my wife, you insulted me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Butwhy would you listen to herwhy don&#39;t you listen to my side of it?&#34; She asked, nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t tell me anything, Carmen. Crawford did. And you know what it did?&#34; I released her hands, dropping them gently to her sides. Carmen shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It reminded me of your status, Carmen. So I had to put you where you belong.&#34; I stated. Carmen parted her lips in shock. Tears pooled. She shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t Levi. It would ruin me. Already, Copeland, Bethel, Macklesfield, they&#39;ve sent their notices. They&#39;ve pulled out. The rest will follow, Levi. They will all pull out their stocks. It would ruin me, Levi.&#34; Carmen cried, a harsh sob tearing through her. &#34;I was loyal to you, Levi. You can&#39;t do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was dead. I walked to the window. The rain stopped minutes ago, the city already lit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were also a loyal whore to each of the names you just called, Carmen and many more. I am sure you&#39;d survive.&#34; I heard her gasp. Her reputation was renowned in my circle. I turned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to ever see you anywhere near my wife or anything that concerns her again. If I do, then you wouldn&#39;t even have any stocks left to run your skin line business. Be grateful you were very good with your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, I gathered my items and stalked out of the room.</p>
