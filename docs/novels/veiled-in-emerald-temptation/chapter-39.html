                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I opened the door, I came face to face with Levi pummelling a man on the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had the man flat on the desk, his fists raining down on him. I pushed past the doorway, horrified at the sight. My voice loud, as I called him repeatedly to stop. But he didn&#39;t hear me. He continued. At some point I struggled to pull him free, but Levi was too heavy and strong for me. It was like he was in another world. I whimpered, the man&#39;s gurgling sounds, breaking me. His face, bloodied. Even Levi&#39;s fists were covered in blood. I touched the hand, whimpering at all the blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then he stilled, turning to me and our eyes held for a moment. His softened and I took it as a cue, pulling him towards me. He followed, and I sat him in the chair, while I sat in his lap, holding his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are mad!&#34; The other man dripped with pain and indignation. He staggered to his feet, clutching his bloodied face. We turned to him, and I saw Levi tense again. &#34;I&#39;d have you for this! You think this is over. I am still an American you bastard!&#34; The man sneered as he staggered. Levi glared at him, coldly. His palm still in mine. I rubbed it soothingly, calming him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The next time I see you near my tuff, your bloodied face would be the only thing left of you.&#34; Levi warned, coldly. I gasped and turned to see the cold stare he wore. It seemed the man got the message as he stood, horror struck. Without saying another word, the man staggered out of the room. Leaving us alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The music filtered in, but it didn&#39;t banish the tension that remained. I shook in fright at seeing Levi in such a state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rushed to open the next door, which turned to be a bathroom. Then I searched the cabinets, until I found a first aid kit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rushing to Levi&#39;s side, I sat down on the desk, pulling his bruised fist into my lap. I didn&#39;t mind the blood, all that mattered was cleaning him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently, I began cleaning the bruise with some alcohol. No flinch. He only watched me from hooded eyes. His expression, unreadable. I wanted to talk, but I chose to allow the silence, knowing that he needed calmness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t have encountered the scene, if I hadn&#39;t been on my way from the restroom, where I had gone to freshen up. On Kirsten&#39;s counsel, I had gone to clean my face, from my crying in her presence. In the bathroom, I got a call from Andrea that they had arrived the party, including my two bosses; Claudine and Dave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I had finished with reapplying some makeup, before I came back downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, I lost a turn on my way and found myself searching for the way. Only for me to hear raised voices behind a door. I leaned in, recognizing Levi&#39;s voice. I heard the cruel words said by the man and I had shrinked back in mortification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to step back, to avoid the hurtful words, then I heard the first punch. And the grunting. It didn&#39;t stop and so I pushed the door open, coming face to face with Levi punching a man&#39;s face in for insulting me. I was too shocked at first to find ease at his defense for me. Stunned seeing Levi in such ferocity. The rage pouring out in every delivered punch. My heart soared with a twisted mix of ache and pride, seeing him fighting someone for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then my wits came back as soon I heard the man&#39;s gurgling sounds and I rushed to Levi&#39;s side. Trying to stop him from his bloodshot state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to punch him like that because of me, Levi.&#34; I muttered as I dabbed the hand with some ointments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me an indiscernible and intense look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one insults what belongs to me,&#34; he simply replied. I watched him. The heated gaze in his eyes, already conjuring a familiar spell. His phone rang in his pocket, jolting us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Blake. Get him Moore out. We&#39;ll be right there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard him say over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. More guests have arrived. Even your friends.&#34; We both stared at the hand and he shrugged off my concern. This conversation isn&#39;t over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party ended way into midnight. I had applauded myself for my comportment throughout the party, especially after my encounter in Levi&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi distractedly attended the rest of the party. His gaze barely taking in everything. For once, I had seen a chink in Levi&#39;s stoic demeanor. And the sight tormented me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had seen Andrea, my colleagues, Claudine and Dave, all of whom were shocked and excited at my sudden rise in status. Claudine had shown unfailing enthusiasm at seeing me finally married to the man, who had already done so much for her dance school. And Dave, well Dave had only come to congratulate me for not disappointing him. I couldn&#39;t help but appreciate their solidarity and had declared my gratitude at their presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had danced with my husband and a few guests at the party. And had even tasted of the rich buffet of delicious foods that had arrayed the refreshment table. Spring rolls, petit fours, small cakes, diced, cold meats; all tasty treats that wet all our palates. In addition, I found a certain ease at the entire turn of events. But I couldn&#39;t help but ignore the absence of life in Levi&#39;s usually sparkling emerald eyes. Oddly, I had found that I missed that seductive spark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep need for Levi suddenly crawled inside me as I gazed at the mirror, taking down my earrings. Recalling our first night together as husband and wife. I needed him. Desire pooled in my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling hot at the thoughts, I went downstairs for water.</p>
