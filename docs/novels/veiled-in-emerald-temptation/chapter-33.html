                <p>It was Thursday, the following day. About 48 hours since I got married. I should have felt different, like they said a woman did after her wedding, but I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed through my side of the window at the lush landscape of Irvington village, as the SUV drove us to the Ruthford family estate. Just a few minutes&#39; drive from Manhattan. The beauty of the place as we drove past was remarkable and I couldn&#39;t help but watch the landscape unfold, as the car drove through the quaint village. The village was embedded in a gorgeous shelter of towering forest trees that gave me a welcoming distraction. The unique architectural designs, captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Popular for the Hudson river, I couldn&#39;t keep at bay the excitement I bore to see the place, since I got to know our destination earlier that morning. I hadn&#39;t even been able to hide my excitement from Levi, even though I had tried to mask it. I had caught the glint in his eyes as he had watched my reaction, after informing me. And when I had put back on my wall of indifference, he had simply gone with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in the car now, after alighting the plane, I shifted my focus to my phone rather than my husband&#39;s very handsome form beside me. He was dressed in a casual blue &#39;T-shirt and black Jeans. His black blazer draped over the back of his seat. I couldn&#39;t help my admiration for the man, even though I detested him. His freshly trimmed facial hairs. His jet black hair, freshly cropped and tussled, all made him look roguish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you keep staring like that, your eyes will fall out.&#34; Levi&#39;s teasing voice broke through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I startled. Heat flooding me from embarrassment. Shuffling in discomfort at being caught, I hastily returned my gaze to my phone. A text came in from Andrea, asking about the style they were to wear for the wedding reception later in the evening. I huffed, irritated at the reminder of my situation. I had invited my entire colleagues, even Claudine and Dave for the party. Mum and Amanda had other prior engagements, so they weren&#39;t attending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone hadn&#39;t stopped ringing since the news of my marriage to Levi broke last night. And I had said the same thing over and over again that I was sure I had rattled those same words in my dreams last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Yes, I am now Mrs Ruthford.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Yes, we are in love.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*&#34;Yes, we are inviting you all for the formal reception.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had felt so exhausted, saying those words through my teeth that I had tossed my phone far away to get a decent sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Levi had ditched me in my aroused state, last night, I had struggled to sleep. Tossing in bed. My body wound up tight from all the burning need of him I felt within me. My body, treacherous. My face still burned from embarrassment, every time I recalled how he had raised me to a state of orgasmic craze, only to leave me to a free fall. My inner turmoil, unabated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An incoming call from Mum broke my disquieted thoughts, dragging me back to the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi mum.&#34; I answered, exasperated. Mum&#39;s weeping at the other end, suddenly alarmed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mum, what&#39;s wrong, why are you crying?&#34; I asked, alarmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me that you had been burgled and gravelly injured in that school of yours a month ago, J&#39;aime.&#34; She cried, her voice crippling me. I inhaled deeply, wondering how Mum got to find out. She didn&#39;t take bad news well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HowHow did you know?&#34; I managed, the grimness in my voice, catching Levi&#39;s focus. Our gazes locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to hear from the news this morning. Apparently, there was a fire and you had been hurt, to the point Levi had brought you to the hospital that night. The hospital had confirmed it.&#34; Mum cried. She felt betrayed. My insides twisted with guilt. I should have confessed to her. Somewhere along the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hospital shouldn&#39;t have done that, mum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Levi with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; At her request, I gave Levi the phone. I barely heard all she told him. By the time the phone was returned, she was more soothed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the call ended, I turned to Levi. &#34;What did she tell you?&#34; I was helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was displeased that I hadn&#39;t encouraged you to tell her about the incident, even after the wedding. She was just worried about you.&#34; He was tender. He put aside his laptop and focused his eyes on me. My eyes searched his for any evidence of sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just like I assured her.&#34; He pulled my palms into his. His warmth, my comfort. &#34;I would handle all this negative publicity. As a matter of fact, my PR team is on it as we speak. And after tonight, everything would turn out alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words would have calmed me. Should have calmed me. And it almost did. With the way he said them, tenderly. They penetrated and soothed me. Sadly, I thought about how much of my life had been disrupted by this one act of his. This unconventional marriage arrangement and I couldn&#39;t help but feel sorry for myself. Yes, I was grateful for how he rescued me from Hank and I could never show enough gratitude. But I couldn&#39;t ignore the feeling that this man&#39;s presence in my world was going to cost me more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling my hands slowly from his, distaste climbing my throat, I shifted my gaze to the line of trees and buildings that came into view, as the car pulled into Hudson Coast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds later, my phone beeped in my lap with an incoming message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Unknown number****: &#34;Hey beautiful! I hope you are smiling. I wanted to ensure that you keep your smile on, no matter what.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*11:20am.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile crept in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me****: I just smiled. Thank you.&#34;*</p>
