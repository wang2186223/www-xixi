                <p>***Levi***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Monday... Next day...*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>11 am. We just left the private strip where my plane touched down. I was being driven to the address Blake had tracked for me. My heart soared with an unidentifiable emotion. But I replaced it with rage. *She dared to run*! *I wouldn&#39;t spare her*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I futilely called Kenya endlessly, yesterday. My mind frustrated. Barking at everyone, until she had been tracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things shouldn&#39;t have unfolded thus. But now they did. I had to salvage what I got.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed in my pocket. I scooped it out. A message from a hidden number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;**Unknown Number:** *I shouldn&#39;t contact you. But this is an emergency. Someone is fishing about your businesses; mines and plantations. We laying low for a while.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stilled, pinching the bridge of my nose in frustration. *This can&#39;t be happening now. Who could that be?* I needed to get my shit together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;***Me***: *Okay Rico. Keep me updated.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a few seconds, the car pulled up in front of a fine beach house on Miami Street. Modest and beautiful. A small patch of trimmed lawn, with fine flowers, graced the surroundings. I was impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strolling up the cobblestone walkway, I reached the front door. The door opened after a couple of rings. An older version of Kenya, before me. She was beautiful and cheerful. I had seen her photos from the dossier I had on Kenya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs Anderson. We finally met.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze fixed on me. Surprised. &#34;Oh my God! Mr Ruthford. Please come in.&#34; She shifted. I walked into a wonderful house, smelling of roses, citrus and some baking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was in front of me, smiling. &#34;This is a surprise. Kenya didn&#39;t tell me you were coming. I&#39;d have made preparations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She isn&#39;t expecting me. Can I see her?&#34; I smiled. My heart raced in anticipation. She nodded, a knowing smile crossing her face. I didn&#39;t understand it. Moving away, she called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya, someone is here for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited. My heart thudded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenya came out soon, standing in front of me. My heart stopped. Simple, beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing me, her face paled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Kenya. Miss me?&#34; I asked, quietly. Smiling. Kenya trembled. *God! I thought I had lost her.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh honey, say something.&#34; Her mother pushed, softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi, I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. You missed me, baby.&#34; I finished for her, closing the distance between us. I towered over her. Dark, foreboding as I stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a gentle grip, I took her hand. A tender kiss on her lips accompanied that action. She didn&#39;t resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Mr Ruthford. I am so happy you came. At least you can distract her. She has been sad since yesterday,&#34; her Mum intoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled back, holding her eyes in a tender gaze. &#34;Is that true, Baby? What&#39;s making you sad?&#34; I asked, concerned. She flinched from my touch. Her eyes, like daggers, were glaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. Am fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I studied her expression, hoping she wasn&#39;t sad about that wretch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do hope you will be staying long. We were just making strawberry tarts before you arrived.&#34; Her Mum offered, breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spared her mother a glance, since the kiss. A bright smile split my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be staying until my task is done, Mrs Anderson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned a knowing look to Kenya, a possessive hand caressing her lower back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And rest assured, it&#39;d be a pleasure tasting something you both prepared,&#34; I continued, my eyes back on her Mum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs Anderson&#39;s warm smile betrayed her excitement, as she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here? How did you find me?&#34; Kenya turned a despairing gaze at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at her, replying, &#34;I tried calling you yesterday, and it seemed my calls to you were hindered.&#34; I looked at her, meaningfully. Noticing her discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I stopped by your apartment and discovered that you weren&#39;t home. I called Dave, and he hadn&#39;t seen you.&#34; I let my words sink in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted uncomfortably, walking to the open window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it hit me,&#34; I continued, lightly. &#34;You jilted your soon-to-be husband...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You aren&#39;t soon to be anything.&#34; She sharply retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled darkly, coming closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had you tracked and received this address last night.&#34; I watched her face. My words affecting her. Yes, I was in possession of the address, since last night. But I wanted to give her time to enjoy one last freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You tracked me?&#34; She was frightened. I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already know what I want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it would be torture... Marrying you...&#34; She whispered in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed at her, the old tenderness I had for her surfacing. But I dispelled it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had initially given you until Saturday.&#34; I ignored her. &#34;But now, you have until tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow morning?&#34; She gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Tomorrow morning a vehicle will arrive to convey you to the chapel where we will wed. Everything will be ready on your arrival, so don&#39;t worry about anything,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horrified, she stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t do it? I wouldn&#39;t. You can do whatever you want,&#34; She defiantly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, I shifted to a window. A beautiful view of the beach this was. Just like my Malibu beach house. I hadn&#39;t been there in years. I grew nostalgic. My gaze fell on a man and woman, kissing on the sandy beach. Enthralling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have sent all the evidence to the D. A&#39;s office in Manhattan. I don&#39;t need to tell you what that entails,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped. Regret at my next words, eating me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there is no command from me, by the end of tomorrow, they will go ahead with the proceedings. And the culprits will be caught and prosecuted. A detrimental blow to your family, Kenya.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you doing this, Levi...&#34; Her voice broke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes lingered on the beach. My emotions schooled, as that familiar tenderness painfully resurfaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you are the bane of my sanity. To be sane, I need all of you.&#34;</p>
