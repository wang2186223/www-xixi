                <p>***July 7th, 19 years earlier***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi. You have proven yourself a formidable member of the group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I steadied my eyes on Rowan in his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride should have soared in me at his compliment and confidence, rather there was hate. A mean, despicable man, who exploited desperate kids for his dirty work. Raising an army of misfits. I hated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadly, I was now one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning a smile, I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since January, I had worked tirelessly, furtively. Proving myself to Rowan. Showing I belonged with them, because I had no alternative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had successfully finished my first assignment, under seven months. *The initiation mission*, they called it. A task I was told, other kids weren&#39;t able to complete that soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bringing in valuable loots had been the task. And with my background, I had been able to successfully lead a team of the gang to ransack wealthy families. Surrendering the spoils to Rowan&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight I was to be given my second task. Like a graduation ceremony. I snorted inwardly. I could take them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you succeed in this, you would become a fledged member of the family. You&#39;d choose your name. The tattoo you want. Additionally, you&#39;d get a gift from me. Anything you want.&#34; Rowan revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cocked my head, weighing his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warning alarm suddenly rang in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What was the task?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head, when I saw his raised brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon he took me downstairs, where he had called an assembly of the other members. About 50 youths of varying ages surrounded Rowan. For weeks I had been futilely trying to discern his heritage and age from his appearance. He looked around his thirties and none of the others knew a thing about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tonight, Levi here would do his second task!&#34; Rowan swept a hard gaze around. His voice commanding as he spoke. I stood beside him, my insides quaking. Ignoring that warning bell still ringing in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has been able to do his initiation task, efficiently and now, we proceed to the next task. Freddy Scissors!&#34; Rowan focused his gaze on Freddy. &#34;Step forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freddy raised a puzzled look at Rowan, before he guardedly stepped forward. Standing at Rowan&#39;s other side, he cut me a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In this family, I do not promote betrayal and division. I have taken you all as my children. And that is what I expect from every one of you.&#34; Rowan shifted a steady look to Freddy, whose face suddenly paled. I silently watched, wondering what this had to do with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By my side is Freddy, who recently came to me, asking I got rid of Levi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps went round the room, while I looked at Rowan in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In his own words, &#39;Ask me to and I will get rid of him forever from the gang. He feels too special to be among us.&#39; Weren&#39;t those your exact words, Freddy?&#34; Rowan fully turned to Freddy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared in horror. The enormity of Freddy&#39;s words sinking in. *He wanted me dead*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From my position, I saw Freddy&#39;s ashen face, etched with alarm. I was too bewildered to even speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What had I done to the guy to make him want me dead?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apart from the day we had had that altercation, I had taken care not to ever cross paths with him again. *Had that made me arrogant?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listened to him trying to defend himself, anger suddenly simmering in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;RowanI came to you in good faith. This guy isn&#39;t good for us.&#34; Freddy claimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there watching Freddy ramble on, like he was bargaining some groceries, while Rowan silently listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi.&#34; Rowan called coldly. I hesitated, already quaking inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; I drew closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From inside his back pocket, Rowan pulled out a black glock. Extending the magazine to me, drawing my horrified gaze. I hesitated, my eyes staring down at the gun briefly, before raising them back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take this gun and shoot Freddy.&#34; It was a cold blooded order. One devoid of human compassion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rowan, what the fuck?&#34; Black Pea came forward, standing in front of Rowan. &#34;What are you doing? There&#39;s no need for that.&#34; Black Pea protested. He shifted an alarmed gaze from me to Rowan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have I said about back stabbing in the gang?&#34; Rowan directed at Black Pea. The question seemed to have taken him by surprise, as he silently locked gazes with Rowan. The intensity that stemmed between them, threw the entire room into a deafening silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like forever, but Black pea, defeated, finally shifted a wary gaze to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A life for a life. We&#39;re all expendable to him. Tonight it&#39;s Freddy&#39;s life for yours. Someday, he&#39;d ask for your head. Enjoy it while you still gat it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were bitter, ominous. Sending chills down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking one last look at Freddy, Black Pea returned to his spot amongst the others. Watching from expressionless eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take the gun, Levi.&#34; Rowan pressed. My fingers shook, my eyes shifting to Freddy again. &#34;Or I&#39;d shoot him.&#34; Rowan instantly pointed the gun in the direction of Blake Dickson, AKA Mini Dick. The smallest boy in our midst, who had accompanied me in my initiation tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake&#39;s tiny face paled, frightened. I was frightened too. The others silently watched. Scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot Rowan a panicked look and he cocked the gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NoNo. I&#39;d do it.&#34; I hastily took the gun from him and came to stand before Freddy. My hands shook, as I held the gun to his face. Emotions coursed through me all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic for little Blake&#39;s life. Fear. Finally anger at Freddy&#39;s intent to kill me won. The fact that I would have been the one at the other end of the gun, fueled my rage. Pain. Without further hesitation, I looked Freddy in the eyes, my face blank. And I fired his heart, like he would have fired mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Branded for life.*</p>
