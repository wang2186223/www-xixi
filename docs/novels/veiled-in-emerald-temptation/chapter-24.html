                <p>&#34;They sent their regards before they left. They wanted to see you, but had other prior engagements.&#34; I spoke, my eyes remaining on the sea, before us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenya maintained her silence. After a long pause, I turned my eyes to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you wear the diamond necklace that I got made for the occasion?&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t it to your liking?&#34; I pressed. A soft sigh escaped her lips, as she retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I had my way, I would have worn an all-black to the wedding Black dress and veil, shoes and roses so dark...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>mourning my loss.&#34; She sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That stung. Her indignation was justified. And so we&#39;re my actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silence lingered. My thoughts forming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of that dreadful night came flooding back as I talked shakily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Six Weeks Ago...***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the successful exclusive with Shirley, I remained with my campaign team, long into the night. We watched the reactions of people in the media. My entire team was filled with happiness at the results and comments that flooded the polls. Celebratory Pizza and drinks were ordered, and we all partook in the feast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my happiness wasn&#39;t complete, until I saw Kenya, the woman, who had boldly counseled me to be as transparent as I could. I yearned to see her, so I called her, but to no avail. I even called the theater, but was told she was at J&#39;aime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I asked to be driven there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alighting the vehicle, we sensed something off. The sounds of breaking glass alerted us. So we took cover, treading cautiously into the building. The place was vandalized. Broken glass, strewn clothes. It was appalling. I feared the worst for Kenya then, like a knife twist in my gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We came to a halt at a horrid sight. My fear unfolded, as I saw three men looming over a naked and limp Kenya on the floor. Horrified, fear gripped me. I was uncertain if she was alive as I watched for any signs of movement from her. And worse was that these men had</p>
                
                
                
                <p>their hands touching her lewdly, not minding, she was lying there limp and undressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grew livid, wanting to lurch for the men. But I knew that emotions didn&#39;t pose well in such moments and decided to think with a clear head. Schooling my rage, I assumed a part of me which I had put away for many years. Patiently watching the scene that unfolded through blood-shot eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Counting only three men, I looked out for an opening. The men suddenly fell into a sickening argument about whom to go first, posing an opening. And just when one of the men, who I later got to know as Hank, lowered himself into her naked form, her legs spread beneath him, I pulled out my flick blade and threw it at the man. The knife hit its mark and pierced through his right thigh, a scream escaping him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The injured man&#39;s buddies pulled out guns and fired aimlessly, while my men responded with shots of their own. Dashing through the chaos, I went to Kenya, uncertain if she was alive. Her assailant groaned in pain on the floor, as I lowered beside Kenya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood pooled around her head. My fingers searched for a pulse and after successfully finding it, I instantly carried her in my arms, proceeding out the door. The sound of Kenya momentarily saying my name was a ray of hope for me amidst that chaos. And with that encouragement, I ordered we be rushed to the hospital, immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ripping a piece of my shirt, I wrapped it around her head, managing to stall the bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, the doctors revealed to me the enormity of her head wound and steps required for her survival. I immediately gave the go ahead for her surgical procedure to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her there on the bed, hours after the surgery, the fall and rise of her chest, my only assurance of any life in her, apart from the beeping machines, was torture. The state of her health, so uncertain. Her head was wrapped up in a bandage. Little scratches all over her arms. It was a miracle she survived. I died a million times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Present day...***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I watched the entire procedure of your surgery in the observation room. And I swear I had died every moment, seeing all that blood coming from you. Seeing the laser sealing your skin. I died, Kenya&#34; I faced her, grimly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw the look in my eyes and grew frightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know that you would survive Kenya. It was a fifty-fifty chance There was never a fire or burglary. My men set the fire up on my orders, to clean the place.&#34; I paused, catching my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As for handling Hank, it was easy. I only made a few calls, set them up a little.&#34; A dark chuckle escaped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes focused on the water, as I recalled how I got Hank and his buddies well tended to by my medical team. Their wounds all healed as they dreadfully awaited their fate for weeks. Begging for death, they had been granted their wishes. A dark thrill still coursed through me, at the images of their bodies mangled by the bullets to the point of no recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling her arms around her, she shifted her gaze away. A silence thickened, my words sinking in. The water lapped white foam, touching our bare feet, kissing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now you know all that happened. Tell me, what would you have done if you had been in my shoes?&#34; My voice broke the lingering silence. A steady gaze at her. &#34;Would you have let your assailants live, or die?&#34; My words, a soft caress. I waited for her response. What did she think? Did she still find me guilty, I wondered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have done the same.&#34;</p>
