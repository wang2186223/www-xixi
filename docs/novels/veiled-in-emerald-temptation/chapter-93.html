                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Present day, a week later***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Monday. A whole seven days since Levi got me the Coupe SUV. Still unbelievable!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the salesmen had quoted the price and he had just silently given them a check, I had protested. Screaming inside at the outrageousness of buying me a car, when he had a fleet of cars. But he had kissed away my doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight as we sat, celebrating Amanda&#39;s 26th birthday, in their Beverly Hills home, I smiled. Happiness distracting me. Levi&#39;s fingers laced inside mine, while he listened to Alan&#39;s friend. We were all dressed casually. A simple out door LA party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner over and we had our drinks in hand, talking. Alfred, a friend to Amanda and Alan said a joke about Amanda&#39;s love for her husband, kids and jewelry, earning our laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mum watched us with such adoration as she equally sat. I could imagine her thoughts; her girls all grown up with their own families. I guess she did alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came with a friend tonight. A Mr Copa. Former owner of a toy shop, before he retired; giving his sons the business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya, so when are we hearing baby cries?&#34; Amanda&#39;s friend, Cassidy teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed nervously, catching Levi&#39;s eyes. He squeezed my fingers beneath the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alan invited us a few days ago to Amanda&#39;s birthday party, I had tried to escape the event, because Amanda&#39;s friends always made me nervous. Somehow tonight, I didn&#39;t want to feel intimidated by them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When Kenya is ready, we will have a baby.&#34; Levi saved me, holding my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words caressed me. A promise. I saw a gleam in his eyes and my heart sang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Ken, are we all invited to the reopening of your school?&#34; Cassidy jumped to another question. I frowned, trying to gather my thoughts that had already strewn off to Levi. My delectable distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YeahI&#39;d have my P.A send out invitations to you. I actually had no idea you&#39;d be interested in stuff like that.&#34; I stared at Cassidy, smiling. She chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a party Ken. My weakness. Right baby?&#34; She turned to Carl, her husband. The man just kissed her in the neck, earning more giggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at mum and Mr Copa, their heads lowered, sharing their own world of whispers. She had waited, sacrificed years of her life for us, until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her little moment of joy right now, was a bliss to me. I turned and saw Amanda equally watching her. Perhaps we weren&#39;t as different after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since we walked into the party, hours ago, Amanda was tensed. She masked it, but I could still see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she rose to go into the house, I followed her, careful not to attract mum&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amanda.&#34; I called, halting her on the stairs to their rooms. She turned, smiling nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What you doing here? Shouldn&#39;t you be at the party?&#34; She asked, her eyes shifting in the direction I came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to check up on you. I noticed you were off kilter. Are you tired?&#34; I came closer, holding her. Her hands felt cold, clammy. She pulled them away. *Was she coming down with something.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am fine Ken. I just need to rest. The kids are at Alan&#39;s mum&#39;s, so I should have had tonight to rest at least.&#34; She raked a hand through her long, wavy hair extension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; I felt disappointed. *Didn&#39;t she want to see us around her?* But I didn&#39;t press. I held my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugging her, I chose not to detain her longer. Maybe it was time we called it a night and returned to our hotel. I knew when I wasn&#39;t welcomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night Amanda. I&#39;ll be leaving with Levi.&#34; I informed her. She hitched her breath. Nodding tightly. I wondered at her reaction and quietly walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to disturb her further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I walked outside. I greeted Alan and the others. Alan followed and we talked. I finalized the paper work for production of the movie, earlier today, when we arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he just gave me a reminder when I was expected to come to set. In September. It wasn&#39;t a mega role. I was just to act as this ballerina that catches the eye of an assassin. Just about four scenes for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got to the car and I leaned against it, watching the stars. I managed to ask mum to bring my old stuff from her place, when she was coming. She brought a cardboard box filled with my old stuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Levi&#39;s comforting voice came. I turned. He already had the car door open for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am just worried about my sister. She looked off.&#34; I walked to him, opening the back door and sitting down. I dragged out my diary from the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to hold on to past memories of Amanda and I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up into a woman, Amanda changed. I think before she became a woman. I think when she had to work hours for my school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi came to silently stand in front of me. I held back my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I unlocked the diary with its key and began thumbing the pages. It still smelled floral. Scents I used to spray on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that your diary?&#34; Levi asked, calmly. I nodded. The surrounding security lights, filtered in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I see it?&#34; He asked me. I looked into his eyes. Tears, blurring my vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just one, for now.&#34; I informed him, pushing back the tears. But they just leaked. He didn&#39;t ask about the tears, he only nodded. I was grateful he let me cry. When I opened the page marked &#39;My Dear Future Husband,&#39; I handed it over. He took it. His expression morphing to tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was embarrassed. I didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After like an endless moment of Levi staring down at that one page, his voice came. Thick, hoarse with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wish granted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Two words,* and I crashed into his welcoming arms.</p>
