                <p>***Kenya***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up, my throat parched as I walked downstairs to grab a drink of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was 3 am, Friday morning from the monitor, and I dreaded the amount of work I had to do later in the day. There were still dance teachers to interview and the arrangements to finish up before the reopening in three weeks; 31st August.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, pulling out a bottle of cold water from the fridge and drinking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, I recalled the text I received from Levi. Three words that spoke more than I could ever imagine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#39;I Miss You.&#39;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the time I received the text, I had been focused on my laptop&#39;s screen, working on some files that Dave sent me. I had stared at the text speechlessly for minutes. Recalling Rory&#39;s revelation earlier about Levi&#39;s feelings for me. And I had felt elation as I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#39;I miss you more.&#39;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I sent that reply, no response came. But I was satisfied, knowing I occupied his thoughts, just as he did mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory had felt sorry for revealing the depth of his own feelings. And he had even indicated his intention to resign from the job, if it was too awkward seeing him as Levi&#39;s employee. But I had protested. Reminding him of our friendship. He had given me a surprised look. Contemplating my words. And had finally accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked in the direction of the stairs, the pent house quiet, except for the beeping appliances. A pair of familiar strong warm hands enveloped my waist, startling me and pulling me closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His scent filled me. His warmth passed through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi&#34; I breathed. He groaned. I leaned in closer, thinking If this was a dream, I didn&#39;t wish to miss a moment. Only that it didn&#39;t feel like it. I felt the familiar sweet ache inside my legs as he nipped my neck. I felt his erection behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your moan tells me how much you missed me.&#34; Levi exhaled into my ears. His breath warm. I wasn&#39;t dreaming. I turned to him, smiling. Relieved that he was finally home. Under the soft light, I saw his wet, bare chest. His hair was wet and he was in sweat slacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement thrilled me at the mare sight of him half dressed. I tried to form coherent words, but they died in my tongue. He leaned in, kissing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you?&#34; He smelled so nice, like a fresh shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did you come in? I didn&#39;t hear you?&#34; I asked, trying to steady my mushy nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A few minutes ago. I had some pending work that I hastily attended to in my office before I rushed in for a shower. Didn&#39;t want to bring in the day&#39;s filth into our bed.&#34; He growled, kissing me again. I liked that he had a fresh shower. I liked that he thought of me before showering. I kissed him, raising myself on tip toes, for more contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enveloping me in his arms, Levi picked me, deepening the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon we were all kisses and touches. Our bodies not having enough. The persistence of our kisses, triggering sensations in me that I wished to explore. I wrapped my legs around him, pressing my sex into. He growled, carrying me upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let Levi lead. He lay me on the bed, our bodies all tangled in a web of limbs. Tentative kisses caressed my body, my heart beating fast. I was wearing a beige lingerie, by breasts all aching for him. He didn&#39;t disappoint. Knowing what my body craved, he climbed into bed, burying himself in my breasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moaned, our sounds of pleasure, filling the quiet that surrounded me earlier. Levi didn&#39;t hurry his pace this time. He worshipped me. I was his muse that he wished to carve out in the strokes of pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands tugged my lacy lingerie, and I complied, helping him take it off. Slipping my hands into his waistband, I pressed his buttocks, until his arousal prodded me painfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you.&#34; I whispered, impatiently. His gaze was tender. His expression filled with adoration, affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have me,&#34; he whispered back and wasted no time taking down his slacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon we lay in bed naked and he slowed, caressing me, watching me. He didn&#39;t invade me, he only watched me. His body in-between my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tonight I want to watch you, while I make love to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twelve words. Twelve words that just sliced through me. Carving a place in my heart. My breath hitched because I didn&#39;t want to ruin the moment by making any sudden movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at me, as if he awaited my validation or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you saying?&#34; I asked, quietly. My eyes pooled in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That familiar boyish smile again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kissing my tears away, he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am saying that I yield Kenya. To the rhythm of your heart, the pace at which you have decided to set this relationship. I am saying that I am your pliant slave. I wouldn&#39;t fight this anymore. Just&#34; He hesitated, his eyes shut tight for a second. *Had he been resisting this all along? Subjected himself to blame. Even condemned souls deserved a chance.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he opened his eyes again, a shadow appeared and he struggled to banish it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just let me go at my own pace.&#34; His plea broke me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the plea of a troubled soul, locked in the captivity of his own horrors. And I yearned to reach him. Assuage his pain, his suffering. But I could only do that if he was willing. And this was willingness enough for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dispelled the selfish disappointment that crawled in. Nodding, I kissed him. And he breathed into me, pressing himself deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Filling my entrance with his erection, Levi penetrated me with his hard cock. Our bodies, our souls, syncing to Levi&#39;s slow, gentle thrusts. He watched me all through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body disintegrating under his heated gaze.</p>
