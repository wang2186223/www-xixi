                <p>The meeting finally finished. My absent mind perused the files that my secretary presented before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head nodding to almost everything she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir? Are you sure you&#39;re approving demolition of that building? You said so yourself, it&#39;s an architectural wonder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her alarmed voice jolted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A 19th century building in Louisiana that I was asked to renovate by the municipality, for use as a museum. It used to be owned by one of the richest Creole families, back in the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was distracted. Barely made any contributions during the meeting. I only grunted my response, most of the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you leave me with these until tomorrow, Renee. I&#39;d go through them.&#34; I informed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I really wanted to say was, &#39;*I&#39;ve ruined my home Renee! I&#39;ve no fucking way of fixing it.&#39;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me, concerned, before she nodded and left. Leaving the files.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the walls of my office, everything closing in on me. Even this spacious office suddenly seemed hundred sizes too small. My phone blared from an incoming message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Albert Bethel: Hey man. Am in town. Catch up at Possess?***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the phone for several seconds. I had no idea he was around. He was rarely around, with his secret life. And his business affairs that took him all over the world. Hadn&#39;t seen him in months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Sure. Be there in a flash.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least someone to lift my spirits. Welcoming the distraction, I left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fifteen minutes later, I was strolling into the interior of Possess Club and Casino, New York.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Albert and I had convinced Liam to open a joint in New York, when New York had requested an outlet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like the other Possess outlets, well furnished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a Monday evening at 7:50pm, the bar well attended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I located Albert in his VIP booth. He was alone, absently watching a lone stripper as she danced on stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey man.&#34; I greeted as I sank into the seat across from him. He regarded me, studiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look like crap,&#34; Albert said coolly. &#34;For a man, who married recently, that is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was teasing. He had the weirdest sense of humor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I broke into a smile. &#34;Good to see you too. You sort of missed the reception, so you&#39;re not one to talk.&#34; I teased back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And like that we sank into our usual ease with eachother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Albert Bethel, businessman, Ex-Navy Seal. A social recluse; still remained my closest friend after all these years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had drifted apart, when my father died, and a year later, his father shipped him off to the Navy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had kept in touch for a year. Both of us, lost in a world our fathers had carved out for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then one day, he went quiet. Ignored my calls, messages. Zoned out on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had seen it as it was; effects from pressures of the real world and I had allowed him. Swamped by my own pressures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had given up hope on ever seeing him, knowing our paths became different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then when I turned twenty five, a man who called himself Albert, but didn&#39;t as hell look like Albert, strolled into my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A different man, when I saw him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had on dark leather gloves in the month of July. Spotted a small pony tail and a sun kissed skin. Only when I looked into his eyes, I recognized Albert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep, ocean blue orbs, like his late mother&#39;s. But behind those eyes, the Albert I knew was gone. Just like me. Our bodies replaced by dark souls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s your wife?&#34; Albert asked, after we had caught up with lost times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just returned from a business trip in Italy, but he didn&#39;t elaborate further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I futilely tried on a peaceful expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s fine.&#34; My words came out clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was reluctant to talk about her, about us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang in my pocket and I picked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda Preston.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I puzzled as I answered. &#34;Hi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had grabbed her number from Kenya to call her on her birthday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LeLeviPleaseI&#39;ve been calling Kenya for minutes now and she isn&#39;t picking up. Just now, her number went straight to voice mail. Am worried about her. She didn&#39;t look good before she left.&#34; Amanda panicked. I panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened? When did you last hear from her?&#34; I asked, worriedly. Rising to my feet. Albert equally did the same, watching me concernedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like an hour ago. II told her about us, years ago&#34; She cried. *Us*? I grew confused. &#34;How we had met at a club, when I was 18 and you hadyou hadOh God how do I say this?&#34; She broke down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was confused. *Us?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; I asked her, already rushing out. Albert was close behind. &#34;What do you mean us?&#34; I needed to know where Amanda was. It would help me trace Kenya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was the girl you had refused to sleep with, years ago at a whore house. The one who had been a virgin,&#34; she said. I couldn&#39;t remember her. I couldn&#39;t comprehend anything at the moment. Right now, I was concerned about my wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apollos.&#34; Amanda&#39;s voice came. I halted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*You*?&#34; I asked, dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories tangled with that name rolled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Apollos*, the strangest name I had ever heard for a pleasure girl. I remembered the masked girl that I had talked to. That had listened to me. I remembered her voice, when she had asked me to take her. And I had refused. Choosing to taste her instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*GodYou&#39;re Apollos?*&#34; I muttered into the phone. This was bad. *Kenya*. I felt sick. &#34;Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mountain Crest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to relax. &#34;I&#39;d let you know when I find her. Get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An incoming call slipped in, just as I was hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have until 12 am, to inform the nation on Seven Forty-five news, that you&#39;re withdrawing from the elections, or your wife dies.&#34;</p>
