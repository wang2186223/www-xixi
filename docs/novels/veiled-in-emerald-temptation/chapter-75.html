                <p>Loud music reverberated through the halls as we walked into the club. Bright techno lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This entire floor dedicated to VIP customers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Possess club and Casino, was a tall, multi-story building situated on Miami Beach. Levi informed me that the majestic building was constructed by his company, a few years ago. I felt pride at the revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was dressed in black broad soled heels, black lacy, mono sleeved jumpsuit. It showed my bare legs and arms. My ears had on diamond earrings. My hair, silk pressed. Dropping below my shoulders. Levi said we had to dress expensive; club&#39;s dress code.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked extremely handsome as well. His hair shining, tussled. Top buttons of his shirt, open to expose some skin. I swallod, tempted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A door slid open and we walked into a huge hall, filled with lavishly dressed attendees, in plush seats. The lighting, soft, erotic. It was like walking into a private show room. I gawked as my eyes swept round the room. There were tables attached to all the seats and women in expensive lingerie, their faces masked, pole danced on all the tables. The eyes of the guests lazily watched the dancers perform.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thighs clenched at the lewdness. I stared as we walked further. They didn&#39;t even mind the stares, they just danced. Deftly expressing their emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do they get embarrassed?&#34; I asked. Levi&#39;s gaze studied me, as we finally sat at a table with Ruthfords&#39; on it. He helped me to my sit, a waiter coming to take our orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked to a dancer. &#34;They&#39;re paid handsomely.&#34; He tilted his head at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t even explain how I felt. I didn&#39;t know if it was right that the women worked this kind of jobs. I had no idea what I thought. A few months ago, I would have had an answer. But ever since my marriage to Levi, it was like all reason abandoned me. The world no longer black and white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re uncomfortable we can just see Liam and leave.&#34; Levi considerately suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him. My eyes caught sight of a girl already approaching us. Our dancer for the night. I swallowed. She was dressed in bejeweled lingerie, her mask equally jeweled. Her jeweled heels clicked as she mounted the steps. Her skin the same hue as mine, shining under the soft light. Her exotic scent, intoxicating. Levi held his hand in midair, halting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just say the word Kenya. Your sensibility matters to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated. My eyes shifting to the shining pole and I recalled the night he asked me to pole dance for him. Intrigue suddenly banished my hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine Levi. I want to watch.&#34; My voice was soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi nodded his head and the dancer commenced with her dancing. Her fluid movement caught my eyes and I just got lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d be right back.&#34; Levi kissed me. &#34;I got to answer this call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely registered a word he said, because I was so entranced by the beautiful dancer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her movements, expertly delivered, as she leaped on the pole. Her body language, clear, as she displayed her inner emotions. Seduction. I wondered if I could seduce Levi like that. She wasn&#39;t hesitant or shy. She was bold and I admired that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tempted to touch. To feel her skin; her long legs hugging those heels. Even her hips, swayed seductively. The bass, booming across the speakers. Was I *wrong in being tempted to touch her. Did that make me lustful?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One would think you wish to climb the pole and dance.&#34; I heard a rich voice say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned sharply. A very tall, handsome man, stood by my side. Chiseled. He had blonde hair, cropped and tussled, on his head. His face, clean shaven and he wore white long sleeved shirt and black slacks. Beside him was a waiter, who dropped a bottle of wine and three glasses on our table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes assessed him. He looked the same height as Levi. I flushed from being caught staring so profoundly at the dancer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t wish to dance on the pole.&#34; I lied*. I really wished to dance for my husband on the pole.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man grinned, seductively and lazily. He sat beside me, equally watching the dancer. I took the opportunity to gaze at his profile. His face had very fine features. His eyes gleamed, under the light. I couldn&#39;t really discern their color, but they stared intensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She dances beautifully, doesn&#39;t she?&#34; He remarked, his eyes burning me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hastily averted my gaze, upset that he caught me staring. It was awkward, staring at another man that wasn&#39;t Levi. It made me feel awful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flicked a gaze to the man and saw he watched me from his scrutinizing gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked my husband if they feel embarrassed dancing like this. But he told me they are handsomely paid.&#34; I smiled, nervously. The man&#39;s gaze was blank as he watched me. Then he moved his gaze to the dancer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are.&#34; He drawled. He wasn&#39;t in a hurry. I watched his lips. They were alluring. Perfectly fitted for his face. &#34;And they enjoy their work. Each one of these dancers, has a wealthy patron that caters for her wellbeing.&#34; He smirked. A devilish gleam in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the women in a new light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have lawyers for them. They pay taxes as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the dancer before us. I wondered if Levi was one of their patrons. If he had a girl he catered for, since he seemed familiar with the owner of the establishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am curious. My husband seems to know the owner of the place. Could he have had a girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Silence*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He did. Two lil freaks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I faltered, confused. &#34;Lil freaks? HHow did you know?&#34; I asked, bewildered. At the same time, affronted, jealous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I am the owner of the place. Liam Copeland at your service.&#34;</p>
