                <p>It was Thursday and we were at La Chère, celebrating Hank&#39;s 25th birthday. Our friends were present, making small talk, while my heart bled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could tell Andrea saw deep inside my gaze. She regarded me, suspiciously. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t offer her any validation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bruise around my left eye, marks on my right knuckles. Andrea understood. I saw questions in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So baby, tell them how we&#39;ve planned to make love all night for my birthday.&#34; Hank shamelessly revealed.  I flushed. Embarrassed. All eyes turned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My friends knew I was a very private person. Seeing Hank say such surprised them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to use the ladies.&#34; I called out, hastily. Heading for the washroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, I shut the door. I stared at myself in the mirror; tears blurring my vision, as I saw the woman I had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frightened. Beaten, most days. Other days, I wished I hadn&#39;t started this relationship in the first place. I wished I hadn&#39;t gone to apologize to him, weeks ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hank was killing me slowly from inside. If he wasn&#39;t hitting me for refusing to have sex. He was shoving me violently for contradicting his words. I was being tortured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These recent injuries, were from three days ago, when he came to my place. We argued over me refusing sex again in our relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all the kisses and foreplay, he had wanted to go further and I had refused. I was already doubting the relationship. I wanted out. Scared for my life, taking all these abuse from Hank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when he hit me. The slap had come as a shock. Like a flash of blinding light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first sting of the ache had come as a ripple through my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind trying to comprehend what happened and he had pushed me hard. Crashing me into my glass coffee table. I could barely hear a thing more after that. Shooting pain tore through my entire body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t gone to the hospital, because he had been scared of the cops. I had complied, crying silently. He had tended the wounds by himself. His tenderness, a vivid contrast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you still with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jerked in the direction of Andrea&#39;s voice. She assessed me silently. Sympathy in her eyes as she looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then who would date me?&#34; I threw back, subtly. She came closer and held my shoulders. Tears pooling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any other man, Kenya. But not him. You are a beautiful girl. Talented, witty. Any man would be lucky to have you. You don&#39;t need this. Look at what he has done to you.&#34; Her gaze raked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has turned you into a spineless woman. Stand up for yourself Kenya. Don&#39;t let him do this to you.&#34; She grew quieter now. Her eyes leaking tears. Sorrow in them. &#34;It isn&#39;t worth it. I watched my mum suffer this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ears heard the warning. My eyes saw the horror in Andy&#39;s eyes. But my heart said something else. My heart embraced the joy of sharing a label with a man. Even though I was aware the danger this man posed for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like a moth purposely flying to a flame, accepting all the consequences of the fatal attraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang in my pocket and I picked it up. Hank. I panicked. I needed to get away tonight. At least just for tonight. Tomorrow, any other day, I would be ready to fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Andy.&#34; I called, desperately. &#34;Can I crash at your place tonight? II don&#39;t have the strength to fight him. Not yet. But I am sure I&#39;d find it along the way.&#34; My eyes held my desperation. She regarded me with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s no problem, babes. But do you want me to tell Rory and Mike, so they&#39;d just handle this fucker, once and for all?&#34; She asked, worriedly. I shook my head. I wasn&#39;t yet ready to be alone again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For most of my life, I had suffered the lack of men&#39;s affections. I had yearned to be treated like any other normal girl. Wished for a man to look at me the way Hank looked at me, sometimes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not tonight, Andy. Maybe when am a bit mentally prepared for what accompanies my separation from him,&#34; I said, weakly. She let her eyes linger on me, a moment, before she nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt relieved that I wouldn&#39;t have to spend the night with him and have us fight again over sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To me, sex was a sacred bond. An act to be shared between two, longing souls. A picture of passion, etched out on the rhythmic waves of desire. And with Hank, there was no passion. No desire. Only a crazed hunger in his eyes, whenever he looked at me. A crazed look that revolted me, rather than aroused me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After helping me clean up, we strolled to meet the others, who were each engrossed in their own phones. Hank wasn&#39;t in amicability with any of my friends. He usually described them as snobs. They on the other hand tried to find a common ground with him for my sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Hank. Kenya isn&#39;t feeling too good. She&#39;s coming with,&#34; Andrea boldly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hank raised his eyes from his phone, shifting to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed his face and I recognized it. He was upset. I inwardly faltered. My legs shaking. I was almost going against Andrea&#39;s words, when I felt a hand slip into mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle squeeze and I instantly knew it was Andy, reassuring me. Telling me just for tonight, I needed to think of me. To take care of me. Then tomorrow, I would decide what I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inhaling a shaky breath, I spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Hank. I&#39;m sorry but I have to take care of myself. I don&#39;t really feel too good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded without compassion.</p>
