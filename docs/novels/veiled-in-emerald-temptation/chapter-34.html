                <p>The Ruthford estate, one of the luxury estates situated in the Hudson Coast; a 200 acres of land, boasting grand estates owned by Macklesfield Businesses Inc., was a large expanse of deluxe greenery. Rich shelter of tall, old evergreen trees and shrubs, greeted us as we glided in through the gates. It was a magnificent estate, reminiscent of a gilded architecture that once existed in 19th century America. The atmosphere, breathtaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was born here. Lived and grew up here for years, until I was 15 and dad died. Leaving Mum and I on the streets. With no qualifications, money, and family, we had been forced to live in the best place Mum could afford with her little savings. Hell&#39;s kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hudson river is just inside those trees.&#34; I remarked, distracting those unpleasant memories with Kenya&#39;s fascination with the place. Watching her, I was pleased and smiled with relief. I had been holding my breath in anticipation of how she&#39;d take my childhood home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat so close to each other all morning, from the plane to this car ride. Divided by silence and I hated it. Nothing hurt more than the knowledge that I had ruined our once peaceful interaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I told her earlier that we were heading to Irvington, she had worn an unmasked excitement. And I had wondered if she had never seen the place, her entire years being an American. I wanted to take her on a tour around as soon as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her travel her gaze around the surrounding as we stepped out of the car, I was happy to have finally given her joy again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How were you able to regain the Ruthford family mansion.&#34; She breathed through her haze of adoration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That took me by surprise. I froze. My mind reeling years back. Years I&#39;d rather forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause, one which I pondered how much I needed to reveal to her. It seemed my silence alerted her to my hesitation and she turned to me. Cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to tell me. I can guess&#34; She muttered. Around us, staff had already come out to carry in our bags. The sounds of feet crunching on the gravel, not easing the tension. Another black SUV pulled up beside us and Blake along with three of my men all cladded in black suits, alighted the vehicle. Blake sensed the tension between us and excused himself, seeing to the organization of things inside. I watched everything silently. My mask of calm cracking under her gaze. Did she judge me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heaving a heavy sigh, I closed the space us. My voice dropped to a low timbre as I stood before her. She was dressed in a simple blue, lace blouse, tucked into white jeans. Broad soled nude colored sandals, graced her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Ruthford mansion, like every mansion here, was possessed years ago, by the Macklefields.&#34; My voice, cracked with emotions. Our gazes locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They had purchased all these impoverished family owned estates, turning them into their monumental collection. Every estate here was once owned by a reputable American family. Homes lost to liquidation. When I was able to&#34; I paused. My tone grave. &#34;I purchased the home back from Macklesfield businesses Inc., after a few years. That&#39;s all you need to know.&#34; I stated, sternly. My words echoed nothing compared to what my heart screamed. Because I had gone to hell and back, raising the millions needed to restore my family honor, years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Ruthford, the president is on line one.&#34; Blake broke the crackling silence, filled with unanswered questions. Relief washed over me at the timely interruption. Nodding my head, I turned around and walked in the direction of the house. My heart breaking at the hidden truths that stood between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Kenya***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He isn&#39;t a bad man, Mrs Ruthford.&#34; I heard Blake, beside me. Startling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned a wary gaze to him, my anger roiling at the formality. I was certain Levi had insisted upon it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He isn&#39;t?&#34; I sneered, my eyes boring into Blake. &#34;He stole my life from underneath my feet, Blake.&#34; I grumbled, my heart ripping in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, didn&#39;t he insist you remained formal with me?&#34; I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake lowered his eyes briefly, before he contritely focused them on me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am bound by an oath to uphold everything Levi says, Mrs Ruthford. Ours is more than employer-employee relationship. It&#39;s rooted deeper than that.&#34; Blake revealed. I parted my lips to speak, but failed. The depth of emotion I saw in his expression, unnerving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How deep?&#34; I curiously asked, watching him. I needed to know this life I had fallen into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A life for a life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I startled at that declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying nothing more, Blake walked in the direction of the house, his words, slicing through the entire ambience of the surrounding that greeted me earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding to dispel the words, their implication and my simmering rage, I took a walk in the direction of the river, following Levi&#39;s directives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed the neat walkway, the smell of the river already greeting me and arrived at my destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peace greeted me. A smile of genuine adoration lit my face. My body easing to the comfort I saw. I sat on the lone bench, the spot cool, sheltered by old, tall, beautiful trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lush, green lawn, caressed the bank of the river, evoking earthy tones. The wind, inducing the smell of mud and wetness, the smell of a preserved earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the flowing water, rushing before my eyes, aroused a sense of freedom that I craved. Rushing without inhibition. I envied it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no debris hindering its flow. It just rushed around the bend, flowing with life. Just like I once did. Now, all that was lost. Interrupted by my very handsome debris, Levi. A man I tremendously craved, day and night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched the quiet scene, tears flowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A life for a life.&#34; I echoed, quietly.</p>
