                <p>&#34;That night you rescued me from the fire, what happened?&#34; I asked, shakily. This restaurant was beautiful and intimate. I had never visited it before. Actually, I had a non-existent social life due to my disability. He seemed distracted as his eyes gazed at me. I repeated the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I have asked you this many times in the last weeks. But I can&#39;t shake these images that keep flashing in my memory. Especially today when I heard of Hank,&#34; I explained. I reached for my glass of the expensive red wine, sipping generously. *God! He made me nervous, especially with the look of displeasure in his eyes.* Levi suddenly grew cold, detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave us, please,&#34; Levi said to the waiters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Filing out of the room, the waiters left us alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have I made you angry?&#34; I asked, anxiously. He watched me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you haven&#39;t,&#34; he confessed tenderly, sipping some wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am really sorry. It&#39;s just that I am shocked that Hank was caught dead in a gang war. I never knew he was in a gang He wasn&#39;t that kind of person.&#34; I rattled, nervously. Levi smiled sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you love him that much?&#34; Again with this question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NoI didn&#39;t, Mr Ruthford. Am just&#34; I trailed off. He frowned, watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for my hand, he pulled me up, holding my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tonight is all about your successful call to be the belle of the show,&#34; Levi said quietly. I shook as his fingers climbed my upper arms. His touch singed me through my sleeves. I grew weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wounding his arms around the small of my back, a little pressure of his fingers, he swayed us into a dance. His nearness, mesmerizing, his earthy- bergamot cologne, intoxicating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, he lowered his lips and pressed them to mine. Soft, tender, like water to a steaming skillet. I gasped at this most yearned contact. But soon, a deep need filled us, the kiss increasing. Bites. Nibbles. Hesitant kisses, trailed down the line of my jaw. A fire ignited in me, rippling through, until it pooled in my loins. My nipples, puckered. I moaned. I didn&#39;t recognize my own voice. Growing impatient, I touched him, clumsily. He gave a throaty groan. My head spinning. This was different for me. I liked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our bodies pressed, so tightly, we barely breathed, as he deepened the kiss. Tongues, lips, entangled. His caresses, burned. He lifted me from the ground, my legs wrapped round his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if someone comes in?&#34; I gasped, pulling away from the heated kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one would, because I asked for privacy. If we need them, there is a button under the table, I can press.&#34; Levi assured me, a dark smile and a kiss to my mouth, accompanying his heated gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Levi asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you come here often with?&#34; I flustered, unable to finish the words. I was jealous. Wow! Somehow, I didn&#39;t want to share him with any other woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I often eat in this room, when I want privacy&#34; He chuckled, amused at my expense. He kissed me m. &#34;But, you are the first woman I have brought up here&#34; Another kiss. I looked into his eyes, searching for something I couldn&#39;t discern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me emphasize my point&#34; He lowered his lips to deeply kiss me, placing me on the table. We moaned, thrills surging through us. I parted my legs, and he pressed closer, intensifying the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering the top of my dress, he feasted on my bare, twin mounds. His mouth, wet and warm, sucked my nipples. Each nipple, considerably attended to. He gently stroked my legs, his fingers inching upwards, until he reached my panties. Laying me flat on the table, Levi whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared, confused. &#34;For what?&#34; I managed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For this&#34; He bunched my dress around my waist, further parting me. Lowering himself to his knees, Levi leaned into the apex of my thighs. In one deft, unexpected move, he pulled me closer and kissed my already wet pussy, through my panties. I flushed in embarrassment and writhed in pleasure. My body arched into him, my moan deep. He pressed his lips closer, spreading my folds through my panties and latched his tongue to my clit. I grabbed his hair, my ache, palpable. My body was engorged in flames. I writhed and rocked my hips. And he wasn&#39;t even finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say my name...&#34; I heard him say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; I croaked. And then it happened. A coolness spread through me, as Levi shifted my panties. Softly, he licked my already wet center, his name a plea, escaping my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi...&#34; I cried, my body inflamed. A sweet pain ignited in my center. He latched onto my clit, drinking me in. I felt all the colors of mortification. Yet, I relished it. My legs, wantonly spread, pliant as he licked me in strokes and circles. My hips buckled into him, he continued to deliver licks and strokes. Pinching one of my nipples, he continued to suck me. Pleasurable ache, swirling inside me. Tearing through me in exhilarating pain, from the point where his mouth clenched my clit. I couldn&#39;t bear it. Tortured, I writhed, scraping my fingers against his arms. I gasped and mewled, my racking body, causing him to smile beneath my hot, wet, pussy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt him reach a finger into my already wet sheath and a searing pain, tore through me. My body, quivered in sheer agony. My insides, pained. Levi pulled his finger out of me immediately, standing somewhere in the periphery of my vision. I grew frightened, shaky, as I tried to pull myself together. It was normal, I had expected it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our eyes locked, shock visibly expressed on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are youAre you a va virgin?&#34; His alarm, confusion, remorse and shock, explicit, as I stared into his handsome face. Those beautiful eyes, suddenly filled with sorrow or pitysomething indiscernible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Covering myself up, I sat upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Levi. I am.&#34;</p>
