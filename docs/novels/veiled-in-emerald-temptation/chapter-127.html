                <p>***Levi.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Present day, two days later***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was warm enough for her, considering the fever she had suffered, since two nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was October 5th and I knew what that entailed for me in regard to the threat from BB. To step down before Monday the 7th. Still I didn&#39;t give a fuck. My home was breaking. And I couldn&#39;t stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t meant to show Kenya my true form. I had struggled to keep that part of me hidden from her all this time. But something in me shattered, the moment I watched those surveillance pictures of Kenya and the late doctor. All cozy, sweet. I had received intel that they had attended high school together and that had made matters worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The death of Alec Cruso was all over the news and I had commiserated with the family, being close business allies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wouldn&#39;t have died, if he hadn&#39;t trodden on marked territory. Such was the rule and he had failed. Now his entire family and my wife suffered the consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My doctors attributed her fever to shock and fatigue. And I ordered she had the best treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her soul was refusing to heal and I feared the worst for our child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Our child.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like a drops of honey on my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*We made a baby.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart suddenly grew warm, thinking of Kenya popping out a sweet bundle that looked like us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t been given a chance for a proper family with Belle. And now I had this chance, I wasn&#39;t smoking it for the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her IV went smoothly, while I silently watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments later, Kenya stirred, my knees almost buckling in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pried her eyes open and the instant we locked gazes, she gasped. Eyes wide. She whimpered and I couldn&#39;t even begin to regret my actions nights ago. The look on her face, crushed me. She had seen the monster in me, and now she hated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t hurt you. I only wanted to ensure you&#39;re alright.&#34; I hastily explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice, calm, my expression contrite, I felt guilt at hurting her. But it was a hurt that couldn&#39;t have been avoided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silent, she only lay there, watching me warily. Her lips parched. Her eyes hollow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The substances that had been administered to her hadn&#39;t affected her nor the baby. I had one of the best female gynecologists currently on standby in the Ruthford estate, in case she had any complications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had reached an impasse in our relationship with the wrong decisions recently made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She, choosing to harbor thoughts of having other men. Me, unable to withstand the thoughts of sharing her with another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, we had reached a break point. And I wasn&#39;t sure we could ever return from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had crossed the line in my fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hate in her eyes, unbearable, I spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am leaving you here in the Ruthford mansion. I wouldn&#39;t disturb you, until the baby is born. It is only then; I would make arrangements to visit the child often. There would be no divorce, but we will go on with our lives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flinched, or was it my imagination. Perhaps I wanted her to protest my choice. Unfortunately, she said nothing. Only her haunted gaze, spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving her one last look, before I disappeared from her life forever, I rose and crossed the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers closed around the doorknob and her voice halted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t sleep with Alec.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to turn back. But her weak voice pulled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing her now, she continued. Tears rolling, as she sat upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That night he came, we kissed. And I had stopped him, when I realized I really loved the idea of a family with you. I had put aside my anger for you and focused on having the baby with you. I had told him all about it and he had listened. Somehow, we had fallen asleep. But I never cheated on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cried, softly. My chest constricted at her confession. I hadn&#39;t cried in 20 years, since mum&#39;s death. And this woman was wielding my heart again with her powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And K.C. I didn&#39;t see him that night I touched myself.&#34; She continued. I looked at her, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw you. I came for you. But I couldn&#39;t say the words to K.C, because I hadn&#39;t wanted to appear weak. I haven&#39;t seen another man, ever since I saw you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I saw you.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stilled. My tongue heavy. A tight knot that used to be rooted in the depths of my soul, loosened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what was left was a bundle of frayed nerves, too ruined to find solace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words rang in my ears. Seeking the fortresses of my heart. Breaking the ice, until only puddle remained. A pool of despair. Of regret. Of years of resentment against love. Against emotions. Against weakness, which had ruled me for years, since I fell into the shadow world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to speak. Counter her claim. But I couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No flaw in her confession. Only the heart of the listener, that got destroyed by grief and suffering, years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, it was like there was a need to awaken. To find a center. To climb down the pinnacle of the anguish and hate that had swamped me for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As soon as the baby is born, I would send word. Preferably, send your minions to keep an eye on me.&#34; Kenya&#39;s tone was resigned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her initial hurt, replaced by a malicious hatred. I allowed my gaze linger. My emotions warring within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night, Levi. Don&#39;t worry, I would keep to your terms.&#34; She gave me one last look, before she lowered herself in the bed. Shifting to her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I compelled my legs out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her muffled sobs, reached my ears as I shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And perhaps shutting her love, forever.</p>
