                <p>***Present day, A week later***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi. We&#39;ve decoded the man&#39;s phone. He lied when he informed you that they had no links with the contact and BB.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listened to Blake. We sat in the office of my private cabin at 8 pm in the evening, as he showed me all the information on his tablet. A cigarette lazily burned between my fingers as I took all the information in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that man in Miami had been lying. I had smelled it and that was the reason I had killed him. Because he had been wasting my time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The contact is Cyril Portman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze at the name. Dark Memories flooding in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*A man that was notorious for his sinister activities against women in the underworld*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I contemplated Blake&#39;s revelation. My heart racing as actions tied with that name flooded back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cyril Portman, AKA, Rhino, was known for his disgusting trade. I had secretly abhorred him, wanted to kill him myself, years ago. But the feds had caught him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A once convicted criminal in the States for assault, aiding and abetting in murder. He was wanted in many countries for multiple assaults and felonies. Now, his actions had invaded my tuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s his residence, lets pay him a visit.&#34; My blood boiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had seen the man in America for years. I was surprised he was making deals here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t reside here, Levi. Has lived in Bali for years since his release from jail. Owns a large villa there,&#34; Blake said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake&#39;s eyes equally held disgust. We were both familiar with the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He showed me the man&#39;s details. ID, address splayed on the screen. There was information about the next shipment, which the owner of the phone had been expected to make. Apparently, no one knew he was dead yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lure him in.&#34; I needed Portman gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had met once. Notorious. Dark, sinister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a pimp back in the day, the man had been famous for condoning brutality towards his whores. His girls went mysteriously missing, killed or maimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tina was one of his girls I had under my protection. No attachments. I had secretly tried to save her from her life as a prostitute. Somehow, word reached Cyril and the girl had disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I found out, I had gone after Cyril, my intent to take him out forever, before he harmed another girl, ending another life. But Rowan had stopped me. I had been 19 at the time and hot blooded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I had another chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want that fucker gone, Blake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Levi.&#34; Blake put away his tablet, his expression guarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you be involved in this, or&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always wanted to get back at that monster for what he had done with Tina. There hadn&#39;t been any solid evidence, as Rowan had insinuated, but I had felt it. He had gotten rid of her for his sick amusement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fury palpable as my eyes saw Tina&#39;s mangled body. She had been brutally raped. Her body butchered and burned with acid to erase all evidence. I had wept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she had been like me. Once a rich kid, unfortunate to find herself in the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake had equally held me down that night, while they carried her corpse. She had been dumped on our tuff in Queens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget you have your wife to look after now. This action might have consequences. Let&#39;s report these guys to the feds.&#34; Blake suggested, his tone wary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rose to my feet, collecting a file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They need evidence. And right now, we don&#39;t have that. So how about we handle this our way.&#34; I smiled darkly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake shook his head, resignedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am worried Levi. We both know how things ended for Tina, because you stuck your nose in Cyril&#39;s business, years ago. Don&#39;t let anything happen to Kenya. She is the best thing that has happened to you in years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard Blake&#39;s warning. I really did. It kinda pierced through. But I ignored it. Retribution called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You saw Tina&#39;s body that night, Blake. The bodies of women that Cyril has destroyed. I saw pictures of those girls, packed as sardines in those containers. People like Cyril don&#39;t deserve to live.&#34; I shot him a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw something in my eyes and knew my decision was moot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya would be fine. I&#39;d increase security for her.&#34; I concluded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake exhaled and nodded his head. Without any further argument, he exited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to pick my phone, Kenya&#39;s picture filled my screen as I highlighted it. A picture of her on our wedding. I had it since after the wedding. She had no idea I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Actually she never asked about my phone and I was grateful for that. Cause it would be awkward her seeing it. I didn&#39;t want her to conclude things that weren&#39;t there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sent her a text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Hey baby. What you doing?***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t have feelings the way she confessed she did for me. I desired her. I cared about her. *But love.* Love failed me once and it had</p>
                
                
                
                <p>damaged me. Love for my father, mum, Belle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When you loved, you were vulnerable to destruction. And at this moment in my life, I had acquired too much to be destroyed. I needed my life to remain in control. And allowing myself fall was going to do that. Reduce me to ashes. It was going to make me vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words that night at William&#39;s home in Miami, had rattled me. Shocked me shitless. I had kissed her as my best response. My virgin wife turned naughty, who thought she was in love because of her body&#39;s reactions to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a fallen angel. My words that night had disappointed her. But they were true. I needed to save her from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A message entered my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Kenya: Dripping for you. Come home to me. Meet me in the cave.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I don&#39;t deserve her*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lust stirred again.</p>
