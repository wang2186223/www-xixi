                <p>&#34;***Billionaire business man and owner of Mirage Bank, Timothy Reed, has been missing since two weeks. Family has requested that anyone who knows his whereabouts, calls the number; 775-9933 or sends an email to*** [***NKN@jmail.com***](mailto:NKN@jmail.com)***.&#34;***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finished the rest of my dinner. The television continued to rumble about the five top business men that went missing weeks ago. Timothy Reed was the last one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting away the cleaned dishes, I walked to the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am heading out mum. Have some home work to do with my friends.&#34; That was a lie. I had no friends at my new school. I was a lone wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Must you, honey?&#34; Mum asked worriedly, turning from the television. Her face pale. &#34;Meghan&#39;s father has been missing for days and the family must be devastated. The streets aren&#39;t safe at night these days, Levi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;We no longer fall in their category mum. Those are rich folks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed my jacket from the coat hanger. My face expressionless when I turned back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lock the door mum. I&#39;d be back tomorrow.&#34; I crossed to the door, turning the knob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi?&#34; Mum called. I halted, but I didn&#39;t turn back. I knew what she was going to say. She said it every night I stepped out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Must you stay over again? And that tattoo on your arm? Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart ripped in my chest, knowing that her concern was lost on me. Inhaling a shaky breath, my chest hurting at how down the road I had gone. How things had changed, I stepped out of the house without a response to her. I heard her muffled sobs through the door, but I didn&#39;t turn back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a few minutes, I joined the others in the abandoned warehouse. Rowan had asked us all to meet there. It was already quarter past eight and everyone stood, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi.&#34; He called me out of the crowd, his tone menacing. I was used to him now. I was used to everything here now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped forward and he smiled darkly. My eyes caught sight of Black Pea, who stood there eyeing me, disdainfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since that night I shot Freddy, most of the others saw me as a force to be feared. Especially as Rowan asked me for the gift I desired. The others just stood neutral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, my gift was to be unwrapped. My body was fired up in anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I asked you what you wanted in return for your loyalty, you had brought me the biggest request. You asked for retribution.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Rowan&#39;s eyes was sick darkness. It was an extension of him. One that would forever be feared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tonight, I give you reckoning!&#34; Rowan roared, his voice echoing through the warehouse. He gestured and out of a door rolled out his men dragging the five top missing business men of NYC.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Timothy Reed, Dathan Nicos, Alexis Ribber, Dweed Rivers and Steven Strad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sick excitement trailed through me, my body tingling. It was an unusual pleasure, seeing the men that had pestered my mother, deprived us of help, blindfolded, gagged and bound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Petrified, they struggled with their captors. Whimpering. No one could hear them now. Just like no one could hear us when we pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men were brought to me, like a birthday cake. They fell them on their knees before me, their heads lowered. I felt like a king. The stench of their fear, satisfactory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are your prisoners, Levi. Do the honors.&#34; Rowan ordered, quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt powerful. On top of the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hatred for these men inundated me. An inner rage undulated, giving room to a malevolence for the men kneeling before me. These same men that hadn&#39;t been there for us, when we needed them. These same men that had brandished their wealth before fallen people like me and mum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled out my switch blade, the sound of it startling one of them. I smiled darkly. Coming to stand before Timothy Reed, the stench of his fear assuaging all the ache that had lurked in my heart since dad&#39;s death; since the plummet to hell. I was appeased, seeing him tremble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking off his blindfold, I smiled sinisterly in his face. Horror stretched across his face, his eyes opened wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Timothy. Remember me?&#34; I snarled. His expression turned to confusion, a frown marring his face. He struggled, whimpering. I slid the blade along the sides of his face. He flinched from its coldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are your many men now, Timothy? Where are your millions?&#34; I asked him. There was a heavy silence across the room. The only sounds heard were the men&#39;s muffled sounds. If Timothy could speak, I could only imagine the many words that would have spewed from his mouth. But he couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared in disgust at him. He was revolting to look at, as I saw the way he had touched my mother. Heard her pleading voice, asking him not to proposition her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt sick in the stomach. My insides roiled with all the darkness. I didn&#39;t see a human before me. Only a repulsive being, unworthy of compassion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is for trying to fuck my mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sinking my knife into one of his eyes, I dug deep. Skin, sinews, nerves and vessels snapped. A sickening sound. I didn&#39;t care. He was held down for me, his anguish palpable. My fingers deep in his crimson blood, I plunged in, until I had his eye ball out. He twisted in pain on the floor and I went for the other eye. Repeating the same action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was done, I watched as Timothy limp on the floor, had his blood pooled around him. The smell of choking copper filling the entire warehouse. Stifling me. Nausea came. But I steadied myself. Knowing I had to repeat the action with the other four men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mother was going to be avenged tonight. Her honor restored.</p>
