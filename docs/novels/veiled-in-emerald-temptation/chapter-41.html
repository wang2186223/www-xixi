                <p>***Levi.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You would just walk away? That means you have no remorse for what you have done. Destroying lives.&#34; She called from behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored her, coming to a halt in the front of the bar, still in the cave. I reached for a bottle of brandy and poured two glasses. Handing one to Kenya, I took the other for me, sipping it. After taking a generous sip, I went further into the cave and sat on a seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t said a word in my defense because you are correct. I didn&#39;t think twice before I married you. The last of Belle&#39;s family, the Moores, is Benjamin. Their parents died shortly after our wedding. So I don&#39;t blame him for thinking I disrespected his sister, by marrying you. He&#39;s still hurting. But I couldn&#39;t remain single, when I found you.&#34; I fixed my gaze on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He always protested against me having any other affairs after his sister&#39;s death. I do not regret my actions.&#34; My back was to her as I sat in the plush seat. Kenya came to sit beside me, nursing the brandy in her hand. Lifting an intense gaze to her, I spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would do it all again, Kenya.&#34; I picked one of her palms and placed it on my chest, the position of my heart. &#34;All over again, just to have you. Just to save you. Taking out Hank. Forcing you into marriage. Going against the entire world. And I mean it, from here.&#34; I pressed her hand to my heart. &#34;I only ask that I am granted forgiveness for this sin. Even if&#34; There was pain inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if you don&#39;t regard me any longerEven if you&#34; I let my words hang mid-sentence. She hitched her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if what?&#34; Kenya&#39;s voice, low, pressed. Agony coursed through me, because I was aware that I had lost her. I had sacrificed too much to have Kenya. And now, I had lost her. If she knew the truth about me. She already hated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if you continue to despise me like you do. Even if I don&#39;t see that fire in your eyes for me, like you used toIt&#39;s enough that I have you. I only ask that you forgive me, someday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t despise you, Levi.&#34; She admitted, softly. I saw through her lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could have fooled me.&#34; I scoffed. &#34;I see the loathe you feel for me in your eyes, Kenya. It&#39;s deep.&#34; My thumb stroked her hand that was held in place against my heart. The contact was making my head spin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling her hand from underneath me, she put aside the cup and shifted her gaze. The air seemed thick with the emotion that had suddenly crept into the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have been invited for a welcome reception on Saturday by my party members.&#34; I informed her, interrupting the thickened air. She nodded succinctly in acknowledgement, allowing her eyes gaze around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are those ppoles?&#34; Kenya asked, astonished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed her gaze, amused as I caught sight of what had gained her attention. Four shining silver poles stood on a large stage, which was lined with black, emerald green and blood-red color themes. Seductive and exotic. Kenya couldn&#39;t take her gaze away from the view. I watched her, intrigue over her, as she climbed the stage. Amusedly, I followed her with my gaze. She trailed her hands on the floor, climbing the small stairs that led to the stage. Her hands trailed languidly along one shining pole, her eyes fascinated. I envied that pole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Haven&#39;t you seen a stripper&#39;s pole before?&#34; I asked, coming to stand beneath the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught sight of that chain wound round her thigh and desire found its way. A welcoming distraction to all the storm I felt inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen them up close before.&#34; She admitted, coyly. &#34;I have seen them in movies. And of course we have used bars at our dance studios, but&#34; She trailed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was already beside her on top the stage. Wondering if she had never visited a club. *What life had she lived prior to me*? I wore a dark look, watching her in fascination. I was a shadow in her light. A scarlet in her purity and I would do it all again, if it was to have her for a lifetime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked round a corner and turned on music. Surround speakers came alive, dripping with bass. She startled, surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why have you turned on the music?&#34; She muttered when I drew up close. So close I tasted her scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;IIwe had a very long eveningI think we should retire to bed.&#34; She suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stalked her seductively, like a predator, gauging it&#39;s harmless, prey. I touched her withy gaze. My eyes raked her hungrily. I was down to my crisp white shirt, some buttons lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to do this, Levi.&#34; She pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what?&#34; I loomed seductively over her, my voice hoarse. &#34;A friend of mine owns a club, Possess. Am flying over to Miami in two weeks. We can attend his club for Strippers&#39; Wednesday.&#34; I let my words, caress her. &#34;And you can see all these poles up close.&#34; I baited her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her gaze to me. Desire already pooled in her eyes, as she watched me with such intrigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dance for me&#34; I requested, after a moment of loaded pause. A command, subtle, yet powerful. Filled with unspoken desires. Our desires. Our bodies heated with so much promise. I needed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I don&#39;t know how to dance on the pole.&#34; She let on. I smiled, pressing her painfully to the pole, our foreheads pressed tight. My body aching for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to dance on the pole, Baby. Dance for me like you did on your debut.&#34; I requested. She inhaled a sharp breath. Suprise in her gaze. I searched her eyes. Wondering her thoughts. Wondering if she could sense my burning desire.</p>
