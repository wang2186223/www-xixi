                <p>***As a little girl, I used to dream of my wedding.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***I used to say I would get married to a handsome ballet dancer. Have lots of dancing children. I grew up and became a teenager, my dreams changed.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***I started fantasizing about marrying a surgeon. I wanted to admire my husband as he constantly saved lives. While I danced to give others happiness. Much like we will be saving lives together.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Now as a 16-year-old in 11******th*** ***grade, I don&#39;t think I have such thoughts anymore. To me marriage is just a dream for beautiful girls. Perfect girls with perfect shapes. Their limbs all in perfect symmetry. No hiccups.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Yet I can&#39;t seem to put away the desire of someday meeting my knight in shining armor. My Lancelot or King Arthur. Am not picky. I just wish that some guy someday, would look at me and truly see me and not this dastard limp.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up from my pink colored Rhine stoned diary, staring at the other students clustered around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely anyone noticed me during lunch hour. But I never bothered. I only saw me and my goal to be a perfect dancer someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned my eyes to my left and caught sight of Alec at the far corner, assessing me again with his intense blue eyes. I flushed, looking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the most handsome boy on the school&#39;s tennis team and I usually stopped myself from drooling over him. The same way I was sure every other girl drooled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no friends. I was invincible to all of them. The limping weirdo. But I didn&#39;t care. Mum said I only needed to focus on me and no one else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was the elephant in the room, she would say. However sometimes, this elephant was invincible, even to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After school, I took a bus to the library for some homework. The only thing mum and Amanda expected from me was to pass my grades and enter the best college. Get a great job thereafter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wanted to get into the Manhattan School of the Arts so bad. If I did, I would be great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a boring, unenviable life. I only had mum and my sister. I used to beg for friendships. But once I got into middle school, I stopped and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>held my dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was 5:30 Pm before I reached home. Mum was working. She worked as a hospital assistant for a big hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey sparkles.&#34; Amanda called, her hair all covered in her bonnet. Fresh from the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey. Where you off to?&#34; I eyed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hung my bag, sat on my bed, watching her. She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Work.&#34; She sat on our vanity, applying those scented lotions she loved to apply. They made her body all smooth, shining. No blemish on her skin. I envied that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her graceful poise. She walked down the streets and every man turned his eyes to her. I loved my sister. Kind, ambitious and loyal. Working endlessly after high school to help me and mum. I couldn&#39;t just continue to follow in her wake. I needed to create a life for myself. One that was uniquely me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to enroll in the Manhattan school of the Arts, Amanda.&#34; I was quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda stilled for a second, before she continued applying her lotion. She took off her bonnet, combed out her luxurious kinky curls. She loved holding them in a pair of boxer braids for work night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know how expensive that school is?&#34; Amanda asked, calmly. I nodded, even though she couldn&#39;t see me from where she sat. &#34;It&#39;s a school for rich kids, Ken. And we aren&#39;t rich.&#34; She turned to me now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared, tears pooling around my eyes at that reminder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t get inI&#39;ll work hard and get a scholarship... My grades are great.&#34; I wept. My sniffs coming hard as I tried to rein myself in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t say anything. Just stared. Tears stained her eyes as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to be me, Amanda. I can&#39;t be you. I don&#39;t have boyfriends. I don&#39;t have friends... No one wants to be close to me Amanda... When they look at me, they just see this... freak. Do you know how I had to pay a boy to kiss me? Just so I could know what it felt like to be kissed.&#34; I sobbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amanda glided to me, holding me in her arms. I broke into sobs. My heart cracking from inside. The pain I felt, the resentment I harbored just seeing myself in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If they don&#39;t see you then that&#39;s their loss, Ken.&#34; Amanda tilted my head back, looking in my eyes. I sniffed, her smile trying to reach somewhere inside me. But I resisted. She couldn&#39;t see my suffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you sometimes think I have life easy. But I don&#39;t. Sometimes I cry, when I think how life would have been if we had a dad or something. But we have us. And that&#39;s what matters. We will survive; three of us. And someday, you and I will marry reputable men, who will love us, completely.&#34; Amanda smiled. Her tears mirrored mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed a nod. Then she added, after a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, this school of Arts thing; if you get a scholarship, do you think we will be able to navigate around the fees for you?&#34; She held my gaze, waiting for me. I cracked a smile and held her in an affectionate hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you Sparkles. Never forget that.&#34; Then she rose to her feet, continuing with her dressing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she left, I sat down on my desk, smiling. I was going to attend the school. I couldn&#39;t even contain my happiness. Pulling out my diary, I started writing a letter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***&#34;Dear Future Husband,***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***I would wish for you to stay with me forever.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***xoxo***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Love,***</p>
