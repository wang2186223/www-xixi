                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***April 8th, few months earlier***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was 4pm, Monday. We were practicing for the show in May, next month at the theater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was finally selected for the show, as a backup dancer. I didn&#39;t mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Byron always loved us performing on the Manhattan stage for a show, to get us prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been four days since Hank&#39;s birthday. Four days since I moved into Andy&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t mind. Asked me to stay longer. Hank was furious at my arrangement and was weary of my excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he called yesterday and I informed him that Andrea and I needed to master our routines, he had flared. I wasn&#39;t exhausted of all the excuses I was giving him. I was ready to keep manufacturing excuses, until I found the courage to leave him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told mum and Amanda about him. Knowing mum, she asked me to leave him. Said no person deserved an absusive relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But mum was perfect and she didn&#39;t ever suffer derision from an impediment, whenever she walked the streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw it in people&#39;s eyes, and It made me miserable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hank was a safe zone for me. Someone who I felt gave me what I yearned for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finished the routine, just when Hank strolled into the theater. Surprised at seeing him, I tried to control my emotions. Dreading his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently I let him lead us backstage, since he asked we talked. I equally needed us to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind a screen door, I finished slipping into my shirt, when I felt strong arms around my waist. I stilled, the familiar scent of Hank, assaulting me. He always wore expensive perfume. Unfortunately, my dread of him, now made me find his scent, repulsive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Baby. I missed you terribly. Your touch on my cock. Fucking your beautiful, small mouth. Remember how you couldn&#39;t take all of me into your throat.&#34; Hank growled in my ear. Grinding my arse with his erection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers already in my shirt, tweaking my nipples painfully. I was already wet and at the same time, disgusted by him. I wanted to have sex so bad. But not with Hank Hera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the worst mistake I had ever made and I needed him gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no passion. No compassion. Nothing. It was like he was void of everything but sheer lust and ambition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanna fuck you baby. Right here, right now.&#34; He slipped his fingers into my waistband, finding my center. I gasped. His touch rough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began toying with my clit, evoking soft moans from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard my button unhook, my zipper following. He struggled to lower my jeans and I fought him, pushing him away, gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Hank. If you must have me, then why can&#39;t you cherish me. Be gentle with me,&#34; I fiercely said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes locked with his. He had a cloudy look on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first man I was allowing into my life, and so far, there had been nothing but filthy lust in his eyes. I couldn&#39;t even see any speck of genuine desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Andy described his kind as the ones who fucked and left. Once they got what they wanted, they abandoned you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hardened gaze replaced the lust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been telling me this nonstop for weeks. I can have any pussy I want, Kenya. But I chose you. You should be grateful that I didn&#39;t leave, when my friends advised me. Despite your leg, I stayed.&#34; Hank bitterly spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hitched my breath, astonished. So there hadn&#39;t been any affection for me. He had only seen me as pitiable case. I wanted to cry so bad, but I fought the urge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull, familiar ache, found its way and I embraced it, allowing it take effect on me. I wasn&#39;t going to settle for anyone, who saw me less than human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then leave.&#34; I didn&#39;t know where I found the courage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it rolled off my tongue, effortlessly. Peace filling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My declaration startled Hank, his eyes wide. When he regained himself, his eyes grew dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; He asked. I stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, leave. I don&#39;t need your pity. I told you before, I am keeping myself for my future husband. And I stand on my word, Hank.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hardened his gaze, taking slow steps, until he stood before me. He snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me hear you say that again, Kenya.&#34; His tone dropped to something menacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flinched inwardly, not letting my fear show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shakily, I repeated my words. &#34;I need you out of my life, Hank. Now&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hand struck my face hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I screamed from the impact. Unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ears ringing. The force shifting me. I landed into a pile of wires and appliances, just when I heard my friends rush into the scene. A sharp pain inside my palm and I looked. Blood. A deep gash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah&#34; I cried. Instantly, Andrea rushed to my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rory, call the cops.&#34; Andrea called, sharply. She tried to stem the bleeding, but couldn&#39;t. Rory did as he was told, while Mike and a few other male dancers held Hank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get off me!&#34; Hank Cried, furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a chance. Andrea told me how you&#39;ve been hitting Kenya. This ends now. If she can&#39;t fight you, then we will.&#34; Mike snarled. Someone brought a rope and Hank was tied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re the fuckers that asked her to leave me, huh?&#34; Hank spoke with derision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You deserve it.&#34; Mike threw back, pushing a bound Hank into a seat. Two other dancers came with a first aid kit and finally tended the wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Dave and the cops arrived. The cops asked I pressed charges, but I refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left with a warning, displeasing everyone, present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the cops left, one of them met me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Crimson is the only thing now, tomorrow it could be a coffin. Nip this in the bud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile was wan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes held pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had seen this before.</p>
