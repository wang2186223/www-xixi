                <p>&#34;You.&#34; My voice came out hoarse. I pressed my forehead against hers. &#34;You have been a very naughty girl. And you deserve to be punished for it,&#34; I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want to do to me?&#34; She asked, alarmed. Her voice, shaky. A seductive smile crossed my lips. She quivered beneath my touch. My gaze darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is for leaving the house without informing me.&#34; I kissed her on every word. She moaned and whimpered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And this is for protesting against our union. Especially in front of Blake. Not to talk of wanting him to address you so informally.&#34; I kissed her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time I carried her from the ground, her legs wound round my waist. The kiss, intense. Hungry. I craved her. She was my existence. Her moan made me inwardly smile. Her response, my torment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the bed, I placed her on the red silk covered bed. I lay her flat as we both kissed eachother greedily. Our hands, eager. Our touches clumsy, as we tried to satisfy our urges.The intensity of desire, scorching as we kissed. I could smell her arousal, hot and warm for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I licked her jaw line, nipping and biting her, while my tongue trailed lower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her puckered nipples and sucked each one as I pulled her dress lower. She cried softly, writhing and squirming. I bunched her dress around her waist, not breaking the kiss. I lowered my head to her waist, kissing her as I climbed higher. Drinking her arousal scent in. Savory, heady. I kissed her black lace panties, taking time to look at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this one of the set I got for you?&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded her head. I soared with excitement at that confession. I had hand picked the lingeries for her at an &#39;A&#39; list&#39;s store, on the eve of our wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied, I lowered my head and shifted her panties. Her opening, a sight. I licked her warm, wet center. My tongue stroking and sucking her. Circles and licks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She writhed and cried. Rocking hips to my strokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cum flowed like juice into my mouth and I didn&#39;t stop until I had her writhing and begging. Her cries of my name, a plea to my singed soul. My cock jumped in my black trousers from her reaction. Inserting one finger inside her pussy and the aftermath was a flow of cum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Kenya***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rocked my hips. My lips dry, my gasps rapid. My body tormented. Writhing, surging with pleasure, I cried Levi&#39;s name. A plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrendering, I allowed myself heave the first surge of pressure that buckled me. I quickened inside as he pulled back his finger and thrusted in. The finger deftly found my spot, my juicy center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body surrendered as he latched to my clit, drinking me in. Pleasure tingling me. My cum, flowing, endlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I crashed and prepared myself for the invasion of his large cock in my center, just like the previous night, I felt a chill instead. A shift in the atmosphere. Climbing down the clouds of ecstasy, my senses returning, I raised my eyes to see Levi standing there, watching me from hooded eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I timidily caught sight of the bulge in front of his trousers. Then I lifted my gaze back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;tAren&#39;t you gonna&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finish what I started?&#34; He finished for me. I nodded, shyly. A mischievous smile crossed his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your punishment for being a naughty girl.&#34; He supplied. I stared blankly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I I don&#39;t understand.&#34; I sat up on the bed. Hoping that he was teasing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You desire your release, don&#39;t you?&#34; He fixed a dark gaze on me. His eyes raking my body. &#34;I desire a true union with you. A passion filled marriage. A peaceful co-existence. And whenever you give me half measure, I would give you the same.&#34; He revealed. His words stung me as realization hit me. My body went rigid with shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wordlessly, Levi walked out of the room, grabbing a fresh shirt on his way out, without giving me a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door shut, startling me. I had thought that I would hurt him. That my subsequent actions against him would cause him displeasure. Rather I was the one that received a sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Levi 1: Kenya: 0**</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was I to hurt him if I couldn&#39;t even determine where he&#39;d hurt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because for me to succeed in hurting Levi, to cause him misery just like he had caused me; I needed to unravel him. To undo him like a puzzle, like a mystery. Bit by bit, until I reached his center. Until I shattered him from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choking back a sob, I screamed into a pillow, frustrated. Frustrated at how much I craved him, despite my detest for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remnants of my desire still coursed through me. I rolled on the bed, fighting back my tears. But they kept rolling in. The pain raw in my heart. I didn&#39;t like how I craved him, despite the depravity that was Levi. And yet, I had a deep burn within me for him. Sending my body into a frenzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sobbing, my phone buzzed within my purse beside me on the bed, where I had tossed it earlier, as we kissed. Highlighting the screen, I saw series of calls and chats. As I distractedly scrolled through the missed messages; most from Andrea and my other colleagues asking if the news was true, I saw a fresh message pop from an unknown number. Curious, I opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Unknown Number***: &#34;*Hi. I saw your beautiful photos at Times Square a couple of days ago. You are beautiful, did you know that? Good night.&#34;*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I futilely searched the caller&#39;s I.D. It came out unregistered. Staring at the message, I couldn&#39;t help but be drawn to that harmless confession. It filled me with something different. Like a moth to a flame, I typed out words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**Me**: &#34;*Thank you very much.&#34;*</p>
