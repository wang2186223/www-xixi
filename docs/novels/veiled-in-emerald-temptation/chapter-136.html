                <p>I gazed hard. My beautiful wife bound with thick ropes, in nothing but her undies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head lifted up immediately she heard my voice. Hope soared inside me. Her mouth, gagged, but her eyes spoke enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart broke, seeing her like this. I thought I lost her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*God! I was happy seeing her.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we had finally tracked the car she travelled in, we had come short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting there, the cops and paramedics taking Steve&#39;s body, I hadn&#39;t said a word to the cops. I needed to handle this myself. They had shown me Kenya&#39;s phone, which they had found in the bushes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart dipped into my gut, as the cops asked I gave them time. But I didn&#39;t wait. My men were searching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had prayed to God at some point; asking He helped me find Kenya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t remember the last time I prayed; asked Him for anything. But I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had gone to a church nearby, cried my heart out. Hadn&#39;t cried for years. I asked God for forgiveness. Pleading He didn&#39;t let my wife and unborn baby pay for my sins. I had even reminded him that He was a God of mercy, His love constant. I had promised to confess everything to Kenya. To come clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been stepping out of the church, when Blake called that they had traced the call. The caller, one of his men, hadn&#39;t secured the call; giving us a link to them. And now, here I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strolling into the place, guns were poised as I closed in on the fucker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recognized the mask from the footage of Kenya&#39;s party. And I regretted not discovering the person in time. I hadn&#39;t realized it was Crompton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t investigated him enough. My eyes fell briefly on Kenya. Alarm, relief and elation in her eyes. Eyes that stayed on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You alright, Baby?&#34; I asked her, softly, standing before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded frantically, whimpering. Her words came out muffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time my eyes fell back on Crompton, his mask was off. His eyes, wide with astonishment. He spared her a glance, then turned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be on the news, making a statement,&#34; Crompton said. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34; He asked, fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held his gaze, my expression blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, I had only one intention; get out of here alive with my wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were always a prick face, weren&#39;t you, Pip Squeak.&#34; I snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His man, the caller, had confessed to everything about Crompton under torture. That&#39;s why we delayed reaching here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not Pip Squeak anymore, Kill Code. Bomb Blast.&#34; Crompton cut in, irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*BB.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grinned, darkly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, I remembered him alright. How did I forget? Little kid that joined the gang, few months after I did. Overzealous, overly intelligent genius, who had always loved explosives and computers. Had always thought he eventually ended up in juvie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have remembered one thing about me from back then. Two things I never do; Flight or fright.&#34; I snarled, darkly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze was steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still think you&#39;re better than me don&#39;t you? You&#39;re defeated, Kill Code.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have you cornered. You come here without any men nor weapons. You aren&#39;t leaving here alive. Neither would your sweet, little wife.&#34; Crompton shifted a dirty look to Kenya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bile rising in me. My gut twisted in anger. But I remained composed. Giving nothing away. I could feel Kenya&#39;s eyes on me now, and I just knew she was frightened. We both were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I die tonight, I die knowing It was for her. The woman I love.&#34; I breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard Kenya&#39;s muffled moan beside me. I turned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crompton&#39;s men still had guns poised, but I didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared into my wife&#39;s eyes, surprise in her gaze at my earnest confession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, I finally confessed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in love with my wife. And I had been a fool for suppressing my feelings, all this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Baby, I&#39;ll take a shot for you any day, because I have fallen in love with you. I had fallen months back, but had been too scared to accept.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wished I could see her smile. &#34;You remember when you pole danced for me. We made love and I looked into your eyes for the first time. I saw you.&#34; She nodded, I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knowing look crossed her face. &#34;That was the moment I surrendered to you. But I was a coward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had promised to come clean with her and I was doing that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inhaling a shaky breath, I spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a killer. I&#39;ve been since I was 16. Crompton here was in the gang with us. We killed, supplied hard drugs. We were into it all. I wanted to tell you so bad, but I didn&#39;t know howMy alias was Kill Code. I was a silent assassin that went on missions for our boss, Rowan&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How touching.&#34; I heard a gun click close to my ear, as Crompton snickered. The gun pressed into my skin. &#34;But I don&#39;t have time for this shit. I asked you to do something and you didn&#39;t. You still think I&#39;m kidding right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I know you aren&#39;t. But I want to know, what made you hate me this much?&#34; I asked, quietly. I had no single weapon on me. I had walked in this lion&#39;s den, unarmed. My heart bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t still know?&#34; He asked, incredulously. Raw pain etched in his voice. I shook my head, my hands clenched beside me. &#34;You left me to die in that hell hole, when Rowan got blown up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t remember that. If memories served correctly, I hadn&#39;t selected Pip Squeak on that mission, because he had been too small. Even though he was a couple of months younger than me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t choose you on that mission, Crompton, because&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your biggest sin.&#34;</p>
