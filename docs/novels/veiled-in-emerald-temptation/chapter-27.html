                <p>***Levi.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the room, I slid her down my body, gently. Our gazes locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I locked the door and came to stand before her. So close, her scent mesmerized my senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking all her clothes off, until she was naked before my eyes, I shifted back a step and raked lazy eyes over her beautiful body. She was gorgeous! My Nymph! Mine to behold. Her hips, widely spread, full breasts and her large nipples, bare for my vision. My groin tightened in delicious pleasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently, I wrapped my fingers around her wrist and pulled her towards the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reached the bathroom and I silently undressed. My massive cock, hard for her. I raised my eyes to hers and saw her swallow. I smiled, hoping she wasn&#39;t frightened. I was large, I knew that. Women I had had before usually stretched for me. At 6 ft 2 inches, I always had any other woman with nothing attached. But with Kenya, I found my heart reacting in ways I had never experienced. My body excited to see her. Being with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sauntered towards her and turned her around, pressing her towards my front. My hard cock, prodding the divide of her beautiful broad arse. I trailed lazy fingers along her arms, her sides. Her satin skin, fevered beneath me. She was reacting to my touch. She lulled her head to the side and I kissed her long, elegant neck. I grazed the shell of her ear. Pulling away, I led her to the enormous tub, steam filling the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood there, gazing at the water. Hesitant. I sensed her fear and went to the water. Testing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come join me. The water is still warm.&#34; I turned to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated a bit. But she held my gaze and came over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The water rippled as she entered, our skin glistening as we stood in the water. I reached her, picked up the lavender wash and washed us both, intimately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the bedroom, I sat her before the vanity. Walking to the closet, picking up a black lace and silk dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood behind her, as she gazed at me from the mirror. Her naked skin glowed under the light. I wish I could read her mind. I pulled out a drawer of the vanity and jewelry sets I got her glimmered. Diamonds, sapphires, rubies. Slipping the dress over her body, I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A beauty. That is what you are. Delicate. One to be celebrated,&#34; I whispered, softly. My fingers trailing the hot skin of her arms, neck and jawline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are Aphrodite. You should always be draped in silks and swathed in diamonds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carried one of the diamonds. It had intricate gold vines and a diamond gemstone. She touched it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need all these,&#34; she muttered. I came around and knelt before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indulge me, Kenya.&#34; My eyes glimmered with adoration. &#34;Just for this moment, I am your pliant slave and you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me what?&#34; She whispered, expectantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, &#34;You are my Queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted. Her breath uneven. Her eyes glassy with desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to have me, Levi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her request, simple. Yet it charged an intense desire, so strong that I wondered if I remembered how to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know how much I have wanted to hear that all day.&#34; My words caressed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering my lips to hers, I claimed her mouth in a hungry kiss. A kiss laced with an undercurrent of my desire. Kenya&#39;s kiss had an equal fervor. She moaned. Her fingers, shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising, I carried her in my arms and led us to the silk-covered bed. Not breaking the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We kissed hungrily. The passion deepening. I ripped her dress. She gasped in horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have more in the closet, trust me.&#34; I teased. God, I liked how she wanted me. How her body yielded to me. She was a tease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling the ripped dress lower, I resumed the kisses. My fingers found her nipples. She hissed, as I pinched one nipple. Then moved to the other. I increased the intensity of the pinch. Squeezing and nipping. She moaned, cried. Squirmed. Her sounds sent jolts to my already engorged cock. Her fingers scratching me. I bunched up her dress and trailed my fingers along one thigh, inching closer. Until I reached the middle of her thighs. Bare and ready as I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re wet for me...&#34; I whispered, the words brushing against Kenya&#39;s skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t need to answer. The answer was damp on my fingers. I sucked both her nipples. Starting out weak at first, before the intensity increased. My deft fingers, found her wet, sweet puckered pearl, stroking it in rhythm to my sucks on her nipples. A feeling of waves rippled through me. I was greedy for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cringed and moaned to my wicked acts. I gave a throaty groan, pleasure fully ignited in me. Her hips rocked to the rhythm of my fingers, her cum flooding my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted her dress and lowered myself to her wet, warm center. Her scent, tangy, savory. In one lick, my tongue feasted on her. Eating her. Tasting her. She was sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenya cried. Her head writhing. I drank her in. Sucking. Stroking with my tongue. Circling. She tasted of tang and sweet and salt. She even spoke French. My little wife spoke French.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her quicken. Her passion was reaching its heights, and I was at its door, ready to drink her all in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi!&#34; She cried. Finally surrendering to the throes of passion. Her nectar gushed with life as it spilled into my waiting tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would have drunk you fully, but I need you wet for me to have you whole.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have me...?&#34; She whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled. My eyes tender as I watched her, kissing her. I nudged her legs apart, settling my cock at her entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This would only sting for tonight, my Queen. Tomorrow, and forever, will be pleasure.&#34;</p>
