                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Present day, two days later***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>6 pm and we were having dinner on the terrace, at the President&#39;s private home in North Bay Rd, Miami Beach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another beautiful suburb in Miami Beach. This one, quiet. The president&#39;s house was equally near the water and I could smell the sea. It was wonderful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were dressed casually tonight. The air warm. My hair, a half up do, my body draped in an ethnic mini caftan. Levi wore a red T shirt and blue denims. He smiled as the president told us all a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I loved his smile. He was irresistibly handsome when he smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind went to two nights ago at the club, when he finally joined me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had worn a distant look, even when we danced. But he managed to disguise his countenance with his seductive wiles. Disarming me. Yet I could still feel the tension, in him that night. And when we shared a passionate night, he erased my doubts. His gentleness and attentiveness, comforting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now as we sat down to dinner, I still saw absence of that gleam in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace, tell her how you intend to extend invitations to her students to perform for every holiday.&#34; President William smiled adoringly, holding his wife&#39;s hand in his. She turned elatedly to an astonished me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With your approval dear, I&#39;d love that very much. There is so much sadness going on in the world and I wish to promote joy.&#34; Grace was rueful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I agreed with her. The amount of injustice and pain that was going round the world was appalling. There was no longer value for humanity and It was sad that we all failed our duties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d love that very much Grace. It would be an honor.&#34; We had already moved from formality. I turned to Levi and he silently observed me. Tenderness in his gaze. He reached a hand for mine and thumbed my fingers. His silence was words enough. He was proud of me. I found that I wanted to always make him proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After our very exquisite Mediterranean dinner, courtesy the Walerus&#39; chef, we all took a stroll along the edge. The water lapped aggressively over the dwarf wall, as Levi and I walked a few steps behind the Walerus&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking hand in hand with Levi, the cool air stirred pleasant thoughts in me. His warm fingers tingled me, as they played with mine. I suddenly wished to know him better. Reach his soul. I was succumbing to the waves that he spun, just like the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I feared that I had already drowned in him. My susceptibility, palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you ever have a girlfriend when you were younger?&#34; I asked impulsively. He spared me an amused look. A smile danced on his lips. I hadn&#39;t tried to speak to him about what Liam had shared. And it just stood in between us. It was like I suddenly wanted his passion to begin and end with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Girlfriends.&#34; He laughed lightly. I didn&#39;t find that funny. I felt disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think he sensed my reservation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am sorry. Did that hurt youIt&#39;s just that you asked and&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright.&#34; I managed quietly, sensing his concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped, gently pulling my hands from his and gazing over the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace and the president were still walking, enjoying their stroll. I think my inferiority would always stand in my way of enjoying happiness with Levi. Apart from his past. He asked forgiveness that night of our reception. And in my book that was a step towards redemption from an ugly past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Liam told me that you had mistresses. Lil freaks, as he called them.&#34; My back was to him. Soon, he came up behind me, his warmth fanning behind me. I leaned into his solid form, seeking his support. His strength. I don&#39;t know what was wrong with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He shouldn&#39;t have told you that.&#34; Levi breathed, kissing the top of my head. I suddenly remembered what he had said about Blake then. But that was a different time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I felt jealous. Inadequate. Am not like them, Levi. Why did you marry me?&#34; Tears stung my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wished to just turn to puddle and allow pain sear through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like an anchor, Levi didn&#39;t let me fall. He slowly turned me around to face him. His eyes, intense. Penetrating as they watched me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way, Baby. You are all I want. All I need.&#34; Hoarse, thick with emotion, his voice travelled through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to believe him. I saw those girls. Their natural endowments, intimidating. And not to think of the experience they had with pleasuring men. However, the warmth and conviction in his rich voice, eased me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked into his eyes, my heart filled with adoration for this man, who had saved me from the jaws of death in the most unorthodox way. And who had granted me a chance to be a star. Now because of him, I was pushed to my independence. We had even worked round the trojan horse episode. Discussing everything about my businesses with Claudine and the others. He was supportive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had never fallen in love with a man before. I had no idea what to expect. They said butterflies fluttered in the belly. You&#39;d see the person everywhere. I think I was seeing Levi everywhere. He finally occupied my every existence. And I was defenseless against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring into his eyes, my fingers coming to cup his face, I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I am falling in love with you, Levi.&#34; I smiled, watching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stilled, his eyes searching mine. A certain brief, unfathomable emotion crossing his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently, Levi lowered his lips and kissed me, tenderly. Deeply. There was need in the kiss as we moaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Levi pulled away. There was pain in his eyes, his lips pulled tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you fall in love with a fallen angel?&#34;</p>
