                <p>***Kenya***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Sir. But I wasn&#39;t the lead ballerina. I was just a backup dancer.&#34; I confessed, nervously. His laugh, soft, reached my ears and I found myself settling into the warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know that you weren&#39;t the lead ballerina. But in a building, the hidden pillars give the strength.&#34; I heard again. The allusion and calm voice, inducing a gasp from me. Those words reached somewhere deep in my center, filling me with a sense of welcome. A sense of belonging. All these years since I begun performing for my dance company, I had never been seen as anything but the side ballerina. The backup. Many times, I had wanted to quit dancing for the company. To focus on my job as a ballet teacher for &#39;J&#39;aime,&#39; ; a small dance school, where I taught young girls. But each time, I found myself staying back, because dancing was my identity. It was who I was. It was who I had become. Because in spite of the slight limp in my right leg, which was caused by a birth defect, I still loved to dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you still there?&#34; I heard Mr Ruthford&#39;s voice break into my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Sir. I am. Sorry. I was deep in thought,&#34; I said, quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s no worries. Do you like the roses?&#34; I heard him say. It seemed his breath hitched, as he waited for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yea...Yeah...Sure. Who wouldn&#39;t?&#34; I chuckled. I was nervous. I was not used to speaking to important dignitaries like this. Levi Ruthford wasn&#39;t supposed to talk to me. He was supposed to talk to sweet, beautiful likes of Odette Withers, the lead ballerina. I on the other hand was to be in the dim light. The background, where I belonged. Mr Ruthford, was making me very uncomfortable. I hoped this conversation ended soon, because it seemed I wanted to haul out all I had eaten earlier today. I felt sick to my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. And this brings me to my second reason for calling you.&#34; I heard him pause. I hoped this Mr Blake&#39;s suit didn&#39;t cost a fortune, because it seemed I was about to cast out all my insides on him. I nervously poured out a glass of water from a glass jug that was seated with some refreshments. Taking a sip, I quietly listened to the next words Mr Ruthford had to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Levi***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to have dinner with me, one of these nights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenya choked as she swallowed the water. I stilled, alarm creeping over me, as I heard her coughing. There seemed to be a commotion on the other end. I couldn&#39;t tell. I was helpless and worried, as I heard Blake&#39;s voice, asking her to take some water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright? Kenya? Blake?&#34; I asked, worriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am fine, Sir. I was just...caught off guard.&#34; I heard her confession. I heard her cough again,.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am sorry about that. I couldn&#39;t help it...You are extremely beautiful, Kenya.&#34; My words seemed to make her quiet, because I heard no sound, except her breathing for moments. I wondered at her silence. She was a beautiful woman. A great dancer. I frowned, wondering if I had said something wrong. I was a persistent man. Something I had perfected in all my years as a business man. And I never relented. It was something ladies swooned over, when they saw me. And men cowered at, like wet roosters. Pressing on, I said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I wanted to just sit down with you. Talk and eat. Most times am busy in the day, so I couldn&#39;t suggest lunch. Dinner was the best that I had.&#34; She still said nothing for another second. I could hear her breathing . She hadn&#39;t hung up. Christ! Her silence was unnerving me. I had never seen a woman waste a second in accepting dinner with me. Forgive me if I was suddenly anxious. Even though I was trying to put on a cool facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, I have a slight limp in my right leg.&#34; I suddenly heard her blurt out without restraint. I was taken aback by the earnest admission. My mind, mentally assessing the words. The reason behind them. *Was this her plot to throw me off her scent?* I wondered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suspect you have only reminded me of that to throw me off.&#34; I remarked, amusement hinted beneath my voice, as I found her attempt futile. She trying to dissuade me from finding her as desirable as I already did was cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; She hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I noticed your limp, while you danced. But it didn&#39;t stop you from interpreting the art so, talentedly and gracefully.&#34; I confessed. Indeed I had noticed the limp in her leg. It wasn&#39;t obvious. One only needed to have a keen eye to notice it. Yet I wondered why she assumed I would be thrown off by her limp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I ask you a question?&#34; I pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Sir.&#34; Kenya&#39;s sweet voice came. I loved her voice. It was quiet, had this song song tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I to assume that men don&#39;t ask you to dinner because of that limp?&#34; I bluntly asked. I heard Kenya&#39;s breath hitch. My thoughts randomly guessing hers. Perhaps my question had hit a mark. I couldn&#39;t be certain. I suddenly felt upset. My thoughts going to her. Had she been bullied because of the limp. Belittled, just because of that insignificant flaw. Something that didn&#39;t even matter. I wanted to reach her. To comfort her. My heart suddenly twisted, as I wished to equally hurt those that had ever disparaged her. Then her voice broke into my thoughts. The crack and thickness beneath, confirming my earlier suspicions. I heard pain as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir. I am grateful for the roses. But I am afraid that I have to go. I have some errands to run on my way home.&#34; Her voice was crisp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect. Let me drop you off.&#34; I hastily suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Sir. Good night Sir.&#34;</p>
