                <p>I had asked my clothes be brought in for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t returned to my place since that night, ensuring that I had my eyes on her. I had only asked for change of clothing and my correspondence be handled for me, until I came back. As for more important matters, I only hoped they could wait. My food was brought in for me by Blake, when I needed it. And I caught little sleep on the only available sofa in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I returned from the shower, I allowed myself to sit down on the sofa and in no time, exhaustion overtook me. And I let the sleep ease my worry over Kenya, knowing that I had been unable to catch peaceful sleep in two nights. Because I had been plagued by nightmares of how I had found her that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud opera music sounded in the distance and I wondered when I had entered the opera. As the sound became more insistent, I shook myself and found out that it was Kenya&#39;s phone that was ringing in her bag. I had asked my men to retrieve her belongings from the dance school, before they had cleaned up the entire place. Her phone had died out before I had plugged it in last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growling from the interruption of my sleep, I reached for the phone and found that the caller ID read, &#39;**Mum**.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Fuck. What was I to tell the girl&#39;s mother*? I panicked. I wasn&#39;t sure any woman wanted to hear such an ordeal about her daughter. Deciding to save the woman the trouble, I answered the call on the third ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, baby. Where have you been? I have been calling you.&#34; I heard the woman&#39;s voice over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing my throat, I replied. &#34;Hello Mrs Anderson.&#34; There was a hitch of breath from the other end, before the woman cautiously answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, where is my daughter and what are you doing with her phone?&#34; I heard her say. I sensed the worry in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright ma&#39;am. Your daughter left her phone at my place, before she left for work. We We are dating, you see.&#34; I hastily added. I needed to calm her down, I assured himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;OhAre you Hank? I thought you had both broken up, months ago?&#34; I heard Kenya&#39;s mother say. Bile rose to the back of my throat at the mention of that man&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Ma&#39;am. I am Levi Ruthford,&#34; I said, coolly. There was a brief pause, before she spoke again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Levi Ruthford?&#34; She asked. I could sense that her caution had shifted to curiousity. So to save the moment some more, I decided to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I agreed. There was a small screech on the other side of the phone, before she spoke again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh mywait till her elder sister hears this.&#34; She chuckled. I smiled amusedly, as I wondered if Kenya chuckled like her mum, when she was happy. I had never seen that side of her and discovered that I would want to know. Also, I had no idea that she had a sister. I hadn&#39;t seen any photos of her family that night at her house. Even her phone screen had nothing but the photo of a ballerina taking a leap. Perhaps she was a very private person, I concluded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Mr Ruthford, tell her to call me as soon as she can. I need to hear the entire details. Oh mymy baby dating a senatorial candidate. Oh and so you know, I am voting for you.&#34; She confessed. I chuckled and expressed my gratitude to her. Then we spoke some more about politics, with me realizing that I really wished to meet this woman, before we finally hung up. I smiled as I put the locked phone away in Kenya&#39;s bag. I felt hungry, perhaps the distraction from Kenya&#39;s cheerful mother had helped me and I decided to go grab some coffee from the hospital&#39;s café, downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Kenya***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My senses woke up to the sound of muffled voices in the room. I tried to pry my eyes open, but I was afraid of something, I just couldn&#39;t tell what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled to do so again and this time I succeeded. The light in the room stung my eyes and I found myself fluttering them to regain my vision. My throat felt parched and I had no idea why. I tried to turn my head to the direction of the voices and found that I couldn&#39;t. ***Pain***. I cried out. Thudding feet rushed to my side and I stilled at the sight of Levi Ruthford standing beside a doctor. I locked gazes with Levi, while the doctor checked me, hastily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where does it hurt?&#34; The doctor asked, after he had checked my eyes, vitals and asked all the other questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My head,&#34; I whispered, my eyes finally shifting from Levi to watch the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s expected with a concussion. Do you remember what happened to you, Kenya?&#34; The doctor asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;III don&#39;t remember.&#34; I struggled to say. My mind blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it normal, Doctor?&#34; Levi asked. His eyes on me, soft with every emotion I couldn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is. It was a great injury, Mr Ruthford. Perhaps she had fallen and hit her head, during the attack from the burglars, who knows.&#34; The doctor speculated. &#34;The important thing is that she is well.&#34; The doctor added. I looked from one man to the other, confused. It seemed Levi saw my expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Burglars?&#34; I asked, my voice hoarse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Miss Anderson. You were brought in here, because of the wound you had sustained when burglars attacked your place of work.&#34; The doctor explained. I looked to Levi, my brows creased in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor, would you please leave us.&#34; Levi requested. The doctor nodded his head and assured to send in some painkillers, for my head, before he walked out of the room, quietly.</p>
