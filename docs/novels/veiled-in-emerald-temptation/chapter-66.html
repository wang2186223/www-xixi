                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I no longer kept tabs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted us to talk. I don&#39;t know, I wanted us to be friends again. I didn&#39;t want to believe that I had hurt someone by my actions. Because I had never caused anyone hurt before. That was the reason I hadn&#39;t reported Hank, all those days he abused me. I couldn&#39;t bear him suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any other questions, Mrs Ruthford?&#34; Levi&#39;s warm voice broke into my thoughts. I shook inwardly. His voice, a reminder of his persuasive tone over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are you going to Miami? You promised to take me, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt him inch closer, inhaling my scent. He equally wanted me. My legs grew shaky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next Wednesday,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. I&#39;d like to come.&#34; I finally turned to him, our lips inches away. He lowered his eyes to my lips, strain in his eyes. Then tightly, he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night, Mrs Ruthford.&#34; And he walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there, watching his retreating form. My chest constricted with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang with an incoming text. It was Katie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Katie: Hi Kenya. Please can we see in my office at 9 am, tomorrow.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absently I typed back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Alright. I&#39;d be there.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arrived Katie&#39;s office in time the following morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart beating nervously at whatever she had to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had woken up to find Levi already out of the house. Not a word to me or the staff. I recalled he spoke of meetings. But It didn&#39;t cover for his deliberate avoidance of my presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened and Katie came inside, her eyes darting about as she sat down in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning Mrs Ruthford&#34; She stuttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her, surprised at her countenance. She looked haggard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katie.&#34; My tone, gentle; her gait was jittery. I tried to ignore it, but couldn&#39;t. &#34;You remember I implored that you always maintained my name, whenever we talked. This is one of the only places I want to be me.&#34; I reminded her. She had bags under her eyes. And a few tendrils escaped her usual perfect hair do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie agitatedly nodded her head, averting my gaze. She sifted through a few documents on her desk and raised her eyes to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;MrsKenyaI have good news for you.&#34; She cautiously started. I listened, relieved. It wasn&#39;t bad news as I had suspected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is an investor that has shown interest in the school. Saw my ad on my website and took interest. Wants to be fully involved in every financial obligation. Asked me a few questions about you and all that. But there is one condition.&#34; She paused, watching me. I nodded for her to go on. *Investor*?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The investor wishes to be silent. No physical contact with you. I&#39;d be the middle man. Ensuring you both receive your dividends.&#34; Katie revealed. I nodded thoughtfully. This was great news. An investor taking interest in the business. This could bode well for us. But how did the investor get to see about the school on her website?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you maintain client confidentiality; how did this investor know?&#34; I asked, puzzled. She faltered, tapping her feet on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I put a picture of your school on my new website and that was how the person got to know I represented you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared, doubtfully. Pulling out my phone, I searched her website, which I had never done before. I had just trusted Andrea and proceeded. I hadn&#39;t looked her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True, the picture of J&#39;aime popped up, sliding to give room to five other photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assuaged, I nodded. She heaved a huge sigh, her eyes almost teary. *Was she thinking I would end our association?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, take care of it. At the moment, I need as much help as I can get to ensure the growth of the school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Levi***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office was draped in pitch darkness and cozy, the central air condition cracked to taper down the heat. It was 9pm, and my nerves were already frayed from having to wait this one hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in the cozy leather chair and allowed my mind travel through the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waking again today and not seeing Kenya was getting me edgy. I was unbearable most of the time with my staff, with others. But it didn&#39;t matter, until I had all this sorted out. I couldn&#39;t bear to look at her, until I had all avenues secured for her. She was important to me and not getting to see her face one day, because of a certain jail term, wasn&#39;t something I was ready for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I found her actions careless, I was still proud of her, because she had out smarted me. Something I wouldn&#39;t have anticipated. I smiled. My first smile in days. I was exhausted, but couldn&#39;t pause to rest yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flying over here, a few hours ago, came at a cost to me. I had a few important prior engagements, which needed my attention. But all that could wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened and two people carelessly shuffled in, kissing and groping each other. Clumsy noises accompanied them as they stumbled in, shutting the door. Darkness again. I lowered my mask and the others did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guns cracked and the kissing stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34; Alan asked, cautiously. The lights came on and I didn&#39;t need to see my face to understand his horror. The woman in his arms, *not Amanda*, screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at her, tastelessly. She was of the same hue as his wife, perhaps the same height. But not as pretty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have guards downstairs. CCTV&#34; Alan warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him, silently. Guns were pointed to their heads. Then someone took photos of them. Alan trembled. I gave a signal and someone came over, injecting the girl. She slumped, her heart rate slowing, before our eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tanisha!&#34; Alan called, anxiously, kneeling over her, while she convulsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried holding her, but restrained himself, perhaps afraid, cautious? I couldn&#39;t tell.</p>
