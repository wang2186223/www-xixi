                <p>The first three shorts came, taking down Crompton and two of his men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the seconds that followed, similar shots came. Calculated shots, dropping the men dead. They didn&#39;t even have time to retaliate. I heard Kenya&#39;s sounds beside me and rushed to her. Crouching low, shielding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crompton fell on his knees at our feet, his eyes wide. An opening bore through the middle of his chest, blood soaking his black shirt. He looked pained, staring into my eyes. Shocked, as he realized that he eventually got defeated. That he lost to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let go of the gun, his mouth parted to speak. But no sounds came. Falling to the ground, Crompton lay there. Dead. His gaze, blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fleeting emotion that bordered around pity for Crompton passed through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years he had harbored a grudge against me. And he had grown into a man, bearing such a grudge. I had seen his intelligence and had admired him for it, when we had been in the gang. Perhaps that had been the reason I hadn&#39;t involved him in our missions; I hadn&#39;t wanted him to sully his hands with blood like the rest of us. I had wanted to preserve one innocent from all the evil we had been forced into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A resentment that had caused him to kill his foster family. A family that had taken him in, given him life. An enviable life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his claim, Crompton had no moral rights to murder Greg and his wife. I had known Crompton as Mat Fisher, back in the gang. He had chosen an alias back then. But the rest of us had taunted him with pip squeak and it had somehow stuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he was dead. His life, wasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenya trembled in my arms as the gun shots continued. She couldn&#39;t clutch me, and I missed the feel of her arms around me. But her warmth still came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my head to hers. My embrace silencing her fears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whispered sweet words to her. Calming her, while Albert, his men and mine finished the work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know how I had found the courage to meet Crompton unarmed, but I had suggested it. Intending to stay true to my promise. Coming clean. Albert had agreed to take charge and I had trusted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His team had provided me with a button camera, which they had used to monitor the entire situation. All I had done was step out of the vehicle, while they did the rest. I had no idea where they had been situated. Nothing. Albert had only asked for a riddle as the signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments later, the sounds of guns quieted and all the smoke began to clear. A silence filled the air for a few seconds, before the thudding of heavy feet announced the presence of Albert and our men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All dressed in black camo uniforms, ski masks, gadgets, weapons strapped; they rushed in. Checking the bodies of Crompton&#39;s men on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All clear!&#34; One of the men declared. My heart relieved at the sound. I looked at Albert, who was the only man among them without a mask. His eyes fixed on me, he nodded that we were safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, I pulled away from the embrace. I regretted not bringing a jacket for Kenya, as I was only in slacks, a shirt and waist coat. Luckily, someone was thoughtful enough to bring a fire blanket for Kenya.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I covered her in it, her eyes holding mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently, I took away the gag, which had been taped at the back. Her eyes had tears as our gazes held. Her lips parted. And I found my heart in my mouth, anticipating her next words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know what to say myself, but I wanted to hear her. Someone gave me knife and I reached to begin cutting the ropes, when I saw wires strapped to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Albert&#34; I called, worriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came, his eyes falling on the wires. I caught the look on his face and I paled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Explosives.&#34; Albert confirmed my fears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blake sauntered over in that moment, paling at Albert&#39;s declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Kenya finally spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*So much for the words I wanted to hear.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to hold her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Albert frowned, assessing the wires. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say on our way here the guy was a genius with explosives and computers.&#34; Albert reminded me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had informed Albert of my entire life back then. He had been shocked. The only thing he had said was that we had lived shitty lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do?&#34; I asked, alarmed. I felt Kenya shudder beneath my arms, while I tried being calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi&#34; Kenya called, softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*God I had missed the sound of my name on her lips.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Albert walked to go speak to his men, who had been checking the place. Blake drew closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Mrs Ruthford.&#34; Blake managed a smile, even though his fear mirrored mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenya whimpered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am scared, Levi. What&#39;s going to happen?&#34; She asked, me. And there I saw it. That look of utter trust, which she had always given me, even before we tied the knot. That look which showed I was her entire world. She was mine to protect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t let anything happen to her, now that I was aware of my feelings for her. I needed to protect her. Be her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Albert strolled over with two of his men, bearing a heavy tool box. They knelt beside Kenya, pushing the box open. Sophisticated tools.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They began working the device, which was connected beneath her chair, no form of explanation. Their meticulousness frightened Kenya. The tension in the air palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had lost her before. I wasn&#39;t losing her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring deep into her beautiful eyes, I kissed herr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A Deep, passion filled kiss. She moaned, despite her fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling away gently, I whispered in her lips. &#34;You&#39;re going to trust me.&#34;</p>
