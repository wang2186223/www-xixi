                <p>***Present day, August 31st***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were meaningless now. I wanted him to leave the room. But he didn&#39;t. We just sat there. Me crying, him sitting beside me. The night seeping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to lean into him, draw strength from him. But I couldn&#39;t, because he was the reason I was currently in this condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*A man like his father.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking extreme measures, not caring the consequences. I didn&#39;t need to ask another word from him. All I needed was to sleep this ache away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right next to me. Silently assessing me. I hated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not going to remain married to you emotionally, Levi. Only on paper,&#34; I said, not sparing him a glance. He gave no reaction, only watched me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No commitments. Nothing more expected of me.&#34; I hated that he wasn&#39;t giving any reaction. I hated that my words didn&#39;t have the desired effect on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes finally on him and I met his stare. We stayed silent. Just watching. The air heavy. A crackling tension. An undercurrent of loss, pain, regret, betrayal, hate. Tearing us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long will you be able to manage that?&#34; He asked, breaking the heavy silence. His eyes, narrowed on me. I frowned, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Manage what?&#34; I asked, tersely. He grinned, devilishly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Staying away.&#34; He dangled before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stilled. Infuriated at his audacity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was aching. Realizing that he was never going to repent. He was going to remain the monster. Just like his father had been. He was going to keep me forever drowned in his evil secrets. Only letting me get consumed by his true form; the devil in a handsome flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soon you&#39;d begin to crack.&#34; His voice pulled me back to him. &#34;You&#39;d crave me. My touches, my kisses. It would be like you&#39;re suffering withdrawals. Like your entire world is crashing around you. And you&#39;d need me. What would you do then? Fuck other me? They wouldn&#39;t satisfy you. They wouldn&#39;t give you what I have given.&#34; He was tormenting me. My torturer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would do whatever I deem fit. I&#39;d fuck whoever I want, when the time comes.&#34; I spat, bitterly. He regarded me with a dark look. One that shook me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d like to see you try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words held such finality. No argument, because he knew he had already won. He didn&#39;t fight me. He just regarded me with a dark grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds, he rose from the floor. Levi had no compassion in his eyes. He didn&#39;t even ache, seeing me distressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Would he have ever fallen for me? Or had I being playing with a flame that would eventually sear my heart?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking off his top clothes, ensuring his eyes watched me as he did so, he went to his closet. He returned and placed some medication packets on the night stand, grabbing a glass. Fetching some water, he popped pills in his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His entire torso was exposed. I took him in. Chiseled, his arms tight. His &#39;V&#39; narrowed into his slacks. His throat worked magically, drinking the water. I imagined him drinking my cum. I clenched my thighs. My eyes following the water trailing down his throat, down his chest. I swallowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew what he was doing. Seducing me. Making his point clear. My eyes drifted to his wound, which made him look dangerously appealing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What was wrong with me?* I was doing what he had predicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I raised my eyes to his face again, I found him watching me. A knowing look on his face. His action had been deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently, Levi returned the glass to the night stand and climbed into bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds, I climbed in after him. My body tired, I slipped out of my robe, lying in bed. Backing him. I scooted to the side. Not wanting his touch. Tears flowing down and I drifted into sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how long I was asleep for, when I instinctively reached for Levi. Finding him right where I wanted him. Behind me. His solid form against me, pressed tight. No space between us. His hand was draped possessively over my waist. His breath even as he slept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my arse against him, until I felt his hard cock. He groaned in his sleep. I wanted to banish the nightmares that threatened me. To dispel this pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want me?&#34; His voice, warm. I gasped, nodding to his voice. He pressed closer. I heard his zipper. My heart quickening in my chest. &#34;You can have me. I wouldn&#39;t deprive you. It&#39;s only you that would be depriving us of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had won. I couldn&#39;t escape him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached my hand for him, touching his cock, which he had already released. He was hard. I was wet. Tears slipped down my eyes at the depth of feelings I had for him. Yet he was this evil. And I still craved him. I exiled those thoughts. Not letting them root in my mind, in my desires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt his fingers worry the hem of my panties. I gasped. I pressed closer and he slipped a finger into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re already wet for me. Do you want to come for me, Baby?&#34; He whispered. I nodded frantically. My mind spinning. His weight shifted on the bed and I felt his hard cock fill my entrance. He was taking me from behind, like this. I liked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, Levi was buried to the hilt inside me. My hips rocking to him. Our sounds filling the room. Our bodies linked, taking and giving. I pushed forward, pressing further into him. He gasped sharply. I feared I had hurt him. But he stayed me, pressing further into me. The angle sent me to instant climax. I shuddered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued pumping me, until we released simultaneously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his lips into my neck, whispering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Admit it, you wouldn&#39;t be able to stay away</p>
