                <p>&#34;It is. You have turned me into a shadow of myself. But that ends tonight.&#34; I hesitated before I continued. My voice breaking, dropping low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was enraged. My anger was palpable. My heart burning with the ache of all my disappointment and exhaustion. I was tired of Levi&#39;s manipulations. His games. I needed to stand up for myself. To rise above the abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had asked me for forgiveness the other night, yet here we are. The same moment we were, before your request. How can I forgive one who remains bent on being who he is? A rogue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook as sobs escaped me. My words rolled off my tongue. The reality of my sorrow, settling in. Rocking my existence. There was a sudden sadness that embraced me and I didn&#39;t think I had the strength to accept it. Even though most of me felt this sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From now on, I would take control of my life.&#34; My words rang in my ears, strong and determined. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t let you control me anymore. I would be strong and I would take back my life, Levi Ruthford. Beginning tonight, I&#39;d be forging fires that will burn every part of you.&#34; I sobbed. Levi silently watched me, his jaw twitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glaring at him one last time, I brushed past him, opened the door and walked out of the bathroom. My piercing words echoed in my heart, giving me strength to walk on, without succumbing to my weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked out into the cold night, the biting wind reminding me of the cruelty that surrounded me. I didn&#39;t wish to wait for the car. But I needed to leave this party, away from Levi&#39;s presence. Darting my eyes to the left, I saw a cab just pull up, dropping a passenger. Not waiting a second more, I slipped into the cab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, take me to this address on 57th.&#34; I requested, flashing my phone screen in the face of the driver. I still found it difficult acquainting myself with my new home. &#34;But first take me to Greenwich Village.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Lady.&#34; The cab man nodded, pulling out into the traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car drove off, I scrolled to Andrea&#39;s number and texted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Andy, can we meet tomorrow at your apartment after church. I have something to discuss with you.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited a little and Andrea&#39;s response popped up the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Andrea: Alright, Ken. Everything okay? See you tomorrow***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blew out a breath and leaned back in the seat, allowing tears blur my vision. It was time for me to create a new life for myself and I needed to do it now. No more hanging there and letting others rule my life. Manipulate my existence like Levi had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone suddenly buzzed in my hands and I checked the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Unknown Number: Hi, beautiful. How is your evening going? Mine is rather dull, you see. I hope you are smiling, tonight. 😊***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched the screen for a few seconds, contemplating the words that stared back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh tears flooded my eyes and I allowed them fall. I had started caring for my husband and had hoped that night he asked forgiveness, he intended to change. To share his life with me, to let me in. To know why he had done all he had. I had truly thought we had reached a compromise, that night of the reception. Now it turned out that he would never be more than that dangerous manipulator. The dangerous murderer. Words, which I hadn&#39;t wanted to acknowledge in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, I had to accept this bitter truth and move past it. Killing whatever emotions that had started showing face for him. Knowing that his demons will always be an extension of his personality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes fell to the message on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: I had a fight with my husband tonight. I hope you can make me happy, because my happiness has become my priority.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lengthened pause came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Unknown Number: I&#39;d be honored to make you happy.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, I typed, my curiousity piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Am Kenya, but you can call me Ken, like everyone else does. What&#39;s your name? Sorry I haven&#39;t asked you since we started chatting.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Unknown Number: K.C. And I would call you Kenya. I am not everyone else.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Alright. Goodnight K.C. Am already reaching my stop***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***K.C****:* ***Goodnight, Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Two days later...***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Tuesday, and the rain pelted down the umbrella that Ryan held over my head, as I came out of the car to enter Claudine&#39;s apartment building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I phoned Claudine earlier in the day, to inform her that I was coming to see her. However, the rain wasn&#39;t one I had anticipated to fall this long. All morning, falling in heavy droplets, bringing with it a biting chill that soured my mood, along with my flowing period. Somehow the emergence of my period gave me confusing feelings, bordered around disappointment and relief. But I had no idea what I felt disappointment for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Greeting the familiar doorman, Eric, as I walked in through the front entrance, I entered the elevator. My eyes caught sight of Ryan, the security guard Levi assigned to me, conversing with Eric, as the doors slid shut. The memory of Levi coercing me into accepting Ryan as my permanent body guard, threatened to push through my thoughts, but I dispelled it. Choosing to focus on my current task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator door opened with a ping as it reached the 5th floor. I walked down the hallway, until I reached Claudine&#39;s apartment, apartment 521 A. Inhaling a deep breath, I pressed the door bell and waited for Claudine to answer. In a few seconds, the door opened with Claudine standing in the door way, beautiful and graceful as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Kenya. You made it despite this rain.&#34; Claudine smiled warmly, greeting me in an embrace. Her slight accent still tinged her words, despite all these years.</p>
