                <p>***Levi***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recalled the time at Ruthford Mansion. How my parents&#39; so-called socialite friends bluntly shoved the door in our faces as my mother and I groveled for food. Turning their backs to us in our time of need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A 15-year-old boy then, who had seen his mother crying and begging men and women, who she had been better than, once upon a time. But the carelessness of my father, Richard Ruthford, had brought us to the brink of the abyss. To a point where I couldn&#39;t bear to watch my beautiful mother, Christina, beg my late father&#39;s friends, who had only watched her with dirtiness in their eyes. Oh I had shown them, each of those men. And I hadn&#39;t spared those eyes of theirs. It was the eyes of those men on my virtuous mother that had pushed me to the jaws of death and back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of my mobile phone ringing on my office desk, jolted me from memory lane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Benjamin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Levi.&#34; Benjamin Moore greeted from the other end. He was my late wife&#39;s twin, who lived in England. Nice guy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I breathed deeply, a sense of unease and guilt, filling my lungs as I heard his voice. He was the last memory of Belle I had. The last memory to the Moore line. His uncanny resemblance to Belle, unnerving. I rose from my seat and walked to the window of the *Tribeca STA Constructions building*, gazing at the city view. The renowned Woolworth Building, staring back at me, from across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I absently stared at the Neo gothical building, I could just as well see Benjamin&#39;s pair of turquoise blue eyes from the window, smiling at me. Eyes that always reminded me of his late sister, Belle. Eyes that always haunted me. That was the reason I had cut away from him, after Belle&#39;s death. I refused to even do business with him, directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you, Levi?&#34; Benjamin&#39;s voice broke into my hazy thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am fine, Ben. Just a bit burned out, that&#39;s all.&#34; I told him. A brief pause filled the air, before Benjamin inhaled a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi, You&#39;ve got to take care of yourself. You know you are the the last thing I have to Belle, apart from our uncle, Howie.&#34; Benjamin chided coolly. His words reminded me of what Belle would have said to me, if she was still alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit back the thought by cracking a bitter chuckle before I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I take care of myself, Ben. I just need more distraction, that&#39;s all.&#34; I mused. My thoughts briefly went to Kenya, at the idea of me indulging in a little distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since that night I unexpectedly dropped by her house, I hadn&#39;t called her or seen her. And that was already a week. I had deliberately fought myself from seeing her since then, because I was scared of my actions if I saw her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw the news on the internet and on television. What are we going to do about the women complaining on you? Would you like me to talk to them or something?&#34; Benjamin suggested, shifting my thoughts from Kenya. I paused thoughtfully for a moment before I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Benny.&#34; I said, quietly. I didn&#39;t need him to involve himself with my mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathing steadily, I continued. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. We are going to win, Benjamin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Win, Levi?&#34; Benjamin asked, skeptically. I knew our relationship was strained, since Belle&#39;s death. He held certain misgivings against me, since then. Especially after the media had speculated bullshit about my involvement in her death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How? They need you to have a wife? And the last I checked that would be insulting my sister, my family,&#34; Benjamin said, impatiently. That was another contention we had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Belle&#39;s death, Benjamin considered my staying unmarried, respectable. Though masked, but it was there. When ever anyone suggested I remarried, he got irked over it. Tension crackling. As for the elections, I was sure we would win. Even though Harley Crompton currently had more stands than I did. Being a man from a long line of notable male republicans, Crompton was a better choice. While I was a democrat from a long line of Hispanics, French and Polish immigrants that dated years back. Way before I was born.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rest easy, Benjamin. We will win.&#34; I assured him. &#34;How is England, by the way? And your uncle Howie? And Angela? You both still dating?&#34; I asked, shifting the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do know I and Angie broke up months back. And Howie is great.&#34; Benjamin replied, chuckling. I had heard of his break up with Angela. I had thought they had gotten back together. Laughing to ease the moment, I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, man. Your laughter just sounded like Belle&#34; I trailed off. I had just unconsciously broached a forbidden topic. Since Belle&#39;s death, neither of us had spoken so intimately of herwell really spoken of her. We had avoided speaking about such intimate topics of her that could evoke horrid memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have got to go, Levi&#34; Benjamin said, tightly. His voice was detached. He was doing it again; trying to escape the grief. It had been years now. Yet, the pain divided us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, Ben.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh just as an addition. I would be dropping by next month for some business.&#34; Benjamin added, his tone flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helplessly, I replied. &#34;Alright, Benjamin. I&#39;d be expecting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin gave a grunt and the phone went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadness washed over me. The day Belle got buried, right before I and Benjamin&#39;s eyes, that same day I lost my sense of feeling. But somehow, the presence of Kenya was cracking open that void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short knock on the door and I turned my attention to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr Ruthford, the exclusive interview with Shirley O&#39;Brian is in the next two hours. Where are we to begin?&#34; My secretary, Renee said. I gazed at my watch. 10am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*From Hell&#39;s kitchen.&#34;*</p>
