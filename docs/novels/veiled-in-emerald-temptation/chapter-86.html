                <p>***Present day, five days later***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Thursday afternoon, August the 8th and I was checking out the designers as they applied the décor to the school&#39;s walls. Before the end of the week, the furnishings were to be put in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things were looking good with the appearance. I was looking forward to pink, white and blue colors. Currently a wall paper of white, cobalt blue and gold filigrees, was applied on the wall of one of the dance halls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try making it smooth. We wouldn&#39;t want the walls bumpy.&#34; I suggested, my eyes admiring the work. I was in casual blue denim slacks and white shirt sleeves. My hair was braided and I had some paint on my slacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang in my pocket and I absently picked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi. Is this Mrs Ruthford?&#34; I heard a man say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Who is this?&#34; I asked, walking to check Andrea in one of the free halls, as she approved the dresses for the students.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A designer had the dresses accurately made for the students, who had all tested the dresses for any mistakes, three days earlier. Pink tulles for girls and blue slacks for boys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Nero; Director of Photography with Ritzy Leigh Fashion and Lifestyle Magazine. We would like to proposition you to be the face of our winter edition for the magazine.&#34; The man revealed. I held my breath in shock as I listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you agree, you&#39;d be paid handsomely and also receive a contract to be an ambassador for the magazine for the next 5 years. Featuring in every winter edition of the magazines. Your style and tips about life, will be seen by most women and men of the world.&#34; The man concluded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to talk but I was too surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I am a bit shocked.&#34; I finally summoned a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind trying to assimilate all he had said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ErrCan I think about it. Perhaps a couple of days. I&#39;d like to check in with my legal team,&#34; I said, excitement surging through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Mrs Ruthford. Please, we will be expecting your response.&#34; The man concluded, ending the call on a warm note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was that?&#34; Andrea asked, raising her eyes from the clothes that she and two other helpers had been sorting through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at Andrea, still bewildered. I had heard of Ritzy Leigh Magazine. A renowned magazine with tentacles spread all over the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just asked to be the face of Ritzy Leigh.&#34; I informed Andrea. I waited for her expected reaction. She and the other two ladies stilled. Instinctively, Andrea jumped with glee, hastily closing the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugging me, she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is so wonderful! Congrats babes. I&#39;m so happy for you.&#34; Her enthusiasm was contagious and I found myself smiling. The other women spared me furtive glances, their eyes holding admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stealing Andrea away for a moment, we walked into what is to be her office. It was already taking shape. A couple of chairs and a desk were packed at a corner, soon to be assembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know Andy. What am I going to do? I&#39;ve never been a face of anything.&#34; My eyes fell to Andrea&#39;s hand which held a beautiful, tiny ruby ring on her engagement finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally agreed to Mike&#39;s marriage proposal, while we were in Miami. They were planning their wedding after the reopening of the school. I never wanted all this attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had already turned down a few endorsements, which I had seen too demanding. And I was currently displayed on Times Square, as the face of a perfume. I only wanted a quiet life, where I&#39;d have my little career and a family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I had wealth that seemed to be a distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to be with Levi. I&#39;m not asking for much,&#34; I ruefully said. We were going to watch a movie later this evening. I bought us tickets, because I wished us to spend a normal outing together, without all the attention that accompanied his social status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does that affect your acceptance of this offer?&#34; Andrea asked, incredulously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. I would be too busy with the endorsements to see him. I haven&#39;t even had any chance to visit Alan&#39;s studio in Hollywood, because I am giving more time to our marriage these days.&#34; I revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alan had been calling me to come down, so that we finalize the contract for my role in the movie. But I was reluctant. My entire world suddenly lived and breathed Levi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babes, Levi is a focused man. I have seen it in his drive. Look how he got Sara to take over the entire project with the reopening of the school. He wouldn&#39;t want his wife to be less. I admire him for that. All over the media, he has announced your reopening in a few weeks. He is proud of you. Don&#39;t let him down.&#34; Andrea encouraged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at her, inwardly wondering when Levi and I had gone from enemies to devoted spouses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think he&#39;s proud of me?&#34; I pressed, holding Andrea&#39;s gaze. She smiled as she nodded her head. Then in order to relieve the emotion that weighed in my heart, Andrea held me in a comforting hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t undermine your husband, Kenya. You are his priority.&#34; Andrea added, her warmth travelling through me and conveying a message, which my heart was being too blind to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because I had been waiting for Levi&#39;s actions and words to reveal the depth of his feelings for me, I had invested all my energy anticipating his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, in the absence of either of those, I found myself comfortable with a third opinion, especially one from my friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have I come in at a bad time. I can just go back to work.&#34; Rory&#39;s voice broke into our moment, pulling us apart. We chuckled nervously, our eyes falling on Rory.</p>
