                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Two Weeks Later...***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Girls, girls, girls. Again from the top. First position. Second Position. Third. Fourth. And finally, fifth.&#34; I called audibly to my girls in class. Smiling in return to the girls&#39; whose smiles lifted my heart. I loved my students so much. They were one of my most treasured darlings in my life, next to my mother and my sister, because they didn&#39;t judge my imperfections. Rather, these young girls, saw as a leading light. I stretched myself fluidly, to release all the knots in my limbs, after all the practice that had just transpired. It was 6 pm, and the girls&#39; parents were already awaiting them, to take them back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright girls, your families are already waiting to take you home. You must remember to always practice at every chance you&#39;ve got. Practice makes perfect.&#34; I reminded the girls, who were gathering their personal belongings to leave. A few of the girls came over to give me a hug on their way out. Gladly, I shared the affection with the girls and watched them all file out of the room to meet their families. A few of the parents were talking with the owner of the establishment, Claudine, who stood there, talking excitedly with them. Claudine was a beautiful and graceful woman, who had once been a top ballerina, back in her days. Her love for the arts, as well as her drive to teach other young women, had motivated her to establish the dance school, years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away, I began to clear up the practice arena, so that I could get on my way home. I loved my job as a teacher very much, but sometimes I grew emotionally exhausted, watching the young girls trying to create a perfection out of themselves. No matter how I reminded them that they couldn&#39;t be perfect and should appreciate themselves, wholeheartedly, I always had a few girls crying in the corner, feeling inadequate. Their struggle usually reminded me of how much I had put into being perfect, during the early years of my life. Now, as a 23-year-old, I no longer put in that much effort to be appreciated. I only carried myself to wherever the wind led me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the familiar foot falls of Claudine as I put the last of my stuff away, ready to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweet heart, the parents are so happy with all your hard work with the girls. They say you have built a certain confidence in their girls that is highly commendable.&#34; Claudine chimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling back, I replied, &#34;Claudine, we all have you to thank for setting *J&#39;aime* up, in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudine laughed, pleasantly and gave a look around the quaint, practice room. &#34;I have Jimmy to thank, for his generosity after our divorce,&#34; Claudine said sarcastically. I chuckled at the woman&#39;s words. Smiling at how Claudine never failed to let everyone know about her generous divorce settlement from her ex-husband from 10 years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing my hand bag, I accompanied Claudine to the reception, chatting about a new dance routine that Claudine wanted the girls to learn. A dance routine, which I doubted the girls had the heart to execute. But Claudine was a woman with a hard drive and she expected such from both her employed teachers and the students.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh look,&#34; Claudine said, her focus on the TV screen, where the weather woman was rattling on, &#34;The weather woman says it&#39;s expected to have hailstorms in Colorado, tonight. I wish it would rain tonight in NYC.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Claudine, please, don&#39;t summon the rains with your mouth.&#34; I teased, smiling as I picked up my mail from Katie, the receptionist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya darling, I don&#39;t need to summon the rains. The weather woman already declared hail in Colorado. I only wish it could rain in NYC tonight, that&#39;s all. At least with that, one can have a weather for two. Just like Katie hopes for a weather for two. That is why she has Gerald out there in the car, waiting for her. Isn&#39;t that so, Katie?&#34; She flashed Katie a teasing smile, which made the young woman, uncomfortably shy. I laughed at the scene. It was an attribute of Claudine to tease her staff at every given chance she got. A funny woman she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quit making her uncomfortable, Claudine. I am sure that Gerald is only here, because he doesn&#39;t want any other man to gaze at his Katie.&#34; I equally teased. Katie smiled, shyly and tried to avoid eye contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding the entire scene hilarious, I made ready to exit the building, after grabbing my mail. Then the face of Levi Ruthford, suddenly filled the TV screen, halting me in my steps. He was talking to the press and there was a news item on the bar that stated some of the women of NYC weren&#39;t comfortable having an unpatriotic senator, who wasn&#39;t family oriented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do they mean, &#39;unpatriotic senator&#39;?&#34; I asked Claudine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, nothing. Just that the man isn&#39;t married, since he got widowed, years back. It&#39;s odd isn&#39;t it? He has remained unmarried, has no tangible ties to any woman, that we can say would lead to a potential suit. To give him a family. Yet, he wishes to be a New York Senator? He expects votes from the family oriented New Yorkers.&#34; Claudine explained, ruefully. I looked at the man- *that is really looked at him*\- as a man and not a politician on the TV. And I decided he was handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Extremely hot at 6 ft 2, as I had read. His shining jet black hair, cropped in a stylish cut, with the top slightly tussled and his perfectly trimmed facial hairs; he looked roguish. Had such a man spoken to me? Sent me red roses, two weeks ago?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wondered if I had done the right thing, not accepting his dinner invite two weeks back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I for one have nothing against the man.&#34; I heard Claudine declare, quietly.</p>
