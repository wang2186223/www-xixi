                <p>***October 18th, twenty years earlier***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay in bed, Meghan rolling her hips on top of me. Her cry of release, my undoing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blood pumping in my crotch, pleasure searing me, I finally came. Letting out a guttural cry, my release explosive, filling Meghan. She was on birth control, so we had no issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally asked her to the dance, days ago and she delightfully agreed. She thought that I had found someone else, so she had reined in her disappointment. Letting the dance go all together, if she couldn&#39;t have me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sex tonight with her was her gratitude. Remarkable how wealth could make girls older than me, like Meghan, flutter around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was 16 and could have any of the older boys, yet she went for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard she had been dating the quarter back in our team, until last month. He dumped her arse for Lucia, her best friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finished and I leaned over. Picking a box of scented wipes for us. She kissed me and I smiled, wanly. Distracted by the news I had read on the internet earlier in the day, about stocks falling in most of the major companies. The media was considerate not to name the companies, because of the damage it would cause the families involved. Yet my worry lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I called dad, he assured me our safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In spite of dad&#39;s words, I couldn&#39;t dispel the doubt that gnawed inside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hear that Abel&#39;s father was affected by those fallen stocks?&#34; Meghan softly said. I turned to her. She sat upright, pulling elegant fingers through her shining blonde hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body shook with alarm and curiosity. *How did she get to know? I thought the names weren&#39;t published.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to school my emotions, but it was difficult, considering I had no certainty about my family&#39;s standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know?&#34; I cleared my throat. She shrugged. Shrugged to a situation such as this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His father was a customer in dad&#39;s bank until this morning when he lost everything.&#34; She smiled, kissing me full on the lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, Meghan&#39;s dad would know that, since he owned a bank. Mirage was a family owned bank, established years ago by the Reeds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Timothy Reed, was a very shrewd president of the bank and he was renowned for his lack of leniency with his customers. Thankfully, dad wasn&#39;t his customer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder how Abel&#39;s taking it?&#34; I asked no one in particular. She shrugged again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talia, his girlfriend says he has been called back home. They&#39;ll be leaving for Phoenix in a few days. That&#39;s the only home they&#39;ve got left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t see pity in Meghan&#39;s eyes as she spoke. To her, Abel Greenoff, was another statistic in Mirage&#39;s books. This could be my story, if Dad&#39;s equally affected. I had no clue on that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shuddered, wondering how these guys that called themselves friends, could go from friendly to standoffish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to be nonchalant, I shrugged. &#34;It&#39;s his loss.&#34; But my heart said differently. I needed to drop Meghan at her own apartment, so that I could privately speak to my mum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, I dropped Meghan off in my sleek blue Porsche. A birthday gift from dad. Agony stirred me at the thought of having all these, seized by a bank. I sympathized with Abel, tremendously, but I couldn&#39;t help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meghan hadn&#39;t even ceased chattering about Abel&#39;s woes on our way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night, Levi.&#34; She kissed me deeply, just before she exited the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drove to a quiet corner and invainly phoned mum. It was 9 pm and she was probably at a party or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing to trust dad&#39;s words, I drove back to my apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***October 31***st,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Thirteen days later***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was finally the annual fall dance and all of us trudged into the venue. Dressed in majestic costumes and masks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The senior girls from St Catherine&#39;s Private Boarding school, accompanied us as dates for the night. It was a fun program that both prestigious schools participated in. Allowing social interaction amongst students.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wore a white tux and white cape. A white angel&#39;s mask draping my face, looking regal. Even Meghan was beautifully dressed as calypso. Her hair held in Grecian style.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you supposed to be?&#34; Albert, dressed as a Scandinavian warrior, with a cosplay sword sheathed at his side, asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An angel&#34; I shrugged playfully. Caprice stood by his side, dressed as Athena. She looked beautiful as well. We laughed at our silliness and entered the party, mingling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Way into the night, I was kissing Meghan, stroking her. Our bodies pressed together as we danced like the other couples in the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I liked dating her, even though she was older me. I liked our chemistry and I was aware it wouldn&#39;t lead anywhere, but I liked having the popular girl as my date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to make this official?&#34; I whispered in her lips. Kissing her to accentuate my words. She gasped, excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d be delighted Levi. I thought you&#39;d never ask.&#34; She gifted me a kiss, my cock already tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, what about our age difference. You don&#39;t mind after high school I&#39;d be off to college?&#34; She hesitantly asked. I shrugged. I didn&#39;t if she didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind. Let&#39;s bother about us here and not after high school.&#34; I thoughtfully said to her. &#34;Life after high school would take care of itself.&#34; I smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi! Levi!&#34; I heard someone call a few steps away. We turned and I saw Lincoln walking over. He was on our football team. I frowned, drawing closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meghan&#39;s fingers were laced sweetly in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up, Link?&#34; I scowled. His look was grim, as he showed me his blackberry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father, dude. He committed suicide hours ago. The banks came for everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ice crawled into my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the King&#39;s horses couldn&#39;t stop humpty from falling.</p>
