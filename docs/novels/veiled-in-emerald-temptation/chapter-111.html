                <p>***February 13th, 18 years earlier***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A drop gone wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled darkly, knowing the eventual outcome. Watching the scene before my eyes. My plan unfolding as I plotted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had finally let Rowan in on the deal. Got him involved with very wealthy dealers in Detroit. Demanding dealers, of I was permitted to say. Everything was going smoothly. The drop set for February 5th. Rowan was completely elated, knowing that the dealers were ready to pay millions for the packages of ice he was offering. Even coke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was neutral. Watching from the sidelines. Viewing the entire drama. My personal soap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dealers sent one of their men to ensure we followed through. He called himself &#39;The Contact.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*These guys.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I even suggested that Black Pea made the trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was eight days ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four days later and the dealers in Detroit hadn&#39;t received the drop. They grew pensive and threatened to smoke Rowan for reneging on a deal. I watched the frenzy, knowing that my plan was running smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Black Pea was nowhere to be found and neither was the middle man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Ice and coke, equally gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rowan was incensed, combing the entire Big Apple for both men. He even placed a bounty on their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then three days ago, someone revealed their hideout. A beat down motel in Kalamazoo. They were heading for Florida, when the bounty hunters caught them. Dragging them over here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, please, don&#39;t do this man. I swear I didn&#39;t mean to go against your orders. I&#34; A sharp scream followed the words, the echoes from the building shrilling the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi, Finish this. I don&#39;t want this mother fucker in my eyes one minute longer.&#34; Rowan ordered, quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words a familiar sing song. I rose from where I had been sitting on a broken table, mindlessly watching the entire scene. Knowing that I had set the smoke that had trapped the rat. *Black Pea.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You see, I had ensured a rumor reached Black Pea that I was going to kill him, if he didn&#39;t escape. That I was going to ensure Rowan knew the truth about what truly went down that night in Detroit. No one knew that truth but me. My truth. However, I had spread word around. I made my loyalists fill Black Pea&#39;s head with ideas of him making the cut with someone better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he had bought it. I had seen desperation in his eyes the moment he had received the packages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing closer now, my steps taken in slow strides, I reached the screaming man, who was hung upside down from a rope. My eyes turned stone cold, my lips thin as I observed the man. Writhing and alarmed. Worrying his bonds, he whimpered. Recognition in his eyes as he saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, LeviPlease. Ask him to give me another chance. It was Black PeaBlack Pea suggested the drop to Ice Fred, for better cutYou know I wouldn&#39;t do bad on him, man.&#34; The contact desperately pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling my blade, the light catching the fire that burned in a beat up barrel, I sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one but him, calls me Levi here.&#34; I growled, quietly. &#34;And as for Black Pea, he&#39;s own is coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the horrorstruck look on the whimpering man&#39;s face, I grinned, darkly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a precise stroke, my blade sliced the man&#39;s throat. A deep gurgling sound, quieting the night. The others that surrounded the fire, standing horrorstruck, staring at me with apprehensive eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dealers from Detroit had asked Rowan handled both men as he deemed fit. And he had assigned me to the job. I saved the best for last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Rowan ensured Black Pea was beat down to a pulp, he ordered I took over. Finished Black Pea. He actually announced that I was his most reliable man at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only one he could trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was able to mask my shock at that announcement. Feigning indifference. I watched the entire time Black Pea was tortured. His entire face morphed into colors before my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sick grin climbed my face, as I strolled to Black Pea. Strapped, gagged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look good at all. Some of his fingers were scattered on the floor. A few teeth were out. I wasn&#39;t sure he would have looked human again, even if he did live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He whimpered, his mouth gagged. He smelled pungent. Urine. I was expressionless, watching him. Rowan wasn&#39;t looking. He was barking over the phone to another of his clients. This incident set him back a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crouching low, I leaned into Black Pea&#39;s face. I didn&#39;t mind the smell that oozed from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You remember when you had me like this. Helpless. Well revenge they say is best served cold.&#34; I snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice was dropped low for only the both of us to hear. No one knew anything but the both of us. I liked the secrecy. It gave me an edge over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I watched him, his face swollen. All purple and blue and green. A jagged gash on his right side. One eye unrecognizable, I was incensed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fact that I had joined this gang, because I was desperate to, gave none of them any rights to treat me like fuck. And they had. Seen me as a weak link they needed to take out. A spoilt brat that didn&#39;t know pain or suffering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, I knew pain. Knew the ache of betrayal. The depth humans were willing to go to ensure that their sick games continued. That they continued to oppress others. Making them plead for every bit of life. I knew now that humans wanted to always be in control. And I was never going to lose that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Control*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was forever going to be in control. Starting with taking over this tuff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out my flick blade, my new favorite weapon, the blade gleaming, I gouged out Black Pea&#39;s eyes. And finally slit his throat.</p>
