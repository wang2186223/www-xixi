                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped out of Dave&#39;s office, shocked, frightened. A good feeling nudged me. I was excited. Unable to ignore the incredulity I felt at hearing the announcement from Dave. I had never been given such a chance to come out into the spotlight. And this was a lot weird for me. All my life, I had lived it from within a box. My box, created by my own disability. I didn&#39;t see myself as a woman with an inadequacy, but it existed, nonetheless. The pity gazes I saw in others, the looks of disdain. Sometimes it was crushing and to avoid it, I just stayed within my limits. Watching from within my box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking to the café nearby, where Andrea, Mike and Rory waited for me, I wore a cheerful look. It was lunchtime, and we usually spent it here at Bloom Café. A popular cafe on this side of town, where most people attended. It was a brick and glass cafe on the outside. Surrounded by tall business buildings that towered above it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked inside and spotted them, their faces cheerful as they chatted. My gait suddenly faltered, seeing a few eyes on me. But I managed to steady my steps, reminding my inner self that they weren&#39;t gawking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The inside of the café smelled of pine wood and strong coffee. The entire decorations evoking an eco-friendly atmosphere. Hanging gardens stood above the metal beams, which served as ceilings. Even an entire wall was dedicated to beautiful flower vines. The air always smelled earthy. Not to talk of the fresh pastries that stirred strong in the air. Filling the nostrils with savory scents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, have any of you visited the club that just opened on 57th?&#34; I heard Rory announce, as I sat beside Andrea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah girls, you need to see it. Rory and I hit it and it was lit.&#34; Mike beamed, kissing Andeea. She pouted, playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe you went without me, Mike.&#34; Andrea gave him a mock scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aww baby...I and the guys wanted to see it first. Like scout the area, before we take you girls out.&#34; Mike added another kiss. I blushed, watching the two love birds. Their relationship was intense. &#34; Right Ken?&#34; Mike turned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure Mike. What ever you say.&#34; I chuckled. A waiter came by and I ordered a cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Ken. I thought you would be on my side. Remember when I took you both to a restaurant, two years ago and it turned out crap. Yeah I don&#39;t want that again. Remember I didn&#39;t have any peace because of that error?&#34; Mike chimed, his words resonating nothing in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared blankly at him. I couldn&#39;t remember any such episode. When I said nothing, the others turned worried gazes to me. Yeah, after waking up in the hospital, it turned out I now suffered some memory lapses. It was disheartening. Sometimes embarrassing, but it was a consequence of the trauma I suffered due to my fall. The doctors reassured me, when Levi and I visited the hospital for checkups that I would be fine again. But seeing the pity looks on the eyes of my friends, I felt sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh honey.&#34; Andrea held me, her embrace, warm. Her sympathy was soothing. &#34;Sorry we brought up a memory. We know the doctor suggested with time you would get better. We should be more thoughtful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught her giving a scowl to Mike. They all knew what the doctors said, from when they visited me at the hospital and at home, during those days I was recuperating. I appreciated their concern, but it was exhausting. Struggling with this dissociative amnesia thing, where I lost some personal, fun memories. Not to talk of the sympathetic looks they gave. Like I was a fragile doll. Only Levi didn&#39;t give me that look. Rather, he saw me as a strong woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile tugged my lips as I recalled his kindness to, these six weeks. Taking me to doctor&#39;s appointments. Visiting me and spending time with me, while I recuperated. Whenever he came to visit, we talked. His laugh was intoxicating, like warm butter on hot bread. I loved the way his eyes crinkled whenever I said something funny. And he was actually a good listener. I didn&#39;t even have to say much about his care skills. I mean the man was a pro with fixing a bandage. Even the nurse he hired for me had been impressed by his effective care skills. He didn&#39;t judge me or anything. Rather, he was actually relaxing to be with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your coffee, Ma&#39;am.&#34; We heard the waiter announce. I thanked the man and decided to bury myself in my cup, rather than the awkward silence that fell across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory, broke the silence first. &#34;Hey Ken. What did Dave call you in for? You were gone for sometime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped my cup and smiled. My eyes swept around the three of them, wondering how they will take the news. &#34;He said I am to be the lead dancer.&#34; I held my breath, watching their expressions. There was a pin-drop silence, their eyes wide. Then their faces morphed into elation, their cheers drowning my hushes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God! This is so cool. Congratulations darling! You deserve it!&#34; Andrea gave me another hug. I reciprocated, smiling. It was exciting actually, now that I had let it out. I believe it myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now we need to go to that club on 57th. This calls for a celebration!&#34; Rory suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I agree man. What say you, Ken? We go tonight?&#34; Mike eagerly said, his gaze anticipating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...no guys. You know how I am about these sorts of places. Clubs...parties.&#34; I argued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Ken. Enough of this.&#34; Andrea cut in, irritated. &#34;You can&#39;t live your life being sheltered in Kenya. It&#39;s time for you to live a little. Explore the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I understood her words. But I wasn&#39;t brave enough.</p>
