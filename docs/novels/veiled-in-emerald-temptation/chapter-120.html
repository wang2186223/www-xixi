Party members are confident he would deliver the agenda of the party, to New Yorkers, when he eventually emerges the winner.

                <p>Anchor man, Caleb turned to his partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They laughed and gave breakdown of the votes. I muted the channel, heading to heat up my left over meat loaf of two nights ago. I just woke up from my nap of hours ago, after work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 7pm, I was really hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After warming the food, I kicked back, watching my latest favorite soap; *Mi Corazón Es Tuyo Para Siempre.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My bell rang and I reluctantly rose to answer the door. Hank, all dressed in white short sleeved shirt and grey slacks. I shuddered at the sight of him. From fear and not desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You see after our first date, I accepted to keep seeing Hank. I had felt elated, dating such a man. I hadn&#39;t even thought twice. Andrea had doubted him, but I had reassured her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So we continued dating. Not getting intimate. Taking things slow on my request, which he willingly accepted. Surprising me, because I had thought he would find my request old-fashioned. Rather, he had agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually we went to eat at the restaurant he worked. Each staff had a discount whenever they ate there. And we always did. It grew boring by the second week, as we continued dining there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the third week, I had suggested we went to other restaurants. He had immediately flared up loudly, stunning me to silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had been outside my apartment complex, when that happened. The night, chilly, with some of my neighbors passing by. Sparing me furtive glances. He matched into his car, driving off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been shaken to the core that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliated and terrified, I had climbed up to my apartment, shutting the door. Afraid he could come back. The fury I had seen in his eyes, bewildering me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, I called him, attempting to apologize. For what exactly, I had no idea. But I had wanted to apologize nonetheless. He hadn&#39;t picked nor returned my messages. I had felt disappointed, because I had come to like him. However, I couldn&#39;t go visit him or anything, knowing I had never been to his apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was weeks ago. Now he was standing in my doorway. He had never come up to my apartment even though he knew the number. I had pleaded against it, because I was afraid of being alone with a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I come in?&#34; He asked, his tone low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had this apologetic look. I briefly considered his request and hated myself, the moment I allowed him enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was his first time in my apartment, yet he didn&#39;t even look at it with any appreciation. I frowned. Quickly dispelling the disappointment, I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry about that night. I should have called or something, but I still felt angry at you. Always telling me don&#39;t do this, do that, in this relationship.&#34; He bluntly confessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what to make of his confession. I wasn&#39;t telling him what to do. I was only trying to wait out on the right man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if he was the right man, he wouldn&#39;t be offended, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked to see him here, by the way. And I wasn&#39;t sure I was comfortable with it. I was wearing pink cotton shorts and a white &#39;H. Kitty&#39; shirt. Braless beneath the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw his eyes flick to my breasts, and I grew self-cautious. There was this unfathomable look in his eyes and it gave me mixed feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, Hank. I willI think we should just stay away for now. Perhaps it can&#39;t work out between us.&#34; I was stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked hurt and I regretted my decision. But it was for the best. I had seen girls hurt in such relationships. Guys like this, complaining about flimsy issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hurt you one minute and come back to apologize. It was narcissistic and somewhat abusive. And it was always advisable to leave such a relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t mean that, Kenya. You&#39;re just upset,&#34; he said, inching closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted back. He didn&#39;t stop. He continued, until he was in front of me. I was scared. I didn&#39;t know why he was standing there, just staring at me. He closed the space between us, tilting my chin. My eyes gazed into his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t mean what you said, because we have never done this.&#34; He looked at my lips and slowly lowered his to mine. He was taller and easily towered over me, taking me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated at first. Then, he shifted his fingers into my top and I melted into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hank smelled of cinnamon and other spices. I liked that. Intoxicating. His fingers toyed with my nipple, trailing it. Pinching. I moaned deeply, encouraging him further. He pressed himself into me. Kissing me. I shuddered. I was against a wall, and he pressed me closer. He started slipping his fingers into the waistband of my shorts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers brushed against the front of my panties. I gasped, alarmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*No, this was not happening. He was going far. We were going far.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried pulling away, his kiss grew insistent. I grew frantic. I struggled to break free. But he held me tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HankHankPlease stop.&#34; I moaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried pushing him, but he pressed closer. Grounding himself into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was confused. I didn&#39;t understand my body&#39;s reaction, why I was reacting this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dipped his fingers into my panties, roughly. I cried out. His kisses, rougher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re wet, Baby.&#34; He moaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With all my might, I shoved him off. Running to the door, opening it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of my house, Hank, this minute, or I&#39;ll scream!&#34; I threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My anger, his deception. He walked out.</p>
