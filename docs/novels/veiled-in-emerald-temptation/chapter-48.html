                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After greeting, we both fully entered the apartment, while Claudine shut the door. When we were fully seated across from each other, we discussed about a few mundane topics, while a maid came to serve us coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudine could barely hide her excitement at seeing me alone, since marriage with Levi happened. She bombarded me with a series of questions about my new life. All of which I indulgently responded to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While we sat, a handsome man around Claudine&#39;s age, emerged from the other side of the hallway, his presence startling me. He was dressed in a white T shirt and black sweat pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tad Darling, this is my friend and employee, Mrs Ruthford that I informed you would be coming to see me later. Just give us a few minutes and I would be joining you.&#34; Claudine smiled, flirtatiously. I gave a furtive glance, as I watched the mood between them. A flood of heat washed over me, as I realized that I had just interrupted lovers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Baby.&#34; Tad smiled, blowing Claudine a kiss. &#34;Mrs Ruthford, nice to meet you. And congratulations on your recent nuptials.&#34; His eyes danced appreciatively, as he walked to collect a drink from the kitchen, before he finally returned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about that.&#34; Claudine apologized, focusing her attention on me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no. I should be the one apologizing. I just interrupted something important between&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya honey.&#34; Claudine took my palms in hers. &#34;Relax. Tad and I arewell. We&#39;re just starting something new. It&#39;s no worries. We&#39;ve got all the time to get to know each other. I don&#39;t like rushing these things.&#34; Claudine smiled, slyly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to rein in my emotions as I heard those words. My eyes secretly catching the excitement in Claudine&#39;s eyes. And pain gnawed in me, seeing that my mission for coming was soon to extinguish that excitement in the woman&#39;s eyes. I knew that Claudine had been in affairs since her divorce, but I had never met anyone of them. Seeing Tad now, only made me reconsider my reasons for coming here, because I didn&#39;t want to cause the woman any unhappiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what was it you wanted to see me about?&#34; Claudine broke into my thoughts. I hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see the work going on at J&#39;aime. It&#39;s remarkable. Turning the entire building into two floors, complete with a modern fire exit. I can&#39;t wait to see it completed and it&#39;s all because of you, darling. You are that light that made Levi give us this great opportunity.&#34; Claudine beamed, holding my palms in hers, affectionately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inwardly groaned, my body growing rigid at those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is my reason for coming here.&#34; I blurted out, my eyes holding Claudine&#39;s. The other woman&#39;s gaze grew sharp as she silently watched me. Inhaling abruptly, my nerves calming, I started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The authorities have evidence against you, on how you defrauded your ex-husband, Jimmy and the insurance company, to get your fortune.&#34; I watched as Claudine pulled her hands away, nervously, her eyes filled with horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is that if I don&#39;t do what I have to now, you and everyone at J&#39;aime, would suffer, immensely. No employment for the staff. And for you, jail term. I don&#39;t want that for any of you. The evidence against you, is like a guillotine hanging over my head, waiting for me to make a mistake.&#34; I cried, my voice soft. All the torture I had felt for days, surging through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught Claudine give me a guarded look, as she heard me cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it Levi? Is it your husband, Kenya?&#34; Claudine drew closer to me, holding me comfortingly. I fixed red rimmed eyes to Claudine and fell into her arms, bursting into tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, honey. Am so sorry about this. That was the reason for the rushed marriage and the building renovation and everything.&#34; Claudine held me, soothing me. I shuddered, weighing my response. I wondered how much she had deduced. My constant anxiety, the night of the reception and my reluctance to show excitement about the wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he abusing you?&#34; Claudine asked, suspiciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no. He isn&#39;t I can&#39;t tell you anything more, Claudine. I just&#34; I shook, inwardly. I pulled away from the embrace and took my time to gather my thoughts. I had come too far now to turn back. And the last thing I needed, was weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have spoken to my lawyer and she has done the necessary paper work. Papers, which will allow all liabilities of J&#39;aime to be transferred to me. The existing arrangements will remain of course. I would only work based on what has existed on ground. All you have to do is accept my offer. And the she would take it over from there.&#34; I breathed, rising and walking to stand by a window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gazed below and watched as the cars still drove in the pouring rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would buy J&#39;aime from you. But I would make you an equal partner, where you would receive the dividends as expected, monthly. The only additional change would be you leaving, moving to another location and never return. Leaving me to bear whatever comes,&#34; I sternly said, turning to face Claudine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claudine fixed a steady gaze on me, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Claudine asked, skeptically. Her brows creased together, thoughtfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am saying that all he has to do is give a call and your life would be ruined. But with this idea, I&#39;d be relieving you of certain ruination from Levi. He can ruin you, but he can&#39;t ruin me, because it would destroy his name... You always told me you had an undisclosed home in Switzerland. Why don&#39;t you go there? Move in there permanently. I have asked that an offshore account be opened for you, so that every profit earned, would reach you. In that case, Levi would never know your whereabouts. I wouldn&#39;t speak, if you don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
