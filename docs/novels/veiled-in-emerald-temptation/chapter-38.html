                <p>***Levi***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am so proud that you finally remarried.&#34; Henry muttered, after swallowing some brandy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were in my office, the music from the ballroom down the corridor, filtering in. I nodded, grinning. The office was manly, smelling of polished leather and fine wood. My preference. The soft golden light, offered an opulent air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After Belle, everyone thought you had sealed your fate against marriage forever. And Kenya is wonderful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks man. That means alot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome. She is a keeper, Levi. Take care of her.&#34; Henry warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did any of my cousins or any of our buddies come?&#34; Henry asked, after a considerable pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, the Sullivans made it. Clark Sullivan stopped by earlier, but Harrison RSVP&#39;d about other engagements.&#34; I sipped my brandy. Henry had an enviable close knit relationship with his family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Liam?&#34; Henry asked, keenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled. &#34;The moment Liam learnt that his father, Kennedy Copeland and his ilk, were invited, he just buzzed out. We can always see each other, it&#39;s no issue.&#34; We both laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Albert?&#34; Henry carefully asked. I paused my sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Bethel*? Why ask?&#34; I questioned, puzzled. Albert Bethel, a social recluse, never attended these social gatherings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitantly, Henry revealed. &#34;I recently found out that we are cousins. A cousin to my late biological mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Who? Marseilles?* But your mother is alive?&#34; I asked, confused. Did I miss something? Last I checked his mum, Marseilles still lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock came on the door, and I irritatedly asked the person in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benjamin.&#34; I froze, seeing Benjamin in the doorway. It was like I had seen a ghost. His face, identical to Belle. I shuddered at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello Ruthford. Did you miss my name on your guest list?&#34; Benjamin asked, menacingly as he approached. His blonde hair shone under the light as he haughtily stopped before me. I had deliberately omitted his name from the guest list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Funny that I had to do last minute preparations to get here.&#34; He spat coldly. I stared at him. Refusing to let him bait me into an argument concerning this issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Henry, this is Benjamin Moore. Twin to my late wife, Belle.&#34; I introduced, quietly, my eyes locked with Benjamin&#39;s. All dressed for the evening, he looked impressive. I turned to Henry, who had a raised brow as our eyes met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Benjamin, my friend Henry Macklesfield.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin spared Henry an imperceptible nod, before he turned back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d leave you both alone, while I go check our wives.&#34; Henry supplied as he sensed the tension. I nodded appreciatively to him, as he exited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone at last. &#34;Care for a drink?&#34; I asked, tightly, as I went to fetch some brandy into two glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did I have to find out from the media about your wedding, Ruthford?&#34; Benjamin&#39;s voice was dark behind me. I ignored him and poured the drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I extended one to him, he received it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a sip, I replied. &#34;I owe you no explanations, Benjamin. I had indulged your opposition to my moving on, because I hadn&#39;t found any woman worthy. My marrying Kenya isn&#39;t any of your concern.&#34; I watched Benjamin&#39;s face grimace at my words. Betrayal or hurt. I couldn&#39;t say. What was he expecting, that I&#39;d sit forever? Mourning a woman who hadn&#39;t even been worth my love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want you to embarrass me, like you did countless times when you saw with women after Belle&#39;s death. It has nothing to do with Belle. But everything to do with my life.&#34; I was furious, but managed to hold my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benjamin sipped the drink, his face expressionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Years ago, when you came to marry my sister, I knew you were untrustworthy. But my parents had accepted you. Because they respected your restoration of your family name. But I saw through you.&#34; Benjamin uttered. I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a shame dad and mum died, before all this. I know you had something to do with my sister&#39;s death. But I can&#39;t prove it. And so you walk the earth free, while Belle is 6 ft below ground.&#34; Benjamin accused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared, wanting to retort. But I chose not to succumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had known that their greed for my new money and fame had led them to accept my marriage with Belle. Because the Moores had been one of the families that had abandoned us, years ago. But I had married their daughter for my political endorsement. And I had fallen for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strolling away from Benjamin, I walked to a shelf that held books and some little figurines. The figurines had been gifts from Belle on our first Christmas as a couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? You can&#39;t answer, because you know my words mirror the truth?&#34; Raw bitterness accompanied those words from Benjamin. It was childish , discussing this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, I spoke. &#34;Move past this, Benjamin. Someday, I hope you will find peace concerning this. As for my marriage, I have a wife to return to. I wouldn&#39;t want to keep her nor my guests waiting long.&#34; I stared, hoping this ended here. I came closer to him. &#34;You can stay for the rest of the party, If you wish. But please don&#39;t cause a scene for my wife...&#34; Kenya didn&#39;t need all this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed bitterly. &#34;Wife? Or you mean the helpless invalid you have paraded for all the world to see.&#34; Benjamin sneered. I stared at him, horror struck. Blood rushing in my head. My ears pumped. &#34;She would never replace my sister...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fist instantly connected with Benjamin&#39;s jaw before the next words came out. My blood boiled within me. Rage fueling me. *He dared compare both women*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fumed as I punched him until his blood mingled with mine. I didn&#39;t even hear any one come in. Only the ringing rage in my ears. And then I felt her hand hold mine. She whimpered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I stilled, turning to face the eyes of the only woman that could calm me.</p>
