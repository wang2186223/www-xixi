                <p>***Present day, Two days later***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I strolled into an art gallery in Manhattan for an exhibition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guests, all dressed, were present to watch new artists, showcasing what they called *Gen Z Art pieces*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rows and rows of art works, representing the modern artists, who did their works on the computer rather than on paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Saturday and I only honored the invitation, because I needed anything to distract me from my worries. It was four days and still no word from Levi. I was frustrated but managed to fake smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to Levi&#39;s status, we were supposed to attend. However, in his absence, I had to represent him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a sleeveless black dress and blue suede, heels, my hair braided in cornrows, I looked beautiful. A pair of diamond earrings accentuated my look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sipping from my glass of sparkling champagne, the entire gallery busy, I bumped into someone. Hastily looking up, I discovered I had splashed my drink on a very handsome;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alec Cruso&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wide smile followed my words. That dimple again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;KenyaHi&#34; He greeted, ecstatically. Instantly holding me in a warm embrace. For a moment we both ignored the fact that I had spilled my drink on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have you been?&#34; He pulled away, looking straight at me. I lowered my eyes to his very fancy white blazer, which was stained. He followed my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never mind the stain.&#34; He urged. &#34;So tell me, how is married life treating you?&#34; He asked, staring into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally managed to get my thoughts around the fact that I was seeing Alec again after five years. Last I heard he was schooling in England; his father&#39;s birth country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marriage is fine, Alec. And you, how is England?&#34; I asked. It was like I was in that night of prom again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Banishing the awful feeling, I inhaled shakily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen you in like years, only for me to find out you are married to one of the renowned billionaires in the world.&#34; He stared at me with such intrigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I liked that I was now fascinating to him. No longer that girl, who was humiliated on prom night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, I turned to absently stare at an art piece in front of us. &#34;I know, right?&#34; I said. &#34;I was surprised by it all as well.&#34; Thoughts of Levi came flooding again. I dispelled the worry. I had faith he was fine. He was just busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what brought you back to the States? Are you through with school?&#34; I asked. Another waiter passed and I grabbed a glass of wine. Alec eyed me warily and I smiled, remorsefully. He chuckled in acknowledgement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in medical school, so not finished yet. I came here to attend my sister&#39;s wedding next Saturday.&#34; He informed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded in understanding. I never met his sister. She was ten years older than us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s great. Amber, right? I never met her,&#34; I said, turning to face him. I barely saw any of the art pieces. My mind was just drifting in an out of Levi and this pleasant meeting, that suddenly stood as a distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;d extend you and your husband an invitation, so that you can finally meet her.&#34; He excitedly offered. I nodded. He still held this charm about him. He was now more fit, mature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look beautiful.&#34; Alec remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared, astonished. *Wow. Alec saw me beautiful now*. *Could he be the mystery K.C? Funny I hadn&#39;t even chatted with him since Levi and I grew close*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shyly, I lowered my eyes. I suddenly didn&#39;t want any other man to find me beautiful. It sounded better coming out from Levi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding weakly, I turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am sorry if I overstepped. II just couldn&#39;t hide the truth,&#34; he said, regretfully. I didn&#39;t want to tell him it was okay, when he had never seen me as such. It wasn&#39;t okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a clean shaven face. His blonde hair, cropped low. I felt his unease at my silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you say the wedding was next Saturday?&#34; I asked, to ease the awkward tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; He breathed. I felt the heat of him, as he drew close. I didn&#39;t like his warmth. I didn&#39;t like him being close. I wanted only Levi. I turned abruptly to escape his invasion and bumped into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec steadied me, his hand on the small of my back. A soft pressure there. But I still felt it and it was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently, I pulled away from his hold. I looked into his eyes and saw something there. I recognized it. I had seen it in Levi before. *Desire*. I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go,&#34; I whispered. He lowered his gaze to my lips, my breath hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning his lips in, he whispered back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That night at Prom, I wanted to kiss you. But I couldn&#39;t, because Daisy interrupted us. I wanted to be your first true kiss, Kenya.&#34; He eyes held mine and I am sure he saw my shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had heard the rumors then of me paying for my first kiss. And he wanted to be my first true kiss. I didn&#39;t know if I should feel shame or joy. I saw an intensity in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years I had crushed on Alec. I had desired his embrace, his heated gaze on me. Now that I was married, five years after high school, he was saying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly wondered why he hadn&#39;t defended me that night from Daisy, if he had liked me. Why he never said anything to me. He never called me after that night. That night, students had gathered and watched the scene. Watched Daisy taunt me and he said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chester had come around and had dispersed them. Dragging me off and into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you felt this way back then, why didn&#39;t you defend me that night?&#34; His face changed to shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I was afraid of my dad.&#34;</p>
