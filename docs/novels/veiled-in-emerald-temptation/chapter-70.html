                <p>***Kenya***.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated that such disdain, made me cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should have been used to it by now; the looks of contempt from others, whenever I was introduced as his wife. But today, I felt hurt. Perhaps because of the woman&#39;s beauty. Or my inferiority. *Damn it.* I was a mess. I dabbed my eyes again for the hundredth time, since I entered the ladies&#39; room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone buzzed from Kirsten&#39;s incoming text. We were chatting. Since that night we met, we grew closer and I even asked that we visited them, perhaps next month. I wanted to see her. I really missed her presence. She was like this elder sister I never had. Not that Amanda wasn&#39;t great. She was. But with Kirsten, I wasn&#39;t superficial. I was me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Kirsten: You&#39;re beautiful, Kenya. Don&#39;t feel inferior before Mona. Trust me when I tell you our husbands were the hottest, before their marriage. We&#39;re talking of the most eligible bachelors. Well, yours was a widower. Yet, hot.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed, sitting on a stool in front of a mirror. There were rows of stools before the ornate mirrors. The entire room was lavish. Pink and gold decorations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Then why did he marry me, if His Royal Hotness, knew his reputation. He should have ended up with Mona or something. You should have seen her face. It was like I died and smelled bad 🤢***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya.&#34; I heard Levi&#39;s voice as he knocked. I startled. *Why was he knocking the ladies&#39; room? Was he going to come in?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am in here.&#34; I answered. Silence followed, before I heard footsteps. He was gone. I lowered my focus to my phone again and then the door barged open, with Levi coming in. I started at the unexpectedness, while he locked the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Levi? What are you doing here?&#34; I asked, wide eyed. He turned to me, his eyes raking me over. Then without another word, he strolled over and kissed me hungrily. He didn&#39;t break, he didn&#39;t pause, he just groped me, kissing me. I was surprised, my mind assimilating, while I matched his kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hungry, maddening. Need laced beneath and I delved in it. My phone slipping and shattering. Mona forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ground my hips into his hardness, earning a smile from him, while we kissed. He slipped his hands into my top, which I had changed into before we left the beach house, tweaking my nipples. I ached from the touch. My body on fire. I bit my lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if someone comes in.&#34; I asked, hazy. He kissed my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tipped some people. This is our domain until you are drenched and pulsing for me.&#34; He smiled, slyly. I moaned, as he intensified the pressure on my nipples. He sucked my nipples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;LeviI can&#39;t wait.&#34; I called hastily. My breath rapid. &#34;I need you.&#34; I called, slipping clumsy fingers between us, until I found his fly. I unzipped and let out his hard cock. He already had some precum for me. He wanted me, as well. Without another word, I shifted my panties and just lowered myself unto him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain. I cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re still new to this Baby. Still tight. Let me guide you.&#34; He urged, gently. I nodded, allowing him toy with me. Fanning me in strokes with his deft fingers, until I was wet and dripping for him. Then he pushed himself into me, until he was buried to the hilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving gently, his hips thrusting to set the pace, I rolled. Panting from the pleasure, the pain that rippled through me. I cried, moaned and clutched him. Not wanting to let him go. Tears in my eyes, from the pain, the sweetness. Not to talk of the unexpectedness and excitement at being taken by my dangerous husband in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pinched my nipples, kissing my lips, taking in my cries. He wasn&#39;t in a hurry. His only focus was me, my satisfaction in his arms. I suddenly wondered if he had pleasured the likes of Mona. If he had taken them here. The thoughts, shuttered me. But he ground me deeper into him and I was pliant again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes locked with his. And what I saw there was beautiful. Levi&#39;s eyes centered on me. My pleasure, my release. My excitement. His gaze wasn&#39;t locked on any other woman. He was here, adoring my body. Decorating it with his kisses, his juice. Impaling it with his hard erection. His body reacting to my touch. His lips flooding me, until I was mindless. And there was no greater pleasure than that. No greater satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Levi, I found my release. My need. In him, I was just me. He took me at a pace, which I was comfortable with. He considered my passion, putting it far above his. And I couldn&#39;t find anything better. Even though his life held some mystery, he was my mystery to unravel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our bodies synchronized in pleasure, I found my release, crying his name inside his mouth. He swallowed my voice, pressing us into a deep kiss. Soon, he thrust one last time, his own guttural cry, buried in our kiss, as he came. His body throbbed inside me and I smiled satisfactorily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing one kiss on my lips, he leaned back and watch me from heated eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look extremely beautiful after a good fucking, Mrs Ruthford.&#34; His smile was teasing, his voice, sultry. I smiled shyly at his naughtiness. I didn&#39;t even have a comeback. Seeing my awkwardness, he chuckled and kissed me long and hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, let&#39;s go home and finish this.&#34; He dangled, his lips quirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what about Mona. I thought you were with her earlier?&#34; I asked, biting myself for even bringing that up. But I couldn&#39;t help it. Somehow, I still felt the weight of insecurity clamping me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised a brow, staring into my eyes, as I still remained disheveled in his laps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mona was my past. You are my wife.&#34;</p>
