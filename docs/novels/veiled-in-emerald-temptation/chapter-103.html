                <p>Three days to the reopening and I was cracking under pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know how to handle all these public events. I lied to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still not a word from Levi and Blake, I couldn&#39;t manage my emotions anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recalled my dream days ago. Him coming to me and saying, &#39;Baby, am home.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had woken up thinking he had returned. Disappointed when I didn&#39;t see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to file a report with the police, but I had no idea what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Hi, I haven&#39;t heard from my husband in days, since he went on a business trip. Could you help me find him?***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Police: Alright Ma&#39;am. Where did he go on a trip?***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know anything about him***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sank on the floor, overwhelmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, what are you doing on the floor.&#34; A familiar voice reached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed the sound, my eyes falling on mum. Not minding my employees, I embraced her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummum&#34; I cried. Tears pouring from my eyes. I didn&#39;t even see Alan, standing behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Ken.&#34; He greeted. I raised my head, smiling at him. His eyes appreciatively took in the place. Mum&#39;s arms were wrapped around me and I didn&#39;t want them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did well with the place. And look at the decorations. I wish Amanda could come.&#34; Alan regretfully added. I frowned at his statement, looking at mum. My eyes still had tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amanda is stressed these days and the doctor asked her to rest.&#34; Mum informed. My scowl deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why doesn&#39;t anyone ever tell me anything in this family? It&#39;s like am just not part of you.&#34; I grumbled, hurt. It was like I was being deliberately left out by everyone. Levi, Amanda, mum, Alan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mum eyed me, critically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come for the party, ladies. I&#39;ve got business to attend to before then. Kenya, mum in law&#39;s bag is here. She didn&#39;t fail to inform me that she wanted to stay in your house this time.&#34; Alan announced. I turned to mum, surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I&#39;ve stayed with Amanda and Alan before, it&#39;s time to stay with you.&#34; Mum smiled. I smiled too. Happy that I&#39;d have company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alan left, I took mum on a tour around the school. Her eyes wide with amazement at every turn. She didn&#39;t fail to ask questions, when she deemed it necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met my friends, Andrea and Mike. She had never really met them before, because I always kept my family life private. They loved her immediately and promised to come have her famous tarts tomorrow. I couldn&#39;t stop smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a welcome distraction from all the ache I felt, not hearing from Levi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was lunch, I ordered pizza for everyone. Mum said all the extra cheese I ordered in mine, would make me lose my figure and I laughed at her concern. She always complained about my extra cheese.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we sat down to eat, she told me so much about my sister and I grew worried for her. She said Amanda kept on mumbling about something she had to confess in her sleep. And Alan kinda grew worried. Whenever he asked her about it, she&#39;d just deny it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a concern.&#34; I breathed. I recalled how she acted when we came for her party. I wish she&#39;d pick my calls; I would have called her. But since we returned from the party, she just grew silent on me. Even when I initiated chats with her, she&#39;d just read them and ignore me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what to make of Amanda&#39;s issue. And I didn&#39;t want to add to mum&#39;s worries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That reminds me, how is Levi. I haven&#39;t heard from him in days. Is he on a trip?&#34; Mum asked. My heart sank, not knowing what to say. She watched me and grew alarmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no, don&#39;t tell me you had a fight.&#34; She muttered, covering her mouth. &#34;Honey, you don&#39;t need to fight the man, he is a good heart.&#34; Mum declared in his defense. I laughed inwardly, knowing mum loved all her in laws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s fine mum. He went on a business trip in a remote place. So he is out of coverage.&#34; I was lying. But if I didn&#39;t, she&#39;d plague me, until I spoke my truth and both of us will be drowned in grief and worry. And I didn&#39;t need that. I heard her exhale with relief and I equally did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Going for something distracting, I pulled up a different topic, just to ease the both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later at night, mum cooked a nice dinner of rice and spicy vegetables, my favorite. Even the staff had to eat mum&#39;s dinner. They were amazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she grew tired, I sat with her on the bed, until she finally fell asleep. I was happy she was around. It was cute having my mum around for once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the room, so she could sleep peacefully. She kept on praising the beauty of the penthouse. Said it was very magnificent. I wondered what she would say about the Ruthford mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking to the stairs, the housekeeper came up to me with the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, it&#39;s a call from Mr Dickson,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hastily, I grabbed the phone and walked to a corner to answer. My hands shook as I hesitantly brought the phone to my ear. I was worried, Blake calling instead of Levi. But I managed to calm myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blake?&#34; I shakily called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs Ruthford. Good evening Ma&#39;am. How are you?&#34; Blake calmly said. It was a good sign. He was calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am fine Blake. I have been calling you both and no response,&#34; I said. He paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were caught up in meetings. Am sorry about that, Ma&#39;am.&#34; He apologized, ruefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright. How is my husband? Is he there?&#34; I asked, dispelling the fear that suddenly swamped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Silence*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart thudded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have faith, Mrs Ruthford.&#34;</p>
