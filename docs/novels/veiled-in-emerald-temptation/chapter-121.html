                <p>***Kenya.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Present day, three days later***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Thursday afternoon. The weather, mildly warm and I allowed myself enjoy it, Alec and I strolled in a nearby park. Our hands accidentally touched, as we walked. But I didn&#39;t mind. Made me feel valued, by this simple man..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since that day at Lake restaurant, we grew closer. Calling and messaging each other more often. We talked about everything. He was a living picture of peace that I wanted to embrace. The kind of warmth I had yearned for most of my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I even missed over my dreams of marrying a doctor, when I was younger. But things were different now, I was married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something wrong?&#34; Alec said beside me. I grew sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; I didn&#39;t want to dwell in my sadness. I didn&#39;t want to be cruel by ruining this moment for us. I stood, my body missing Levi&#39;s touch. The scent of earth, reminding me of his earthy perfume. I instantly wished to push him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I ask you a favor?&#34; I looked into his eyes. I was hesitant, but I knew I needed to get Levi out of my system. It had been days since we were last together and I needed him. I missed him. And I hated me for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything.&#34; Alec smiled. *Oh that smile*. Mesmerizing. I needed to drown myself in it , or be reduced to ashes, because I craved who I didn&#39;t want to have. *Levi*.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you kiss me?&#34; I breathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have sounded desperate, pathetic. However, I didn&#39;t mind. Anything that could erase the feel of Levi against my lips, against my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec watched me silently for seconds. His eyes unfathomable. I suddenly regretted my stupid request. I had just gone and ruined everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to ease the awkward silence, I hastily said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, Alec. I don&#39;t know what I was thinking. Perhaps it&#39;s the&#34; I paused, flushing with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around, not wanting to hear anything from Alec. Though he didn&#39;t even move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively I crossed the lawn, putting distance between us. He didn&#39;t call me nor stop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t even wanted him to. The look in his eyes had given enough away. Revulsion. Embarrassment. I was a pathetic woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been crushing over him for years in high school. As a married woman now, I allowed my current circumstances foil my better judgement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arrived my hotel room in a few minutes. I didn&#39;t allow myself cry in the cab, because I barely knew the reason I was hurt. Shooting was ending in a week and I&#39;d be expected to face my life. End this promenade with my freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slumped in bed, pulling out my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>K. C&#39;s message popped on the notification bar. We had been discussing ways in which a couple satisfied each other, without having the other half present. He suggested toys and stuff, earlier. But I had argued against it. I had recalled Levi&#39;s sex play on me, weeks ago in the cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***K.C: Should I teach you?***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the message, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Me: Teach me what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***K.C: Pleasuring yourself without toys. You didn&#39;t seem to like the idea earlier.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stiffened. Pushing the phone face down on the mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only time I had pleasured myself, was when Levi had asked me to. It had felt good. Adding to the ecstasy I had felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I was being propositioned to do it by another man. *Wasn&#39;t that being unfaithful to Levi?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body instantly grew warm to the thought. My nipples ached. My breath picked up. The thought taking root inside me, as I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***K.C: I wouldn&#39;t bite. I&#39;d be gentle.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lower lip, nursing the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*What was he going to do?*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if I didn&#39;t do this, I would continue to ache for Levi. And if I did, I&#39;d have release, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Would I find release?***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***K.C: If you trust me.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trust. The last man I trusted, turned out to be a killer. A monster from a monster. I was trapped. Caught between my need for release and my need for self-preservation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, my need won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Show me.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause and I saw his typing bubble again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***K.C: Take off your clothes. Everything, until you are naked.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was ridiculous. I was obeying a man I barely knew. Never met him and I was going to phone sex him? But I found I welcomed the thought. It was intriguing. Daring. Rebellious. A distraction from my humiliation with Alec.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I complied. Down to my skin, cold. I slipped behind the covers. Another message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***K.C: My lips are trailing your skin. Your lips. Your neck. I am climbing back up to your lips. My fingers tweaking your nipples. Touch those spots I called. And in that order.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers shook as I obeyed. Touching my lips, my neck. My nipples. I gasped. A cool, sweet tremor climbing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: Okay. Done.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***K.C: Don&#39;t respond. Only when you finally have your release. Now, knead your nipples, pinch them, until you cry the name of the one you want. Me.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched my nipples. Pressed them, until my nipples were sore. And a warm wetness, pooled inside my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was madness, but I liked it. Levi&#39;s face kept flashing across my mind. Pleasuring me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I let it. K.C&#39;s messages continued. And I went on, until he asked me to touch my nether regions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched my clit, my entrance. Circling, pressing. My clit rigid, my entrance pooled with cum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried, dipping my finger. Mimicking Levi&#39;s thrusts. Slow, fast. This wasn&#39;t about me and K. C anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was with Levi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His touches sending me to a frenzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried his name, my clit burning. A pressure quickening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, my release found me. I was breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calm again, I typed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***Me: I came.***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>***K.C: Whose face did you see?***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t answer.</p>
