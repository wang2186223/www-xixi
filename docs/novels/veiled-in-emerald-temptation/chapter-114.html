                <p>***Two weeks later***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi had been correct about one thing. I suffered withdrawals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, his prediction had omitted one detail; *my stubbornness.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I succumbed to him that first night, two weeks ago, I knew I was doomed. Rather than allow myself suffer his seductions anymore, I had remedied it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Early the next morning, I got up. Asking the driver to take me to the Ruthford mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Levi hadn&#39;t come after me, even though I was certain he had known my whereabouts. He just let me be. I must confess I had found that comforting, knowing I didn&#39;t have to confront my hate for him, every day. Knowing I didn&#39;t have to breathe in the same air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even mind the distance I had to cover every day, coming to work. It was easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We barely attended public appearances together. And I think people were already talking. Yet I didn&#39;t bother. I don&#39;t think he did either. I believe it was easier for him, not facing guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t blame him for his father&#39;s actions. I didn&#39;t even judge him. But I couldn&#39;t ignore the fact that he had learned such a crucial information about his father&#39;s atrocities, and had chosen to sweep it off. Banishing it, like it never happened. Obviously that was the reason that person claimed the Journalist had gone missing. And I could bet that he was responsible for that. He hadn&#39;t even attempted to console the victims&#39; families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that was my issue. His own faults. Why did he have to succumb to such heights like his father had. Why did he have to go to such extremities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wondered what happened to his first wife. I didn&#39;t know anything about him and I feared him. He was my nightmare come to pass. The boogey man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya. We&#39;ve gathered the older kids. What time do we audition them?&#34; Andrea&#39;s voice came through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raised my eyes to her. It was September and we needed to begin auditions for the kids that were to participate in *Thorns.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The school was finally in full session. Classes were every Saturday, except during holidays, when they attended three times a week. Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. I was hoping that as time progressed, days will be added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty male and female kids in all; ranging from ages 7 to 16. I needed my mind together to work, or else, I was going to make mistakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just give me a minute Andy. Let me finish with this email.&#34; I was sending an email to Alan&#39;s production team, in regard to my proposed date of arrival. I was checking in tomorrow, Sunday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shooting was beginning in Baltimore on Monday the 16th and I needed to check in my flight itinerary with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally looked at the scripts, weeks ago, I had felt excited knowing we were shooting in Baltimore. I had even nursed the idea of seeing Alec, while I was around. The only problem was I wasn&#39;t certain how he would take me checking up on him. Well it couldn&#39;t hurt to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was late into 4pm, before we finished assessing the students. All very impressive students, I couldn&#39;t be prouder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Classes dismissed for the day, we sat to deliberate on the students to be selected. They were all very talented kids and it hurt to know that only the best was needed for the show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going to happen to the other kids that aren&#39;t selected? Wouldn&#39;t that break their hearts?&#34; One of the tutors asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had already considered that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will encourage them to work hard. Reminding them that we are not only in this for the winnings. We are also here to have fun and socialize.&#34; I smiled at the tutor. She seemed to welcome my suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would also add, if you don&#39;t mind,&#34; Andrea said. We turned to her. &#34;Can we organize a different show of our own, so that all the other kids can participate. Something simple and fun. An encouragement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought about the idea. It was excellent and the kids will definitely feel a sense of welcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That would be nice, Andrea. I&#39;d leave that to you. Do you have a show in mind?&#34; I asked. She smiled, enthusiastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A Nutcracker&#39;s Christmas.&#34; She beamed, barely able to contain herself. I nodded in appreciation and we talked on how to begin the routines for rehearsals of both shows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone in my office, preparing to depart, so I could go rest for my flight tomorrow, I picked up my phone and texted K. C. I hadn&#39;t heard from him in a while and I suddenly felt like chatting with anyone but Levi. He didn&#39;t respond. So I took out my phone and Alec&#39;s card and dialed his number. It rang and on the second ring, he picked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cruso here.&#34; His voice came over the phone. I stilled. *God what was I to say*? I grew nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; His voice came again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alec. Hi. It&#39;s Kenya.&#34; I breathed. God I was nervous. There was a brief silence, before he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kenya. I never expected you to callActually I waited and almost gave up,&#34; he quietly said. I allowed his voice warm me. I still found him attractive even after all these years. Perhaps my recent hurt pushed me to seek comfort in someone normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was busy. Sorry.&#34; I apologized. He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay. Happy you finally called. This your number?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Didn&#39;t my name show?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No This is actually my office number you picked. My cell is the second number.&#34; He corrected. I laughed, nervously. I was silly. I hadn&#39;t even noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to inform you that I&#39;d be coming to Baltimore tomorrow. Is there a chance we can hook up, while am there? Perhaps show me around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Certainly,&#34; he enthusiastically said. I felt relieved, delighted. &#34;Just give me a call when you arrive and I&#39;d give you a memorable September.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
