                <p>Brody finally made it back to land with the boat. I stay in my seat as I watch him grumble about me.</p>

                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lucky you&#39;re our future Luna and I like you or else I would throw you right back in,&#34; he says taking his shirt off. I walk over to him and he shakes his hair off on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey watch it I&#39;m finally dry waiting for you to cross the rest of the lake,&#34; I say slapping him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well this wouldn&#39;t happen if you didn&#39;t leave me stranded,&#34; he says throwing his shirt on me. I groan because now my shirt is wet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brodyyy,&#34; I groan. He gives me a smirk and then starts taking his shorts off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woah there hi behind the trees,&#34; I say pointing to the cluster of trees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oops sorry,&#34; he says quickly running over to the trees. He comes out wearing fresh clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we go hunting because I promised my wolf we would find some deer or something,&#34; I ask him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just changed,&#34; he groaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh well,&#34; I say. I let my wolf come forward tearing the clothes in the process. I sit back and let her do her thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do I even bother,&#34; I heard Brody mumble. I heard bones crack but we didn&#39;t wait for him. She took off following the scent of the fresh meat of a group of deers. We couldn&#39;t hear anything but our paws hitting the forest floor as we ran looking for them. The leaves crunch as we run towards the scent. She starts to slow down as the scent gets stronger. There was a group of about 10 deers. She crouched behind the bushes and spotted a large female near the bush and set her eyes on it. She slowly inched her way towards the deer. She turned her head the other way and it was a mistake. She pounced from where she was hiding and she aimed for her neck. She was about to make contact but it never came. There was a large impact on my side and my back hit my tree. I looked at what happened and saw a gray, almost white, wolf next to me. The pain in my back caused me to shift back to skin. My wolf was pissed at this other wolf for making her catch get away. I groan in pain from the impact of the tree. I felt blood rush down my back and a lot of my leg was scratched up as I tried to sit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my god Sophia are you okay,&#34; I heard Titus&#39; voice ask. It hit me that Titus was the one that hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do,&#34; I growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was going for the deer but then I saw you and I tried to stop but I couldn&#39;t,&#34; He explained. He got up and ran towards the nearest rock and gave me a shirt. The back of the shirt stuck to me because of the blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I say pushing him away as he tries to look at my injuries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not the fucking pain made you shift back,&#34; he growled back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare growl at me you&#39;re the one that caused them and I&#39;ve had worse.&#34; Guilt flooded his face and his eyes seemed to soften.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me just get you home so I can bandage your back. I think my claws dug some of your fur out and I think I bit your leg,&#34; he says standing up and holding out his hand for me. I got up without his help and tried walking but the pain was too much. I hissed in pain and my legs buckled as I tried to take another step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you so stubborn let me help you,&#34; he says from behind me. I sighed in defeat as he walked over to me. He couldn&#39;t carry me bridal style because of my back. He grabs my arms and wraps it around his neck. The sparks that it gave made it almost unbearable to be mad at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jump,&#34; he whispered into my ear. It sent shivers down my spine. I jump and he grabs me a little too close to my butt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch your hands,&#34; I say slapping him. He mumbles a &#39;sorry&#39;. I wrap my legs around him and rest my head on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget you&#39;re not wearing shorts,&#34; he whispers. Shit, I wasn&#39;t wearing anything down there. All the blood in my body rushed to my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just get back quickly please,&#34; I whisper. I felt his back shiver a bit. It was nice to know I have that effect on him. I turn around and see the house come into view and I let out a mental sigh. He walks up the stairs and opens the door. I tried to put my leg down but he didn&#39;t let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m mostly healed now you can let me go,&#34; I mumble. It was true my wolf sped up my healing on the trip here but he still held a tight grip on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Titus,&#34; I growled lowly. He didn&#39;t budge his hands held me near him still. He let go of me and I landed on the kitchen counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay here and let me get the med kit,&#34; he says. I wanted to move but my wolf pushed me to stay back so that our mate could take care of us. I grumbled internally and stayed waiting for him. He came back and set the med kit next to me. He opened it and took the antibacterial out. He took the cotton buds out and put the liquid on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is going to sting,&#34; he says grabbing my leg. He started to clean my wounds out and I flinched a little. I let out a low growl as he kept cleaning it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I&#39;m sorry but you don&#39;t want an infection,&#34; he apologizes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Alpha called me by the way,&#34; he randomly brought up as he continued to clean the gashes he made in my leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait what? Why want I informed till now?&#34; I ask as I try to fight back the sting in my leg. Why only know it&#39;s been almost 2 weeks now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well they called Today and Jacob picked up and may have told them that you were here and they are making a trip here tomorrow,&#34; he says now wrapping my leg in gauze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait what?&#34; I said grabbing his hand. The sparks flew up my arm when our skin touched. I almost let go but my wolf watered more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You invited my Alpha to come see me?&#34; I said slowly with my wolf&#39;s voice coming through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down Sophia. I didn&#39;t Jacob did and he&#39;s no longer your Alpha,&#34; he growled lowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then who&#39;s coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Beta And Beta female and future Alpha,&#34; he said. He finished wrapping my leg and turned me to where my legs were on the island and my back was facing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait the future Alpha as in TERRY?&#34; I said with my wolf starting to come through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; He said confused. Of course, he forgot my mate who rejected me is the future Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YOU WILL NOT GIVE HIM PERMISSION TO ENTER THIS LAND,&#34; My wolf said fury blinding her. I was pushed back and she fought for control. My vision went black then red. She wanted revenge. She wanted his blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you bring Sophia back please so I can fix whatever is wrong?&#34; He kindly asked my wolf. She wanted full control over me but I fought back with one last push and my vision went back to normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you so against the future Alpha?&#34; He asked slowly so he won&#39;t piss my wolf off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you this when I first met you,&#34; I said rolling my eyes and throwing my hands in the air. He&#39;s my second chance mate he should at least know who rejected me so he could have a chance with me. He looked like he was having an internal argument with his wolf. His face turned from confused to pale then red with anger. He let out a large growl that shook the chandelier. He let out a long string of curses and walked next to the fridge. He lifts his fists and punches a large hole in the wall next to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Titus!&#34; I said disapprovingly. I got off the island and walked over to him. I grabbed his arm which had blood rolling down it. I sigh and bring him to the island.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit,&#34; I said pointing at the island. He grabbed me by my waist and lifted me. I let out a squeak and ended up in the same position with my back facing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m taking care of you, not the other way around,&#34; he grumbles picking up the antibacterial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So do you now remember why I don&#39;t like the future Alpha?&#34; I ask as he starts to lift my shirt but I stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait let me go put shorts on you pervert,&#34; I said and hopped off the counter. I ran into my room and my closet. I take a fresh pair of shorts off the shelf and put it on I pull my shirt up so I can see my back. It was mostly healed so I don&#39;t know why Titus was fussing about it. There were a few scratches here and there but nothing too terrible. It was mostly healed but there was still a lot of blood stains. I sigh pull my shift back down and walk back outside. Titus was washing the blood of his hands and I sat back on the counter. I felt him lift my shirt and let out a disapproving growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I liked it when you had no shorts on,&#34; I heard his grumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what&#39;s the plan for tomorrow because knowing my old mate that he&#39;ll bring his slut. And lately, his wolf has been calling out for us,&#34; I say as he starts to clean the few scratches I have. He slams his fist into the marble table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The plan is you stay next to me at all times and if even looks at you or thinks about you I will end him,&#34; he growls pulling my shirt down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So I have to be stuck with you the whole day?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; He says closing the med kit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow is going to be a long day,&#34; I mumble.</p>
