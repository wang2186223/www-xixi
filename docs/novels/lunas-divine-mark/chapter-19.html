                <p>Sophia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted back into my wolf and ran far from him. I run the far way back to the house and shift back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brody toss me your shirt,&#34; I call out to him when I see him sitting there on his phone. He looks at me and nods. He pulls it over his head and tosses it to me. I mumble a thank you run off to a spare room and crumble down at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to use all my strength to not go back there and tear that she-wolf into pieces. Tears run down my face and I stuff my face into my knees. I&#39;ve been crying lately but it&#39;s not like my world is falling apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the door vibrate as someone knocked on it. The smell of Titus came through under the door and I let out a shaky breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go away Titus,&#34; I tried to say as I wasn&#39;t crying but it failed. I hit my head against the door in aggravation. I stood up and opened the door and stared at him with tears running down my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he whispers. I let out a hurt laugh and shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know how that made me feel? It felt like someone took my heart in their hand and crushed it right in front of me. It felt like someone had stabbed me in my stomach and you stood there and did nothing,&#34; I growl at him. I wipe the tears from my eyes and walk past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you want me to do I can&#39;t attack her in front of my pack,&#34; he yells from the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the fucking Alpha and you let everyone watch you betray your mate right in front of me. How the fuck do you think that makes me feel. You haven&#39;t introduced me to any of your pack and now some she-wolf thinks she&#39;s Luna? I&#39;m done with the bullshit,&#34; I mumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do you think I felt when you keep pushing me away? You pushed me away when we almost mated. You pushed me away last night and now you&#39;re pushing me away,&#34; he tells me.y eyes flashed with anger as I look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know why I ran from you? It&#39;s because I&#39;m terrified. I&#39;m terrified of losing you and I run when I&#39;m scared. I was scared of rejection so I ran from my pack. I froze up when I tried to save Tala in the rouges in the woods. My life is falling apart and I can&#39;t do anything about it but wait. You don&#39;t want me as a mate. I&#39;m too high maintenance. If there was a way to get your true mate back I would make sure you choose her instead of me. I&#39;m too broken for anyone to have me,&#34; I finally say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks at me with regret and guilt in his eyes. I felt my legs give out and my vision became blurred and I collapsed to the ground. I groan as I feel Titus&#39;s hands on my back and hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re bleeding out why the fuck aren&#39;t you healing?&#34; he asks me worried. I called out to my wolf but I couldn&#39;t sense her. The she-wolf must have made her distraught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wolf is gone,&#34; I mumble to him. He slams his fist into the wall next to me but I was too weak to react to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take me to the pack hospital,&#34; I mumble to him weakly. He shakes his head and sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re all in meetings today,&#34; he tells me. &#34;Where the fuck is your wolf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the fuck is my wolf?&#34; I ask him. &#34;Maybe it was caused by my mate kissing some other she-wolf I point out.&#34; He sighs and picks me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brody?&#34; I weakly called out to him. He walks from the kitchen and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take Tala and distract her for a while I don&#39;t need her to see me right now,&#34; I tell him weekly. Brody takes Tala out of the room while Titus shields me with his body. Once she was out, he walked me into my room and laid me on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your injuries right now are fatal to humans and without your wolf, you&#39;re a human,&#34; he tells me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for pointing that out Sherlock,&#34; I said rolling my eyes. He walks into my bathroom grabs the med pack out of my bathroom and sits me up. He takes the gauze out lifts my shirt and starts to wrap it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit Sophia I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; he apologizes. I sigh and look away. I watch the leaves slowly fall down the trees leaving them empty. The forest ground around the house was brown. I don&#39;t know why they see leaves as different colors. They just end up dead anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When does Dr. Jones get back?&#34; I ask him. He blanks out for a few seconds then looks back at me with sorrow in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three hours,&#34; he tells me. I let out a groan and started to turn onto my side but Titus held me on my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fidget or move. You&#39;ll be in more pain if you start moving around,&#34; he says moving his thumb back and forth caressing my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a whimper as pain shot up through my spine and throughout my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh, I know baby. I requested a pack doctor from the nearest pack they&#39;re on the way right now. You&#39;ll be alright,&#34; he whispers trying to soothe me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t there nurses today?&#34; I groan slightly with each word. The pain was becoming unbearable. If my wolf was here I could handle it but she isn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are two and they are both missing I have my pack members looking for them as we speak,&#34; he tells me kissing my forehead. I felt my wolf slightly as his lips on our body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kiss me again,&#34; I say quickly determined to get my wolf back. He looks at me confused but his eyes filled with lust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hardly think it&#39;s the time for that right now considering the pain you&#39;re in,&#34; he says but his body says otherwise. He carefully leaned his head to my neck and left a trail of small kisses until he got to my lip. I felt the power of my wolf start to seep back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain in my back started to disappear. I gained the energy pack to wrap my arms around his neck and pull him closer to me. The scent of another female on Titus made my wolf want to put ours on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I push away as a sharp pain shoots through my spine again at such a sudden movement. Titus growls in disapproval then back away looking into my eyes. &#34;They&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard two soft knocks on the door and two doctors came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for coming Dr. Woods and Lewis,&#34; he greets them. Both male doctors lifted me off of my back and onto my chest. I let out a yelp as my face hit the pillow. Titus lets out a growl at how they are handling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lifted my shirt to my chest and started to unwrap the bandages Titus put on. I felt Titus&#39; gaze on my back like I had some sort of infection. My back tingled everywhere he laid his eyes on me. I felt something wet on my back as they cleaned my wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf whimpered in my head wanting Titus&#39; lips back on our body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You went missing for an hour when he was here you can&#39;t be grumbling in my head,&#39; I tell her frustrated. I see her roll her eyes and I growl at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I took all the damn pain while you were off sulking somewhere so be quiet,&#39; I snap at her. She lowers her head and lays down quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay you should be healed in 30 minutes since your wolf is back,&#34; Dr. Lewis tells me. I flip back over feeling a little pain and thank both doctors. Titus shows them out of the house and walks back into my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever told you these walls are soundproof,&#34; he says slowly closing the doors and locking them. His eyes were glazed with lust as he looked at me. He crawls onto the bed and puts his hand on the backboard steadying himself and his other across my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leans down and kisses me. &#34;Titus,&#34; I warned. He smiles and kisses me again. His hand wandered under my back and my shirt. His hand wanders under my bra and massages my back. He deepens the kiss as I feel his waist push into mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands wander through his hair and onto his back pulling myself to him. I felt my need for him grow as the bond between us tightened. I felt something hard push through his pants and onto my leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Titus,&#34; I groan as he thrust his hips on me. I flip him under me and straddle him no longer having control over my body. He leaves a trail of small kisses down my neck as I grind my hips on his. I moan as he starts to suck on the spot where my mark was supposed to be. My hands go under his shirt lifting it over his head. My hands run over his abs as he continues to kiss me. He pulled my shirt over my head and started to work on my bra.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made a sound to tell him to stop. &#34;It&#39;s moving too quickly,&#34; I whisper on his lips. He nods, respecting my decision but still, his hands find their way underneath my bra. His hand massages my breast as I deepen the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mark me,&#34; I moan to Titus as his bulge thrusts into my hips. He stopped kissing me and pushed his head back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure? I thought you weren&#39;t ready,&#34; he says out of breath. I breathe heavily trying to catch my breath as I put my head on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let me change my decision,&#34; I say kissing his jawline and then his lips. He flips us over and straddles me hunching over and kissing my neck. I let out a shaky breath as I tried to prepare myself for him to mark me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt his canines sharpen against my skin as I showed my neck for him to mark me. I feel his teeth sink into my neck and I let out a cry of pain but eventually, it became a pleasure. I moan in delight as pleasure overtook my body. I felt another presence force itself into my head. I felt the bond seal in between us. He takes his canines out of my neck and licks the blood off my neck cleaning it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my vision blur and the last thing I saw or felt was Titus&#39; lips on mine.</p>
