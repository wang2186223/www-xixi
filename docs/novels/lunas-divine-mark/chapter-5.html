                <p>Sophia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wake up in another cold sweat and tears down my face. The only difference from last time is that Titus didn&#39;t come and comfort me. I sit up and try to calm myself down. I try to do those breathing exercises my family always tries to get me to do. My breathing began to become shorter and choppier. The back of my throat became dry so I got up still trying to calm myself down. I walk outside, my vision still blurry from just waking up so suddenly, and pour myself a cup of water. I gulp it down and it helps my breathing a bit. I walk to the front door and see a guard. &#34;Can you ask Beta Brody to come here?&#34; I ask through hiccups. He nods silently. He looks like he blanked into space which let me know he was using mind-link. Minutes later the doors open and Brody walks in. He looks like he just woke up. &#34;Are you okay Soph,&#34; He says looking at me. &#34;N-no,&#34; I hiccup. I wrap my arms around his body but he doesn&#39;t do it back. &#34;Soph Titus won&#39;t be happy if my scent is on you,&#34; he says cautiously. &#34;Well, he isn&#39;t here to calm me down,&#34; I snap back immediately regretting it. &#34;I&#39;m sorry if I woke you,&#34; I whisper. &#34;It&#39;s okay,&#34; he says wrapping his hands around me. I try to back away knowing Titus will be happy. &#34;Titus won&#39;t be happy,&#34; I mumble. &#34;I stay here till you fall asleep,&#34; he says. We walk back to my room in silence. My breathing was turning back to normal. I wiped the stray tears on my cheek away and climbed into my bed. &#34;Thank you,&#34; I whisper to Brody. He sat on the armchair in the corner and smiled. I started to drift into sleep but it was interrupted by a loud crash. My door flung open almost flying off the hinges. &#34;Why is your scent on my mate,&#34; His voice booms through my room. &#34;You idiot! You hear her crying uncontrollably and do nothing so obviously I&#39;m going to do something. She was just about to fall asleep but you dumbass couldn&#39;t wait could you. You claim she&#39;s your mate but this is probably the first time she&#39;s seen your face today. You ignore her and all she is probably so confused but you give no explanation,&#34; Brody says mad. Titus&#39; eyes became black letting us know his wolf was out. &#34;Stay away from my mate,&#34; His low voice says. &#34;No. She needs help and obviously, you aren&#39;t giving it to her. She has panic attacks at night and you can&#39;t even help her. As her mate, you need to comfort her but you&#39;re afraid,&#34; he says. Titus&#39; gaze makes it to my eyes and his features soften but go back when he looks back at Brody. &#34;You&#39;re not her mate so why are you here?&#34; He says his low voice getting louder. Brody doesn&#39;t look afraid. I don&#39;t know why he was protecting me I&#39;ve known him for two days. &#34;You should be thanking me. You would have to deal with her crying all night and sit in your room not doing anything.&#34; Am I a burden to them? Maybe I should leave I&#39;m already causing problems. &#34;If you&#39;re not going to protect her...I will,&#34; Brody says. It set Titus&#39; wolf off he clenched his fists and swung. &#34;STOP,&#34; I screamed. Titus&#39; fist stopped a few centimeters in front of Brody&#39;s face. Titus&#39; eyes went back to his sky-blue eyes. He looked at me and just realized what he was about to do in front of me. He abruptly left and slammed the door closed. Brody looks at me with sorry in his eyes. &#34;I&#39;m sorry for that,&#34; he apologizes. &#34;It&#39;s okay you were just sticking up for me. Why?&#34; I ask. &#34;You&#39;re like a sister to me now. I&#39;ve known you for. What? Two days? But I feel like I&#39;ve known you for months.&#34; I give a light smile to him. &#34;Whoever your mate is, they&#39;re going to be lucky,&#34; I tell him. He smiles and nods. I lay back down and snuggled into my blanket. &#34;Goodnight,&#34; He whispers. &#34;Goodnight,&#34; I whisper back. And finally sleep took me. --- Flashback Day 9 &#34;I wish I could make you mine,&#34; the man whispered in my ear. He poked my birthmark with a silver knife. I flinch waiting for the burn. When we&#39;re young, parents teach us to stay away from silver because it&#39;s dangerous to our kind. The tip of the blade broke my skin but it didn&#39;t burn like it was supposed to. It felt like a needle-breaking skin. &#34;SHE DIDN&#39;T EVEN FLINCH,&#34; He said throwing the knife at the wall. &#34;Sir she&#39;s immune we already know that,&#34; an unknown voice said. I&#39;ve heard him before but I&#39;ve never seen him. &#34;GET THE MARK OF OFF HER,&#34; the man in front of me yelled at him. He punched the wall which caused him to put a hole in the wall. He let out a deep growl and stormed out of the cell they kept me in. The mystery man came out of the shadow and picked the silver knife off the ground. He came up to me and dug the knife into my shoulder. I let out a blood-curdling scream as he dug out a chunk of my skin. Blood rolled down my shoulder. &#34;We&#39;ll see if it&#39;s gone by the time it heals,&#34; he mumbles. He uncuffs me from the wall and walked out. He looks at the cell and walks out. I wipe the blood off my shoulder. It soaks into my torn-up shirt. --- I woke up to someone tapping my shoulder. I gasp and sit up quickly. I look around my room and see Charlotte standing at the side of my bed. &#34;I&#39;m sorry if I startled you, Sophia,&#34; she apologizes. &#34;It&#39;s okay,&#34; I said steadying my breathing. She walks over and opens the curtains. I saw that it blocked a door that led to a balcony that I hadn&#39;t noticed before. &#34;Would you like breakfast?&#34; She asked. I threw the blanket off of me and shook my head &#39;No&#39;. &#34;Can I just have a cup of orange juice?&#34; I ask. &#34;Of course. I&#39;ll get that right away,&#34; she says and leaves. I stand up and stretch. I walked into the bathroom and brushed my teeth. I walked into the closet and it was filled. There was a note on the mirror hanging from the door. Enjoy your new clothes -Titius I ripped it off the mirror and threw it into the trash. I was pretty pissed at what happened last night. My wolf disappeared somewhere in the back of my mind she was also upset. I walked around and looked at all the clothes that were on the shelves and drawers. From formal wear to comfortable clothes, there was everything. Read me to pay them back. I made a mental note. I grab a pair of sweatpants off the 2nd shelf and a loose shirt. I pull my hair into a messy bun and make my way to the kitchen. I take a seat on the barstool and see a glass of orange juice waiting. &#34;Thanks, Charlotte,&#34; I smile at her. &#34;You&#39;re welcome. If you don&#39;t mind Sophia I need to get to my duties at the pack house. Gamma Jacob should be here soon to watch you,&#34; she says cleaning up the rest of the dishes. &#34;Go ahead I&#39;ll be fine,&#34; I say getting up from my seat. I hear the front door shut closed and I head to the Library. I scan the book titles one by one. There were so many books I didn&#39;t know how to choose. I see a book that interests me. Mythology: Wolves. &#34;I&#39;ve read that twice,&#34; I hear a voice say behind me. I let out a shriek and jumped backward. &#34;Woah careful there,&#34; the voice says grabbing onto my shoulders. I focus my gaze on a blonde in front of me. The Gamma. &#34;I&#39;m sorry Luna I didn&#39;t mean to startle you,&#34; the Gamma apologizes. &#34;It&#39;s okay and call me Sophia, please. I&#39;m not used to the title yet,&#34; I nervously chuckle. &#34;Alright, Sophia. My name is Jacob by the way,&#34; he introduces himself. We sit down on the library seats and start talking. &#34;So what&#39;s your story,&#34; he asks. I take a sip of my orange juice. &#34;My story?&#34; I was confused &#34;Yeah like what happened in your life. You smell like a rouge,&#34; he says sniffing the air. I explain everything from Terry to now. It was hard to keep my emotions but I did it. &#34;Wow you&#39;ve been through quite a lot Sophia,&#34; he says. &#34;Yeah a lot,&#34; I mumble. It&#39;s been a hell of a week.</p>
