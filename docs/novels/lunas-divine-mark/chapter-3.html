                <p>&#34;After you sign this paperwork,&#34; she says handing him a clipboard and a pen. He scans through the papers and doesn&#39;t write anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your name, Angel?&#34; He asks. I realize that I only know his name because he&#39;s the strongest Alpha but he doesn&#39;t know mine. My wolf jumped in my head when he called us Angel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia Moretti,&#34; I say. He writes a few things down on the pages. Then asks about my age and then my birth parents&#39; names. He hands Dr. Jones back the clipboard then lets us leave.</p>

                <p>&#34;I&#39;m staying with you?&#34; I ask in surprise. &#34;I can stay in the pack house, I don&#39;t mind.&#34; He growls when I say that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mine,&#34; he growls.</p>

                <p>&#34;No you&#39;re mine you stay with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can stay with you too,&#34; I say as we continue walking toward his house. His eyes flash back to his blue eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So do you have any siblings?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, a brother. He&#39;s two years younger than me. You?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a sister named Laura and a brother named James. James is 21 and Laura is 5,&#34; I explain. The age difference is a common thing around wolves so, the 13-year age difference isn&#39;t a big deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does your brother have a mate?&#34; He asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, we suspect she&#39;s in a different pack,&#34; I say. I felt comfortable talking with him. I usually don&#39;t around people I don&#39;t know. As we passed the pack house, there was a house a little bit smaller than the pack house but looked more expensive. I scanned the house looking for one thing, a garden. In the front, there were flower beds surrounding the side of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a garden!&#34; I smile looking at him. He laughs and nods. I feel the blood rushing to my face in embarrassment and I look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mom used to care for the flowers then she got into cooking. You can use the garden for whatever you like,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; I said getting excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah feel free to do anything.&#34; I smile and think of all the things I could do. Alpha Titus opened the door and the interior was beautiful. I gasp in shock. I looked up and the carvings on the ceiling were intricate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had this house made a few years ago,&#34; He says continuing to walk up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Titus it&#39;s beautiful,&#34; I compliment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growls, &#34;Don&#39;t call me Alpha just Titus. We are equals as mates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S-Sorry Alp- Titus,&#34; I correct myself. He took a deep breath and calmed himself down. He walked down a hallway and into a room. When we walked in, Titus&#39; scent was clear in this room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;This is his room,&#39; I tell my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my room. You can stay in here or in a guest room,&#34; he says. I look around the room and my eyes land on a picture. I walk to the table it was on and look at it. There was a beautiful redhead girl with perfect blue eyes. I heard Titus say something but I wasn&#39;t listening. My only thought was that she was his girlfriend or wife. My wolf whimpers at the thought of our mate having a relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s my first mate, Brooke,&#34; He says breaking me from my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I met her a few years ago. She was human. I met her the day she died.&#34; Apart from me felt happy that he wasn&#39;t with anyone else but also sad that he had to go through that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was in a car crash with her boyfriend. I was in the streets coming back from a rogue in the border and there was a large crash. My wolf pushed me to go check it out and I saw my mate bloody and cut up from the impact. There was a strong smell of alcohol. I became depressed for a few months then Brody, my beta, pulled me out of it. He would do things to distract me like sparring with me to get my anger out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I whisper feeling bad that he had to tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay,&#34; he says putting his hand on my cheek. I look up at him and smile. I felt safe with him. I didn&#39;t want to go back to my pack. I want to stay here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I stay in a guest room for now?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you want angel,&#34; he smiles. No one calls me pet names except Dad but the only thing he calls me is sweetheart. He leads me to a room right across from his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My room is right across from yours if you need anything,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have any clothes,&#34; I whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can get one of my omegas to buy you some I just need you to write your sizes down,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll do it later. What time is it?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;9:47 PM are you hungry?&#34; He asks me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kind off,&#34; I say fiddling with my fingers. He nods his head and leads me to the kitchen. He opened the fridge and it was packed with all sorts of things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want pasta?&#34; He asks looking in the fridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; I say sitting down on the barstool on the island. He started making pasta and talking to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want to ask me?&#34; he asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are the stories true?&#34; I ask immediately. The stories of Alpha Titus torturing his pack and any trespassers. He overworked his warriors and elite wolves. The Scarlet Pack torture chambers. These stories are told to us when we are small to teach us not to run away and get caught by them. Look where I am now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Most of them. About the torture chambers meant for traitors and rogues. But, I don&#39;t starve and torture my pack. I&#39;d risk my life for them. I care for my pack but other packs can&#39;t know that. They would take advantage of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you get that scar?&#34; I ask pointing at his arm. There was a large line down his left arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got this when the Yellow Crescent pack attached when my dad was Alpha,&#34; he says continuing to make the pasta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When you were 16?&#34; I gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he says lowly. The story of his dad was known throughout the world. He was one of the greatest Alphas to ever live. He died protecting Luna Kate, Titus&#39; mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Kade used a silver knife and dragged it down my arm,&#34; he explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He used silver against his own wolves?&#34; I say shocked. The details of the pack war were private to other packs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I killed him though for what he did to my Dad,&#34; he says pouring the sauce and pasta in two plates. He grabbed forks and cheese and sat down next to me. I grabbed a handful of cheese poured it on my pasta and took a bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is so good,&#34; I moan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad you like it,&#34; he laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have anything to sleep in,&#34; I say. I had been wearing an omegas clothes for the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here,&#34; Titus says taking off his shirt and tossing it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I smell like him,&#39; my wolf says. I slip it on and it stopped at my knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be across the hall if you need anything,&#34; he says. &#34;Goodnight,&#34; he whispers and leaves. I got in bed and off the lights and immediately fell asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashback</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Day 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in silver handcuffs hung up on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why isn&#39;t the silver or wolfsbane not working on her,&#34; someone growls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at her birthmark it&#39;s protecting her,&#34; another mystery voice says. I had a birthmark on my shoulder in the shape of a crescent moon. I thought it was because I am in the Blue Crescent Wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to get rid of it,&#34; I heard the first voice growl. Then there was a loud bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>End of Flashback</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up to a piercing scream. Then I realized it was mine. My breathing was heavy and there was sweat down my face. The door flung open and Titus came running to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay are you hurt?&#34; He says looking me up and down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had a nightmare,&#34; I said tears streaming down my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh it&#39;s okay,&#34; he says putting my head in the crook of his neck. He puts one hand on my head and one on my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay just breathe,&#34; he says. I take a deep breath. Titus&#39; scent calms my wolf and me down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m okay,&#34; I choke out between cries trying to pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t,&#34; he says to get me to stop moving. He holds me until I control my tears. His hold was comforting enough to make me fall asleep again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Titus Stone&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard Sophia&#39;s heartbeat even out letting me know she was asleep. My wolf loves the fact that our mate fell asleep in our arms. I slowly picked her up bridal style and brought her over to my room. I gently laid her on the bed. I turn off the lamp and lay next to her. She starts to stir but I put my arm around her waist. She started to return to her sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight Angel,&#34; I whisper. The Moon Goddess blessed us both with second chance mates. I couldn&#39;t ask for a better one. I kiss her temple and fall asleep.</p>
