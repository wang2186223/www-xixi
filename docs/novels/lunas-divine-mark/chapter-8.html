                <p>Sophia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bright light peeked through the curtains waking me up. I groan and try to turn the other way but I couldn&#39;t move. I looked down and saw Titus&#39; arms wrapped securely around my waist. I accepted defeat and just shielded my eyes by hiding my face in his chest. He shifted a little but then relaxed. His scent was intoxicating to my nose but it relaxed me. I started to fall asleep again but then Titus sighed and tensed up again. He was awake now. Then, I realized that my bladder was full.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Titus,&#34; I whisper as I poke his face. He groans and turns his body bringing me with him. I let out a squeal and landed on top of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not helping my bladder,&#34; I groan. He lets me go with a smile on his face. I mumbled thanks and quickly went to the bathroom. I walk back out and sink into the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have Alpha work today?&#34; I ask him when I get comfortable in the blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unfortunately,&#34; he says setting his phone down. I let out a groan and lay face down on my pillow and put my arm under it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll send Brody over to watch you,&#34; he said. I felt the bed rise as he got off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Charlotte? Will she be coming today?&#34; I ask. I take my face off the pillow and look at where Titus is standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has a job at the pack house today watching the pups at daycare,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t Brody have his Beta duties today too?&#34; I ask sitting back up on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, but I still need someone to watch you.&#34; He walks into my closet for a few minutes and comes out in a suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, how did you get that out of my closet?&#34; I asked very confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I put some of my clothes in here just in case,&#34; he explained. &#34;I have to leave now but I&#39;ll promise I&#39;ll be back early tonight,&#34; he says. He kissed my cheek and left. I felt my wolf try to push her way out. She was restless from not being able to have a release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I know you wanna shift but you have to wait a little bit more. We are still considered a rouge and if someone sees us they&#39;ll attack,&#39; I said trying to convince her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;We can take them we&#39;re strong enough,&#39; she answers back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Yes but we can&#39;t attack Titus&#39; pack,&#34; I said matter of factly. As much as I would like her to go on a run, we can&#39;t risk being found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soph I&#39;m coming and you better not fucking scare me,&#34; I heard Brody yell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in my room but get ready I can always do a sneak attack,&#34; I yell back to him. I walk into my closet and lock the door. I scanned my wardrobe and decided on a blue crop top and a pair of white jeans. I put on my fuzzy socks and then heard the bedroom door open. I walk out and see Brody looking in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I was thinking we were gonna go to the woods but you dressed so nicely today. I would hate to ruin it,&#34; he says sarcastically. My wolf curses at me for choosing cute clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groan, &#34;Now I have to change &#39;cause my wolf is trying to claw her way out of me.&#34; I walked back into my closet and grabbed clothes I wouldn&#39;t mind ripping. I walk back out to find Brody sitting on the bed reading the Harry Potter book that was on my nightstand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait...am I allowed outside because I don&#39;t think Titus will be happy you brought me back out considering what happened yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you&#39;re gonna be in the protection of me and we&#39;re going on the restricted path so no one will find you,&#34; he says putting the book down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay number one I&#39;m pretty sure I beat your ass yesterday so I&#39;ll be protecting you and, doesn&#39;t restricted mean not allowed of something. So why are we going there?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the higher ranks only. Titus kept a piece of land for us to train on without being interrupted by pack members. It helps us keep our mind focused on training,&#34; he explains. I gave an &#39;oh&#39; expression. I couldn&#39;t focus because my wolf was jumping around in excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we leave now because my wolf won&#39;t stop pestering me about letting her loose,&#34; I ask. He nodded and I silently thanked the moon god. I got on the porch and let the sun sink into my skin. I leaped off the steps and shifted mid-air letting my wolf out. A large toothy wolf plastered her face. Brody followed and shifted into his wolf. It was a beautiful brown wolf that looked almost red if he stood in the sun. His wolf pointed his head into the forest and started to run. My wolf loud out a loud howl and followed him. We kept a steady pace with him almost running ahead of him. She wanted to run faster and enjoy the wind flowing through her fur but I pulled her back so that we could see where Brody was leading us. It was a difficult path filled with the roots of the y&#39;all trees overhead. The rocks scattered the forest and the leaves were like another layer on top of the forest ground. In the distance, I saw a white sign that wasn&#39;t easy to miss. As we passed it I scanned it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Restricted areas do not pass. Orders by Alpha Titus&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of Titus filled my senses with a mix of Brody and Jacob. He must use this area the most. As we ran through the forest I noticed the grooves in the trees. Claw marks scattered the trees along the path. There was also a tree with a large hole going through it. I caught a scent of blood passing it. It was old maybe a few weeks? As we got further into the forest, he started to slow down. The trees started to thin out and they eventually led to a large clearing. Before we could reach Brody stopped and went behind a tree. I heard bones crack and he came back out wearing shorts. He tossed me a shirt and boxers that smelled like Titus. It landed on my face and my wolf gave him a long glare He chuckled and mumbled a &#39;sorry.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go change behind the trees over there,&#34; he pointed. My wolf was reluctant but I promised I&#39;d take her hunting and she finally gave in. I shifted back and quickly threw the clothes on and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is the middle of the forest,&#34; he said leading me towards the opening of the forest. A beautiful lake came into view. It sparked in the sun and it was so clear I could see the bottom of the lake. It stretched at least a mile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you swim Soph?&#34; He asked. I nodded and suddenly I wasn&#39;t on the ground but soaking wet. I was completely submerged underwater. I swim up and let out a gasp for air. I wipe the water from my face and push the hair out of my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brody what was that for!&#34; I yell at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soph this is the beginning of your training,&#34; he gives a smug smile. He walks over to a boat I swear I didn&#39;t see just now. But it could also be how I was thrown into this lake. He pulled a rope out of it and tied it to the front of the boat and tossed the other end to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want me to do with this?&#34; I ask holding it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pull me across this lake then maybe you&#39;ll pull me back. Depends on how fast you go,&#34; he says. He sits down and takes his phone out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And go.&#34; I groan and start pulling him across the lake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re heavy,&#34; I mumble under my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can still hear you,&#34; he shouts back. After about half an hour, I started to get tired. I continue to pull him then slip on a sharp rock. I let out a string of curses and saw red pool into the clear water. I look behind me at the boat and see Brody sleeping. I looked and saw that the other side was only about 1/4 mile left. I let go of the rope and left him stranded. I swim the rest of the way and lay on the ground. I looked behind a large boulder and found fresh, dry clothes. After I changed, I yelled as loud as I could and Brody jumped up almost tipping the boat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re stuck there. Have fun,&#34; I laugh. I sit down on a nice flat boulder and watch Brody try to figure out how to get across.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate you, Soph,&#34; He yells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what you get for falling asleep,&#34; I yell back.</p>
