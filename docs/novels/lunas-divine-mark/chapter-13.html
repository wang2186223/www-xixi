                <p>Sophia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let the steaming water fill the bathtub. I don&#39;t mind the hot water. It was soothing against my bruised and cut-up body. I climb into the bath letting the blood on my body seep into the water. The water became a shade of pink mixed in with dirt that sank to the bottom. I let out a groan in annoyance. I&#39;ll have to change the water again now that it&#39;s dirty. I climb out wrap a towel around my body and drain the water. I rinsed the dirt down the drain and I started to fill the water up again. I walk into my bedroom and look out the window. My eyes scan the edge of the woods and I sense someone or something out there. Amid the trees, I see a wolf with red eyes looking at something at the bottom of the tree. I see something tiny start to move and a child, no older than 4, trembling at the bottom of the tree. I quickly threw my towel off and flung the door open to the balcony. I jump over the edge and let my wolf take full control. She broke through the prison of skin and swiftly made her way through the trees and to the child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wolf with the red feral eyes saw the movement through the trees and made eye contact with my silver, glowing eyes. He growled sensing a threat. His canines showed through his snarl as he kept his eyes on mine. My wolf was focused ready to take him on but then she stopped and those red eyes came flooding into her memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashback</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fall limp on the ground letting my arms rest after being held up for hours. My right shoulder stung from the constant torture of it. I heard a low huff of a wolf nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look up Sophia,&#34; I heard someone command me. My pride was in the way of listening to the order. My wolf felt the power of this man and pushed me to listen. I lifted my head with the rest of the strength I had left and saw a wolf, with terrifying red eyes, blocking my view of the man that commanded me. He lowered his nose to my neck and his breathing sent shivers down my spine. This wolf was dangerous and I wanted to scream, to run away from him, to plead for help, but I had no more energy. I stayed limp letting the voice in my head tell me off. He heard a loud snarl and teeth sank into my shoulder. I let out a piercing scream as I saw him drop a piece of my skin that was once on my shoulder in front of me. Blood rolled down my arm making a pool around my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a whimper and opened my mouth to scream for help but nothing came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>End of Flashback</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those eyes stared into mine with a smirk across his wolf face. My wolf let out a snarl and showed him my teeth. His skin started to show and his fur became skin. He stood tall and had a smirk plastered on his face. His face was so ingrained in my brain and I wanted to run but my instincts took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Save the child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia Moretti, I told you I would find you,&#34; he said. The blood drained from my face but my wolf was determined to kill him. She wanted his blood draining down the bathtub. She wanted his blood to be washed off our bodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed his scent was covered. I couldn&#39;t smell him which infuriated me. How did he get past border control? I saw the child at the tree stump shivering and I knew that I just needed to get her out of here. I heard a loud growl from behind me and I turned my head towards the noise. I see Brody&#39;s red wolf behind me focused on the man with the red eyes. His eyes were glazed over. He wasn&#39;t in control of his wolf anymore. A threat to his Luna must have clicked a trigger. The man still had a smirk on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifts into his wolf and pounces at Brody. I jumped and tackled him mid-air before he could make contact with Brody. We rolled down the hill and he landed on top of me. I struggle and try to get out of his hold. Brody came down the hill and aimed for his neck but he was quicker. He moved with incredible speed and dodged him. He was too fast for a normal wolf. I turn to go help Brody but I see a man blocking my view. I felt something stab into my neck. He pulls the syringe out and smirks. My vision became blurry and it became hard to stand up. Before I collapse I let out a long howl calling for help.</p>

                <p>The last drop of the beer rolls down the bottle and into my mouth. I throw the bottle with the rest and reach for another bottle but I freeze. I a howl of desperation as let out from the woods further down near my house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Titus Sophie needs help now,&#39; Brody says frantically. Where the hell did they go?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Where are you,&#39; I ask through the mind link running out of my office. I shift into my wolf outside and run to the place the howl came from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;We&#39;re near the old lake house,&#39; he says back. Before he could close it again he let out a grunt. My wolf fought with me wanting to take control. He needed to get to his mate and save her. I pushed him back and took control. I ran towards the old lake house my dad made for my mom. I see Brody fighting two wolves and beating him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at the bottom of the hill and see my naked mate at the bottom unconscious. It sent my wolf over the edge. He let out the loudest growl I&#39;ve ever heard him do and took control of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard voices but all I could see was black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it Jones why the fuck isn&#39;t she waking up,&#34; I heard someone growl. I assumed it was Titus because I could feel the power seeping into the air of the room. Or I assumed it was a room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha she was injected with human sedatives. Her skin side will be out for a few hours,&#34; the lady said. I assumed it was Doctor Jones. I started to see a bright light and I could move my fingers. My eyes slowly opened and I saw the walls of the pack hospital. I couldn&#39;t recall anything that happened since Brody and I&#39;s training. I let out a groan as I try to move my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna please don&#39;t move. Your body has several injuries,&#34; I heard the same lady say. Titus was immediately by my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened,&#34; I ask him softly. I didn&#39;t have any energy and I felt drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There were rouges in the forest and you got injected by human sedatives,&#34; he explains. I jolt up as the memories flow back into my brain. I remember the child and the rouge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you save the child,&#34; I ask frantically. He looked at me confused. &#34;There was a child at the edge of the forest.&#34; He shook his head and I panicked. I ripped</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the several wires out of my arms and ran through the hallways of the pack hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia stop,&#34; I growled chasing after me. I ignored his order and kept running. I shifted into my wolf as I burst through the doors. I took control not trusting my wolf and what she would do. She wanted to submit to Titus&#39; orders and run back to him but I fought with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran through the pack house yard and to Titus&#39; house. I arrive back at the woods behind the house and listen for her. I sniff around and see her lying by a tree. I shift back to skin and pick up her body. I felt for a pulse and it was there but barely. I needed to get her to the packed hospital fast. I see Titus&#39; wolf approach me with a look of disapproval on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Titus I know you&#39;re angry with me right now hit I need you to get her to the pack hospital now,&#34; I order. He looked at me suspiciously at first but I put her securely on his back and pointed in the direction of the pack hospital. He wanted me to go with him but he took the child knowing she was worse than me. I didn&#39;t rush myself to run safely with her on my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shift back to my wolf and run behind Titus making sure he brought her to the hospital. She was immediately brought to the attention of doctors. I walk into the hospital and shift back to skin. I was blinded by a cloth thrown on my face. I took the shirt off my face and threw it on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be careful not to run off while you&#39;re injured. Titus is very protective over you now,&#34; Jacob says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The child was more important than me at that moment,&#34; I tell him walking away. I followed the scent of Titus to a room. The little girl lay there with wires in her arms. How did she feet here? She was definitely a rouge but yet Titus took mercy on her. Her tiny eyes fluttered open and they were filled with panic. She looked around the room trying to figure out where she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, hey it&#39;s okay You safe now,&#34; I cooed trying to calm her down. She seemed to calm down a bit but not enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34; I ask her as I pull up a seat next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tala,&#34; she whispers to me. I nod and give her a smile. I wanted her to know that she was safe here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was the last thing you remember?&#34; I ask her trying to figure out what happened to her parents or guardian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mommy told me to run from the bad guys. To run as far as I could. A-and to hide f-from t-them,&#34; She begins to stutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Tala. You&#39;re gonna stay with me for a few weeks. Your mommy told me to come take care of you and keep you safe from the bad guys,&#34; I tell her. She nodded and seemed to calm down some more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t ask permission to add an additional member to this pack,&#34; I heard a familiar voice say. I turn and face Titus and let out a low growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need to ask you,&#34; I tell him and flick my head back to Tala.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dang Titus I don&#39;t envy you. Your mate is sassy,&#34; I heard Brody mumble. I turn my head to him with a fake smile on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to be my sparring partner next,&#34; I ask him. His eyes widened and he shook his head and I gave him a smirk. I turned my attention to Tala who was watching us quarrel. She had a small smile on my face that made my heart swell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How old are you?&#34; I ask her. She holds her hand up and sticks up 4 fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your 4?&#34; I confirm. She nods her head and smiles.</p>
