                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he whispers. I roll my eyes. He growls lightly at the disrespect I am showing him. I felt Titus&#39; hands on my shoulders leading me out of the situation. They got into their car and waved goodbye and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to watch my warriors train today and take notes on how they fight,&#34; he tells me. I look at him in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My training is more vigorous than warriors&#39; training,&#34; I tell him. He shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My warriors are trained by me. You are not. You need to learn my tactics of fighting,&#34; he tells me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what if I&#39;m attached? I&#39;m sure if they get through your warriors, they will know your fighting techniques. So, if I learn them I&#39;ll be at a disadvantage because they&#39;ll know what I know,&#34; I tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nice to know some more tactics,&#34; he says dismissing what I just said. I roll my eyes and sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your warriors use strength and force. They don&#39;t have speed. Fighting your way through everything won&#39;t help if you can&#39;t get out of that situation,&#34; I point out. He let out an agitated sigh and stayed silent. We walked up to the large training area and warriors were lined up in a row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Today I have my mate with me so she will be watching us today,&#34; he announces. I scanned the row of warriors and only recognized one. Nikolai. I gave him a small smile and he nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna,&#34; they all greet bowed in submission. I felt power emitting from them. I nod and they all lift their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, who would like to go first?&#34; Titus asks. One warrior stepped out of the line. He had mussels and dirty blonde hair that flopped over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, who&#39;s going to go against Christopher?&#34; Titus asks. I watched as someone started to come forward but I was quicker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; I announce. Everyone&#39;s eyes widen I think I even saw Titus&#39;s eyes widen slightly. I smirk and he nods. Chris walks into the fighting area and I follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to go easy on me just because I&#39;m the Luna,&#34; I tell him while tying my hair up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t planning to Luna,&#34; he smirks. He gets in position, bending his knees and leaning forward. I would be able to beat him in strength but definitely in speed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No shifting until I say so,&#34; Titus says. We both nod and I bend my knees and my elbows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;3. 2. 1. Go,&#34; he says counting down. I smile as he quickly charges at me. I watch his footing as he plants his foot into the ground and lands a punch on my stomach. I heard a protective growl come from Titus but I was already too focused on fighting back with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why aren&#39;t you fighting back Luna?&#34; He says circling me. I smirk and notice he starts to run up to me. He plants his left foot on the ground and swings his arm. I duck and grab it mid-air. I use my strength and flip him onto his back using my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lets out a series of coughs from getting the wind knocked out of him but he gets back on his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s speed it up it&#39;s getting boring to watch,&#34; I heard someone yell out. I turned to the source of the voice and it was someone I&#39;d never seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rule number 1. Don&#39;t take your eye off your opponent,&#34; I heard Caleb say. I smirk as everything around us is quiet. I focused my hearing waiting for him to steady himself before punching me. It never came so I assumed he was going to try to get me off my feet. I jumped as he tried to swipe me off my feet and socked him in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stumbles backward but catches himself. He swings his arm at my face and I duck and swipe him off his feet. He did a back roll until he was on his hands and feet. He got up and charged at me. He looks up his eyes glowing golden. He ran to me catching me off guard. He wraps his arms around me and slams me into the tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a groan as I saw his fist in front of my face. I move my head out of the way and his fists get lodged into the tree I was currently pinned on. The large splinters of wood cause his hand to be stuck in the tree. I take this chance and let my wolf come out. I felt my canines lengthen and so did my claws. I took my hand and stabbed my claws into his back and dragged my hand down it. He growls at me and tries to bite my arm but I send a blow to his stomach. He stumbles backwards which causes his arm to be free. He sends that fist straight to my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was too quick after he got loose. I stumbled onto my back and held my hand to my face. Blood came from my lip and stained my hand. He held his hands on me so I couldn&#39;t move. I thrashed under him trying to get free. He lifted his hand to try to get another punch at me but I grabbed his fist before he could hit my face. The impact on my shoulder caused me to groan softly. I pushed through the pain used my strength and crushed his fist. He retracted his fist quickly in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf begged to be let out and have full control to do whatever she could to take out her anger. I flashed my golden eyes at Titus begging him to be let loose. He gives me a nod and I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shift,&#34; he announces. I heard a few cheers from the small crowd as my wolf came forward. I let her take control as she was released from the cage of skin. She stood proudly eyeing the male in front of us. She let out a powerful roar and he quickly shifted to his gray wolf. I felt the power radiating from my wolf. The male jumped through the air making his fist move. My wolf jumped at him tackling him to the ground. He growled and sank his teeth into my shoulder. I whimpered in pain and bared my teeth at him. I felt his teeth reach bone and he let go. He got out of my hole from under me and snarled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She licked her mouth as she swiftly made her way zig-zagging her way around the male and sinking her teeth into his back. He arched his back in pain and sank to the ground. She planted her foot on his neck and growled at him to submit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growled in defiance but I snapped my teeth at him. He whimpered at the disapproval of his Luna and turned his head in submission. My wolf puffed up in pride and quickly ran to Titus. I pulled her back and I shifted back to skin. He took his shirt off and put it on me being careful not to hit any of my bruises. I saw the she-wolves drool at the sight of Titus shirtless. I saw one come up and grab his arm. It was the same girl I saw earlier. She looks at me and smirks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Titus baby can you fix my bra clasp, please? I think it came loose,&#34; she asks turning around and lifting her shirt. I rolled my eyes at this slut and leaned on my back foot. He fixed it and pulled her shirt back down. She turned around and smiled at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; she said pecking his lips and skipping off to her friends. I didn&#39;t wait to hear Titus apologize. I ran off into the woods in anger.</p>
