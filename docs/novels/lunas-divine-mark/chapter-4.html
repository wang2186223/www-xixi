                <p>Sophia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up in a familiar room but not the one I fell asleep in. The memories came flooding back from last night. I was in Titus&#39; room. I looked over my shoulder and no one was there. I felt the spot where the blanket wasn&#39;t covering. It was warm. Someone was just on there. My guess is Titus. The bathroom door swings open and he walks out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have pack work today I won&#39;t be back till later tonight. Stay in the house. The mind link me to Brody if you need anything. There are two guards in the front and two in the back,&#34; he says distantly. My wolf notices and lightly whines. Does he realize I&#39;m not in his pack? I can&#39;t mind the link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;We just met him yesterday, don&#39;t be quick to judge,&#39; I remind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will send a maid to help you with your needs,&#34; he says then walks out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh. I thought he would be nicer today. Maybe it&#39;s because of my outburst last night. Maybe he doesn&#39;t want me anymore like Terry didn&#39;t. My wolf let out a soft whine. I walk towards the kitchen and open the fridge. I take out the bottle of orange juice and pour a glass. I walk around the large alpha&#39;s house. I come across a room with double doors. I cautiously open the door and it opens up to a beautiful library. Some shelves lined the walls. It looked right out of the Beauty and the Beast library. There were sections for every genre. I walk around observing the books still sipping my orange juice. There were old and fairly new books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I wonder if he has Harry Potter?&#39; I ask my wolf. I didn&#39;t get a response from her. I think she was still sad about Terry and Titus. I sighed and realized that I was lonely now that my wolf was hiding somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna?&#34; I heard from behind me. I jump almost slipping my orange juice. I turn around and see an only lady standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Luna I, didn&#39;t mean to scare you,&#34; she apologizes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you the maid Titus sent for?&#34; I ask politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Luna,&#34; she nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t call me Luna. My name is Sophia,&#34; I smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Lu-Sophia,&#34; she quickly fixes herself. She looked around 50 but had a motherly feeling about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your name,&#34; I ask taking another sip of my drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Charlotte Montgomery, Lu-Sophia,&#34; she corrects herself again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Brody&#39;s mom?&#34; I asked surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes ma&#39;am,&#34; she says. It felt weird that a grownup was using formalities with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to be that formal with me you&#39;re older than me it feels weird.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods, &#34;Are you hungry?&#34; Leading me out of the kitchen. I notice some art hanging on the wall I didn&#39;t notice at first while walking down here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I&#39;m starving,&#34; I laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like pancakes?&#34; She asks looking in the pantry. I think if I want pancakes or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashback</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SOPHIA GET YO ASS DOWN HERE,&#34; I hear James&#39; voice from downstairs. I wince since my sensitive hearing was not helpful in this situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Young man Language,&#34; I hear my mom from downstairs. I snicker a little and start walking downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Soph,&#34; James says. I roll my eyes and walk into the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here take your pancake,&#34; he says as a piece of food comes flying towards my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;James!&#34; My mom and I shout at him. We all burst into laughter. My mom sighs, &#34;What am I going to do with y&#39;all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pick the pancake off the floor and hurl it back at James.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>End of Flashback</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia?&#34; I heard a voice snap me back from the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh? Oh yeah Pancakes are fine,&#34; I tell Charlotte. She gives a soft smile and starts making the batter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you put Nutella in the middle?&#34; I ask watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; she says taking the Nutella off the counter. She starts to pour the batter in the pan and puts some Nutella in the center than flips it. After doing it three more times, she puts them on the plate and put blueberries on top and hands them to me. She grabs the bottle of syrup and places it next to the plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Charlotte,&#34; I say pouring the syrup on top of my pancakes. I started to eat and noticed Charlotte wasn&#39;t eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to eat?&#34; I ask her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I eat at the pack house. It&#39;s still early for me,&#34; she explains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure? You can eat here,&#34; I offer. I felt bad eating in front of her. She made me food but she hasn&#39;t eaten any yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure Lu-Sophia,&#34; she smiles. I felt comfortable around her. She had the feeling my mom gave off. I heard the front door close from the other side of the house. Perks of werewolf hearing. I smelt a strong familiar scent come closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia?&#34; I hear. Brody&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in the kitchen,&#34; I reply to him. I hear his footsteps approach the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Mom,&#34; he greets Charlotte and hugs her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to check up on you,&#34; he says facing me. He said HE wanted to check up on me but a part of me felt like Titus sent him here. Brody is a Beta. He doesn&#39;t have time to just randomly check up on people. I know that there are reports of rogue attacks. My dad told me a few days ago about them. He talks about endless paperwork. The Scarlet Moon Pack probably has more paperwork than Blue Crescent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I call you Soph because Sophia is long and tiring to say,&#34; he laughs making an excuse to call me Soph. He had a big brother feeling towards him like James.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; I laugh rolling his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to steal Soph from you for a few,&#34; Brody says waving for me to follow him. I shove the last bite of my pancake in my mouth get up and follow him. We come to a room that looks like a lounge room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to play 20 questions?&#34; He asks. I looked at him with a dumbfounded look. He looked at me back with seriousness plastered on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brody&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;What are y&#39;all doing now?&#39; Titus asks in our mind link. Soph looks at me with pure confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I don&#39;t see why you can&#39;t just do this yourself she&#39;s your mate,&#39; I sigh back to him. &#39;She&#39;s confused.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you have a lot of paperwork?&#34; She asks. I actually do but Titus told me to find out information. Apparently he can&#39;t get close to her. A threat from the rogues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should watch out for your mate. The</p>
                
                
                
                <p>more you know the more she&#39;ll suffer for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>your decisions. She already dealt with it once. We miss her scent near us. You don&#39;t want it to happen again. Watch your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no signature no context. We assumed it was rogues but it could be her old pack. We&#39;ve heard from other packs that her old pack has been calling around to see if she stumbled into their pack. We still haven&#39;t gotten a call but I think they&#39;re going to call us last. We&#39;re known to not let anyone into our pack. Titus is already protective over her that he will go as far as to ignore her for her sake. I told him he was stupid but he won&#39;t listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but I want to get to know the future Luna,&#34; I smirk. I know Titus hasn&#39;t talked to her about that yet but almost all of the pack knows already. Titus made a big announcement about how unmatted males were to stay away from her. That was also stupid because she&#39;s not allowed to leave this house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; she said suspiciously. &#34;What&#39;s your favorite color?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Red.&#34; &#34;What&#39;s your favorite food?&#34; I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spaghetti,&#34; she smiles. I&#39;m</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Is she talking?&#39; Titus asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Yes now stop pestering me I&#39;m doing this for you,&#39; I say then block my mind link. I didn&#39;t mind talking to Soph. She seems like a person I could become great friends with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um...Have you found your mate?&#34; She asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, she hasn&#39;t shown up yet,&#34; I smile. I haven&#39;t been looking for her if she shows up she shows up. I don&#39;t mind waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any siblings?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, a Brother and a sister. James is 21 and Laura is 5,&#34; she says pointing at her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, James Moretti?&#34; I asked. I swear that name sounded so familiar. James? Oh from Beta camp. He was a strong one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah?&#34; She said confirming my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went to Beta camp with him,&#34; I say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; She said getting excited. &#34;Are you the Brody Montgomery he was always talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised,&#34; I laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh he told me all the stories of how y&#39;all pranked everyone,&#34; she laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he tell you about the prank with the oil and feathers?&#34; I laugh remembering that prank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; she laughs. And we stay like that laughing talking about the old days.</p>
