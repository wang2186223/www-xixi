                <p>I felt the chains that held me up to the wall. I fell to the ground having no will to keep going. The hair fell over my face and my cut-up clothes barely covered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to eat before they get back,&#34; I heard a voice say. I was lifted and the smell of fresh food made my mouth drool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to eat this not shatter the plate,&#34; the lady said and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; I blurt out. She turns around confused. I got to see her face and knew I would never forget her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34; I ask her quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wake up Sophia,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wake up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>End of Flashback</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open my eyes and see a very shirtless Titus in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your family is on pack lands we need to get ready they should make it to the pack lands in an hour,&#34; he says tapping me. I let out a groan and turned the other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me 5 more minutes,&#34; I mumble. I didn&#39;t get a reply so I assumed he left me so I could sleep a little bit longer. Suddenly there was a cold shock across my body. I sit up and my body was soaking wet in cold ass water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Titus!&#34; I growl at him. He gave me a small smirk and shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You obviously wouldn&#39;t get up if I yelled at you so I found a different method,&#34; he laughs. I grumble and throw my legs off the side of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now my bed is wet. Where the heck am I going to sleep?&#34; I ask him now in a mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you can always sleep in my room,&#34; he smirks. I roll my eyes get up and walk in the bathroom. I grab the towel off the rack and wipe my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh now I need to shower,&#34; I mumble to myself. I quickly take a shower and wrap the towel around me. I step out of the bathroom and walk into my closet. I didn&#39;t feel the need to dress fancy but my wolf told me we would eventually be Luna so I might as well dress like it. I wear a pair of white jeans and a cute top. I walked out and Titus was sitting on my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here put this on,&#34; he said throwing a sweatshirt in my face. It smelt entirely of him and it sent my wolf on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; I said trying to control my wolf. She loved the smell of him and it was intoxicating to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that everyone knows that you are mine,&#34; he says getting up. I throw the hoodie on and he put his arm around my waist. We walked outside and someone jumped in front of me and shouted. I scream and jump backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;BRODY!&#34; I yell at him and smack him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paybacks a bitch,&#34; he laughs. I groaned and considered beating him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not in the fucking mood today,&#34; I mumble and lean my head, Titus. Is it the time of the month?&#34; I heard Brody ask Titus. I let out a low growl and Brody looks away and pretends like he didn&#39;t hear anything. We walked on the rock path to the pack house and I realized something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does your pack know about me?&#34; I ask Titus. I haven&#39;t seen any of his pack members except a few warriors, Charlotte, and those three idiots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I made an announcement this morning while you were in the shower,&#34; he says looking down at me. I give him a slight nod and we come up to the back door of the pack house. We walked in and everyone in the kitchen stopped. It looked like ours but larger. Maybe a community kitchen? Everyone was looking at us and I felt embarrassed so I hid my face in Titus&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are y&#39;all looking at?&#34; Titus asks in his Alpha tone. Everyone immediately stopped staring and went back to what they were doing before. Titus started into space the looked back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re in the front,&#34; he tells me. I nod and we start walking through the large pack house. We walk through several doors. I hear murmurs from people as we walk through the pack house. I sighed accepting the fact that this was going to be a common reaction from now on. I turn the corner and see my family and Terry with his slut at the front with Jacob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SOPHIA,&#34; James screamed. He ran over to me and embraced me in a large bear hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey James,&#34; I laugh and hug him back. The impact of him running at me made me land on the ground. I heard Titus growl but then stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you ever leave again, I&#39;m gonna give you an ass beating,&#34; he scolded helping me up. I looked behind him and Terry and I made eye contact. I let in a sharp breath and looked back at James.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m staying here. I can&#39;t go back,&#34; I mumble to him. He looked at me like I was crazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why your home is with us and Mom and Dad are back at the pack too and you can find your mate,&#34; James rambled. Titus let out another growl and realization poured on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already found your mate,&#34; he whispers. I nod and he gives me a big hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations little sister,&#34; he smiles. Then there was another growl. Louder and more dominant. I looked behind James and saw Terry growling while Kira looked shocked. My parents were confused but smiled lightly at me. Titus quickly pulled me away from James and held my waist tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mine,&#34; Titus growled. He was angered that there could be a threat against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;SHE&#39;S MY MATE,&#34; Terry roars. Confusion plastered James and my parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;YOU REJECTED HER YOU HAVE TO RIGHT TO CALL HER YOURS,&#34; Titus fought back. I turned around and put my hand on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down,&#34; I whisper. &#34;Look at me.&#34; He keeps his gaze on Terry and then eventually looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to leave you. I&#39;m staying here,&#34; I whisper to him. His eyes seemed to soften at the sight of me. He stuck his nose in the crook of my neck and inhaled my scent. My heart rate picked up from our skin touching and the need for him grew. Damn, mate pull. He looked up and I heard Terry growl louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you continue to be a threat to this pack&#39;s Luna you will be escorted off these pack lands,&#34; Titus says gaining his composure back. Terry huffed and Kira grabbed his arm and hooked onto him. I moved away from Titus and walked up to Terry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I, Sophia Moretti, accept your rejection,&#34; I said. It felt like a huge burden was lifted off my shoulders. My wolf had a sly grin on her face and she was overly excited that we finally had gotten rid of him. Or so we thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like I just stabbed his heart. Kira looked like slapping me for stealing her man but I couldn&#39;t care less. I walk to my parents and give them a big hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for leaving without explanation,&#34; I apologize. I met their eyes with tears in theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve found your mate and you&#39;re all grown up. I&#39;m so proud of you,&#34; my dad says smiling. My wolf and I beamed with pride. All we wanted to hear was that my parents were proud of us. My mom pushed the stray piece of hair behind my ear and kissed my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re so so proud of you,&#34; she smiles and looks at me. I smile and give her a big hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I whisper to them. They give me a small nod and I walk back to Titus. Jacob walks back with me probably feeling awkward about everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I wouldn&#39;t have invited him if I knew,&#34; Jacob apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine there was no way that you would&#39;ve known.&#34; I get back to Titus&#39; side and he wraps an arm around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you wanna show them the pack house?&#34; He asks me. I haven&#39;t seen any of the pack house till now so I don&#39;t mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I haven&#39;t seen any of it so sure,&#34; I say and he motions for everyone to follow him. We walk through the massive pack house while he&#39;s telling everyone where things are. His office was placed on the third floor as well as Brody&#39;s and Jacob&#39;s. We start walking out to the training grounds for pack members when a loud siren goes off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rouges,&#34; Titus mumbles. &#34;Beta Brody will continue this tour. I have some business to take care of.&#34; He starts to off but I grab his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me come,&#34; I plead. I needed a release from being next to Terry the whole day. It&#39;s angered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I can&#39;t risk you getting hurt,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can take it. I put Brody on his ass the other day. You either let me come with you now or I will sneak out of here and find you myself. You also said that I was not to leave your sight,&#34; I smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She usually handles rouges with me at my pack,&#34; James adds sticking up for me. I turn around and give him a light smile. Titus lets out a few grumbles and then nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there is even a scratch on you when we&#39;re done you&#39;re not allowed to come anymore,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I huff and roll my eyes. I was about to shift but then remembered Titus&#39; hoodie. I quickly take it off and toss it in Jacob&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t lose this,&#34; I tell him then shirt into my wolf. Titus&#39; jet-black wolf waited for us on the edge of the forest. We dashed through the forest getting closer and closer to the border where they were supposedly spotted. It confused me because I didn&#39;t smell them at all. We come to a stop and I see Titus looking around. A large growl came from behind me and I saw a large gray wolf in the air coming at me. I swiftly move to the side and clamp my jaw around his neck. There were maybe 6 more rouges left. Their smell suddenly overpowered my senses. How? I couldn&#39;t smell them just now. I didn&#39;t have time to think because they came charging at us. Wasn&#39;t there a border patrol here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>4 came at me and the others went for Titus. They circled me and my wolf stood in the middle eyeing their movements. The first brown one jumped first and was in the air. He landed on my back and I threw him off. He slid to the side and hit a tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second wolf didn&#39;t hesitate he was already charging at me. He hit my side and it made me stumble. I let out a low growl and immediately got back up. The same brown wolf came at me and I dove under him and tore out and took his leg in my mouth and dug my teeth in till it reached the bone. He let out a whimper and I took this chance to jump up on him and snap his neck. I see Titus killing off the last of the two rouges that were after him and charging at the other two that were watching me. I attack the 2nd wolf and ram my head into his side. He let out a growl and tried snapping at my neck. I quickly dodge his canines and slide to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stood there eying each other moving in circles. I let my canines show and ran towards him. He charged at me at the same time. We both jumped in the air and I grabbed his neck midair and snapped it. I land on top of him and look to find Titus. He stood their blood covering his mouth. My wolf rushed to him and started licking his face clean. If I could blush right now it would be beet red. I pull her back and shift back to skin. I quickly find clothes and come out and see Titus standing there clothed too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hurt?&#34; He asks scanning me for injuries. He looked at my legs and arms looking for any sign of cuts or bruises but I held up well. I wasn&#39;t going down that easy without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I say shooing him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just making sure,&#34; he says then wrapping his hand around my shoulder. We proceeded to walk back to the pack house then the scent of blood filled my senses. At first, I thought it was Titus but it kept getting stronger. I&#39;m the distance I saw the source of the blood. A torn-up lady in the distance lay on the ground. I quickly run over and look at her. I take a look at her face and gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amelia?&#34;</p>
