                <p>Sophia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at Titus and then look away. I felt the bond try to push us towards each other. I let out a shaky breath and looked away from his captivating eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch her for a few my wolf needs a release,&#34; I mumble to Jacob and walk out and slam the door on my way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia?&#34; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to go into the woods right now. The rogue attacks are increasing and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s safe for you,&#34; I heard Jacob call after me. I freeze in my position and sigh. I put my back up to the wall and sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; I huff. I just needed a break away from Titus. I walk around the pack house meeting the pack. I might as well since Titus isn&#39;t doing it. I look out the large windows and accidentally bump into someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; I say looking at the girl. She looked at me in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch where you&#39;re going,&#34; she spat. I look at her surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch how you&#39;re talking pup,&#34; I say back to her. Realization rushes over her face and she smirks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Sophia. The rejected slut he chose over me. I should have been his Luna and he knows that,&#34; she growls at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch your tongue. You have about 4 different scents of males on you so don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m a slut,&#34; I growl louder. She rolls her eyes and leans on her back foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wants me. He always has you just got in the way. I&#39;ll make sure you won&#39;t be able to again,&#34; she says and walks away. I scoff and walk the other way. I look at the time and it&#39;s been an hour or so. I walk back to Titus&#39; office and Tala runs to me. I give her a smile and tell Jacob goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is my mommy coming back?&#34; She asks me. My heart broke for her. I didn&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll come back at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know but we&#39;ll find her okay?&#34; She nods and leans her head on my shoulder. She went limp in my arms and her breathing evened out. I opened the door to the house and lay her on my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pick up the phone next to my bed and dial for Brody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; I heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you done with all your pack work I really need a release of my anger,&#34; I whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are we whispering,&#34; he whispers through the phone. I roll my eyes and sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tala is sleeping right now and I&#39;m next to her,&#34; I say. He made a sound of realization and I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah I&#39;m just going through my last papers for a new pack member I&#39;ll be done in a few minutes and I&#39;ll come,&#34; he says. I nod then realize that he couldn&#39;t see me. I mentally slap myself and go back to talking to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Who&#39;s the new pack member?&#34; I ask in curiosity. Tala started to shift in the bed and a made a point to talk quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t Titus tell you? We&#39;re making Tala an official member of the pack.&#34; I almost dropped my phone. This was important how could he not tell me? Maybe that&#39;s what he wanted to tell me last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll see you in a few,&#34; I say and hang up. I placed the pack phone down and walked outside, shutting the door quietly on the way out. I walk to the island and see a note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dear Luna,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to leave to attend to my duties at the pack house. Please forgive me for having to leave. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow Luna. I sigh and let out a chuckle. She didn&#39;t need to apologize or call me Luna. I set the note down and went to get orange juice. I opened the fridge and there was no sign of orange juice. I groan when I look in the trash and see the empty bottle of orange juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should really try to drink water sometimes. Orange juice all the time is bad for you,&#34; I heard someone say from beside me. I screamed and landed my fist on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brody you can&#39;t do that to me,&#34; I scream at him. He laughs holds his jaw and looks at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hah, now we&#39;re even. Except I didn&#39;t attack you when you scared me,&#34; he points out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually if I remember correctly. You continued to chase me around the house and tried to make me say &#39;Brody is the manliest man&#39;,&#34; I contradict. He laughs and points at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just said it.&#34; I roll my eyes at his childish acting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait I need someone to watch Tala while I&#39;m out,&#34; I realize. I couldn&#39;t move her so someone would have to come here and watch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can go and get one of the omegas to watch her while we&#39;re out,&#34; Brody says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t be necessary,&#34; I heard beside me. I screamed again and went to punch the person again but they caught my hand. His touch sent sparks up my arm and made me shiver. How did I not smell him come in? Maybe it&#39;s because everything here smells like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take Sophia out and spar with her you can watch Tala,&#34; he says pointing at him. He groans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m stuck on babysitting duty?&#34; He pouts and grumbles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When she wakes up make sure she gets something to eat and while she&#39;s sleeping can you get someone to get more orange juice?&#34; I ask. He nods and spaced out, probably mind-link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to say goodbye to your family first,&#34; Titus whispers in my ear sending shivers down my spine. The mate pull made me want to make him take me right there, but I knew I was not ready for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod and he leads me out of the house and towards the driveway of the pack house. My family was standing there and Terry stood there with Kira. She had bags under her eyes probably from all the crying. James looked at me and his face lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re leaving so fast?&#34; I smirk. He nods sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I could stay longer and hang out with you but there&#39;s issues we have to deal with back at the pack,&#34; he explains. I nod and give him a big hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure you visit and have time for us when you&#39;re Luna,&#34; he whispers. I give him a light smile and look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could never not have time for you in my life,&#34; I smile. I looked at my parents walked to them and hugged them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure I&#39;ll visit you soon,&#34; I tell them. They nod and smile at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re so proud of you,&#34; my mom says. I smile and lightly nod at both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I whisper. Tears brimming</p>
                
                
                
                <p>my eyes. I didn&#39;t know when I would see them next. I walked to Terry and heard Titus&#39; low growls of disapproval. I dismiss them and walk continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to make a great Alpha,&#34; I tell him. He nods and I see Kira glare at me.</p>
