As dark forces hunt her unique birthmark, they discover she’s the Moon Goddess’s chosen warrior. But salvation demands a price: unleashing powers buried in her blood.</p>

                <p>&#34;Svegliati Sophia it&#39;s your birthday!&#34; My little sister says jumping up on me to get up. I curse in Italian that way my sister doesn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What time is it Laura,&#34; I groan sitting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s 9:34,&#34; she says getting off me and dragging me by your arm. &#34;Mom made you breakfast.&#34; That made me jump out of bed. &#39;Yay I love her breakfast,&#39; my wolf says in my head. &#39;Me too,&#39; I agree. I walk downstairs while Laura jumps down them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HAPPY BIRTHDAY,&#34; my family wishes me. I turn 18 today and I&#39;m supposed to find my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you excited to find your mate?&#34; James, my older brother, smirks. We&#39;re three years apart but everyone says we look like twins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course who isn&#39;t,&#34; I exclaimed. My wolf jumps in my head at the word &#39;mate&#39;. We&#39;ve been excited since we first met each other when I shifted at 15. &#39;I wonder what he&#39;s going to be like. Maybe he&#39;s tall. Is he even in the pack?&#39; My wolf started wondering as she paced in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad is doing pack work with Alpha Ken at the pack house,&#34; Mom said. I sigh not surprised. My dad is beta so, he&#39;s barely around, and when he does he always sleeps. We live separately from the pack house cause mom wanted privacy from all the other wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;ll be here for your party and Alpha, Luna, and Terry will be there too,&#34; she adds. I internally groan when she says that. He and I used to be friends until other people, wait, everyone in our school wanted to be friends with the &#39;Alpha&#39;s son&#39;. He eventually found a girlfriend and didn&#39;t wait for his mate. I feel bad for anyone who&#39;s his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to go on a run I&#39;ll be back in time,&#34; I say walking into my room to grab a bag I undress outside stuff my clothes into the bag, and leave it on the porch. Nudity is normal around us wolves it just feels weird in front of my family. I shift into my dark silver wolf and start towards the forest. My wolf went down the path she usually takes. It leads to a pasture where she sometimes meets my friend&#39;s wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I get to the pasture and see Maya&#39;s wolf sitting there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HAPPY BIRTHDAY BITCH,&#34; she minds links me as her wolf tackles mine. Our wolves mess around for a while as she and I have a conversation in our private mind link. We talk about what I think our mate will be like. For what seems like a short time, it&#39;s been a few hours. I look at the sky and see the sun start to set. Maya and I say our goodbyes and we start to head back. I shift back and change before I walk into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sophia?&#34; I heard Mom ask from her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah?&#34; I call back grabbing a cookie from the jar and stuffing it into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have an hour to get ready,&#34; she shouts back. I wish she wouldn&#39;t shout that much, especially with our sensitive hearing. That was a big problem when James was going through puberty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into my room and took out the outfit I was going to wear. I didn&#39;t put too much makeup on because it always feels cakey on my face. As I was getting ready, there was a knock on the door. I opened it and it was my dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad,&#34; I smiled hugging him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Happy birthday tesoro,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(Sweetheart)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready?&#34; He asks waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup,&#34; I smile and walk with him out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I walk outside I hear cheers for me. I give a soft laugh of nervousness. I made my rounds with everyone and talked with them. Since I am the Beta&#39;s daughter my birthday is a big deal. After a few hours, I caught the scent of a heavenly smell of chocolate mixed with cinnamon. I look around and lock eyes with Terry. My wolf jumps around in my head repeating the one word I didn&#39;t want to hear when I look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Mate,&#39; she says excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry&#39;s eyes flashed black with anger then back to his regular eyes. He walks off from Kira, his girlfriend grabs my arm and drags me into my house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are not fit to me my Luna,&#34; he spits into my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-But you my m-mate,&#34; I stutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter I have Kira to be by my side when I become Alpha.&#34; Before I can say anything, he cuts me off with something that is rarely heard of in the werewolf world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I Terry Moore reject you, Sophia Moretti, as my mate and future Luna,&#34; he says each word piercing my heart. And with that, he walks off joining back to the party. I felt the connection to my wolf disappear as she whimpered at the fact our mate rejected us. I couldn&#39;t handle the pain I was feeling in the pit of my stomach. I looked at the backyard and the front door. The pain was too much for me to handle. I couldn&#39;t bear to see him again so I took off out the door into the forest. When I could see the pack border, I mind linking my family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m leaving for a few days I&#39;ll be fine don&#39;t worry about me.&#34; I make it quick and block my mind link. As I cross the pack border I could feel the ties with the pack break. My wolf whimpers as the ties with my family and friends break away from me. I was now a rogue. I had no plan to come back and face Terry again. I don&#39;t want to be under the rule of my mate who rejected me. I don&#39;t need a reminder every day knowing no one wants me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Mate rejected us,&#39; she cries in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I know, he&#39;s not worth it,&#39; I try to say with confidence but it came out weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(Hours later)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t stop running for one minute. My legs were in so much pain that I couldn&#39;t feel them anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m sorry,&#39; I whisper to my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She doesn&#39;t respond. In that second, I felt a sharp pain in my abdomen. I collapse and roll into a tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Heat,&#39; my wolf tells me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I thought it was going to come later than that,&#39; I say frantically. The pain got worse worse every minute. In the distance, I heard a few howls. Wolves. There was a low growl a few feet away from me. I started to shift back into human from the immense pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shift,&#34; the low voice commanded as I already was shifting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Titus&#39; POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was contacted by border patrol and they smelled a rogue nearing the border. My wolf starts to stir in my head at the mention of that specific rogue. I contact my beta and gamma to meet me at the border. As I approach, the dark silver wolf wincing laying on their stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shift,&#34; I command using my Alpha tone while she was already shifting back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;She smells like you,&#39; I mind linking my Beta, Brody. He gives me a look of confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Not exactly like you. She just smells like your position in this pack as Beta,&#39; I say clearing up the confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Maybe she&#39;s a daughter of a Beta,&#39; my Gamma chimes in the mind link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What pack are you from,&#34; I ask forcefully using my Alpha tone again. She tries to say something but it comes out as a mumble. She looked up and when our eyes met her, I heard my wolf repeat a word I thought I&#39;d never hear again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Mate&#39;</p>
