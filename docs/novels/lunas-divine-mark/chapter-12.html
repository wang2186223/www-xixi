                <p>Sophia&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stay in the bathroom with my back against the wall for a while. I run my hand through my hair and finally get up. I look in the mirror and wash my face. I let out a big sigh as I walked out. I felt the link towards my wolf weaken as she disappeared somewhere in my mind. I walk down the hall knowing Titus was nowhere near. His scent was in the house but it wasn&#39;t fresh. I looked down at my shirt and it was wet from all my crying. It kept replaying in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t want me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He never wanted me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He should have left me to die&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to do everything in my power to not start crying again. I take the orange juice out of the fridge and pour myself a glass. I decided I was going to drown my sorrows in juice. I continued to drink my juice but then an unfamiliar scent filled the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately freeze and get up. I found the closest object I could find and it was a dirty frying pan from this morning&#39;s breakfast. I hide under the counter and see a buff guy walk into the kitchen. He was fairly tall and had dirty blonde hair with green eyes. I mentally groaned because there was no way I could beat him in a fight. He looked like he had a skill much higher than mine. I waited till he was a few feet in front of where I was hiding then I let out a growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It came out softer than I liked it too but my wolf was currently M.I.A. I lifted the frying pan and swung. I looked up and saw that he moved out of the way. I started to swing again but then he lowered his head in submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna,&#34; he said, &#34;Alpha Titus sent me to check up on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grumble a few cuss words and lay the frying pan down. Of course, he would send someone to make sure I&#39;m okay. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m not capable of protecting myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34; I ask walking back to my juice. I let the last sip roll down the glass and onto my mouth. I pour myself some more and sit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is Nikolai, Luna,&#34; he says politely. I nod and he continues to stand in his original position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can call me Sophia if you&#39;d like. I&#39;m not used to the fact I&#39;m Luna,&#34; I explain to him. He shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been instructed to only call you by your position,&#34; he tells me. I sigh. Of course, he would do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about this you can call me Sophia whenever he&#39;s not around and it&#39;ll be our secret,&#34; I offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright Sophia,&#34; he nods. I give him a soft smile and finish another cup of juice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know where Titus is?&#34; I ask him. He nods and runs his fingers through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s in his office. I recommend not going near him his office is his punching bag right now,&#34; he explains. I nod and get up. Of course, he was angry with himself. I know he didn&#39;t mean it but something at the back of my head tells me that he did mean it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolai? Were you instructed to be my guard for the day?&#34; I ask him. I didn&#39;t want someone following me the whole day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Sophia Titus told me to make sure you didn&#39;t get into any trouble with the pack members,&#34; he says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That fucker,&#34; I mumble. I wasn&#39;t even planning to leave my room today. My family is here and I can&#39;t even see them without being watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I allowed to leave this house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes but I have to come with you,&#34; he says. I let out a groan and walked to my room. I keep a close eye on him and he stands in front of my room door. I silently thanked the moon god that he wasn&#39;t coming into my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lay on my bed thinking about what I should do with the rest of my day. I couldn&#39;t talk to Titus because of our fight. I felt my wolf slightly long for him but I controlled her. Stupid mate pull. I wondered if my brother was busy. Maybe he could train with me like how we did before I left. I walked out of my room looked to my right and saw Nikolai.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we go to the pack house?&#34; I ask him. He spaced out for a second and nodded. I assumed he mind-linked someone. I quickly changed into a tank top and shorts. I walk out and skip down the hallway. I take my scrunchie and tie my hair into a high ponytail. I follow the path towards the pack house and walk through the back door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone stopped and looked at me. Either it was because they knew I was the Alpha&#39;s mate or it was that I smelled like a rouge. I sigh and walk past them. I pick up the scent of James and follow it to a large room. I find him sitting by himself on his phone. I run up to him and slap his phone out of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; He shouted at me. I roll my eyes at how dramatic he is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come train with me I&#39;m bored,&#34; I groan. He picks his phone off the ground and nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey outsider who&#39;s that hot chick with you,&#34; I heard someone ask. I turn around and see a guy, maybe 17. He looks at me up and down and lets out a growl of approval. I give him a disapproving scowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you,&#34; James says in a warning tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you going to do about it? It&#39;s not like you can attack me. You&#39;re not even from this pack,&#34; he spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna we should get to the training grounds,&#34; I heard Nikolai say. I smirk when I see the guy&#39;s face morph into horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait as in Alpha Titus&#39; Luna? Are you the Sophia Moretti?&#34; He asks frantically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think Titus is in a good mood today so I recommend you don&#39;t get yourself into trouble by messing with me,&#34; I tell him. He lowers his head in submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Luna,&#34; he apologizes. James grabs my arm and leads me out of the pack house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna the training grounds are empty today,&#34; Nikolai mentions. I nod and walk towards the training grounds. I had an idea of where it was from when we were walking around. I found the large clearing and, like Nikolai said, it was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have the whole area to ourselves,&#34; he smiles fake punching me. I run to the middle of the area and James follows too. He pulls his shirt over his head and throws it to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise to go easy on you,&#34; I smirk as I kick my shoes off. He rolls his eyes at me and laughs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please you&#39;ve put me on my ass once,&#34; he says. I smile remembering that day. It was maybe two weeks before I left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was before I left so I could still be better than you,&#34; I point out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was sick that day and I let you win,&#34; he pouts. I roll my eyes and laugh. I glance at Nikolai as he watches us argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you lead the spar?&#34; I ask him. He nods and shifts places so he can see better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright y&#39;all fight till one submits and no shifting until I say so,&#34; he yells. I didn&#39;t see the point since there were only three of us here. We both nod keeping eye contact. He yells go and I felt my wolf&#39;s power seeping back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You&#39;re a little late,&#34; I grumble at her. James and I circle each other not breaking eye contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m sorry that mate hurt me,&#39; she growled back. I didn&#39;t feel like fighting with her too so I just accepted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on Sophia are you too scared to make the first move?&#34; James taunts. I watch him closely eyeing his footing. We started to inch closer together until I saw him plant his right foot on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always steps before he punches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a blow to my stomach but I move to the side and he stumbles to the side. I took this chance and sent a hard jab to his right side. He catches my arm after I make contact with his side. He flings me over his back and onto mine. I groan as the wind from my lungs is knocked out. As we continue punching and kicking and flinging, I notice people start to watch. I heard people mumbling and whispering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James threw a punch to my face but I was quicker. I grab his fist and uppercut his stomach. He stumbles backward and quickly catches himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shift,&#34; I heard Nikolai yell finally. I smirk and jump into the air. I was the first to shift while James was comprehending what was happening. My wolf came out and landed perfectly on her paws letting out a loud growl of dominance. I noticed people lowering their heads in submission as they felt the power of my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James quickly shifted into his chocolate brown that matched his hair. He let out a growl and digs his paw onto the ground. She charges at him and rams her head into him. His canines found fur and clamped his jaw down on my leg. She lets out a pain-filled groan. She clamps her canines into his shoulder and claws his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a presence behind me that made the hair on my neck stuck up. My wolf felt a pull towards it but we were too focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flung her over to the side and my wolf slid until hitting a tree. She was pissed. She let out a growl of annoyance and stood up. Her legs were weak but with the adrenaline rushing through her she couldn&#39;t tell. She pounced in the air and pounced onto his back. Her paws kept him in place. He tried to bite at my paws but I pushed him further into the dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf growled telling him to submit. He refused and growled back. I dug my paw into his neck and let out a small wimpier. Accepting defeat he showed his neck in submission. I got off of him and slowly sank. My legs gave out and I started to shift back. My wolf only used half her strength not feeling up to the fight since the fight between Titus and me. She was weaker and I had to suffer the consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt something thrown over me to cover me. I look up and see James standing over me with shorts already on. Scratches littered his body from his chest to his legs. I sat up and quickly threw the shirt on. He gives me a hand and I grab it pulling me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did good little sister,&#34; he says congratulating me. I looked down and blood seeped through the shirt making it stick to my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve put you on your ass twice now,&#34; I smile feeling a sense of pride. He nods and I look around. People surrounded the training grounds just to watch us spar. Through the midst of people, I saw Titus leaning against a tree. My wolf swelled with pride knowing that he saw us just put my older brother down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk off the training grounds with Nikolai still following me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re strong Luna,&#34; he tells me. I nod weakly. My wolf gave me a lot of pain. If I am barely walking because Titus and I got into a tiny fight. How the fuck am I supposed to lead with the whole pack on my shoulders.</p>
