                <p>For a second her eyes dimmed as she stared at me. &#34;I could always tell when you were lying Cassie. Your face gives you away. Tell me what&#39;s been going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew she meant well but I suddenly couldn&#39;t breathe. How could I tell her everything that was going on in my life? She had been asleep for most of it. Hell she was only awake and alive now because of the sacrifices I was making.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that I could ever tell her any of that. She would blame herself. When in reality the only person who was to blame was me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were the decisions I had made and I would have to live with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would live with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is Julian?&#34; She asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to smile. &#34;He&#39;s fine.&#34; I lied. Truth was I had no idea how he was. I hadn&#39;t seen him since the night we had eaten together. I could have almost forgotten he existed if it wasn&#39;t for the fact he had made me lose my job and I had to spend the evening on his arm, pretending I was madly in love with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong Cassie?&#34; Cocking her head to the side she studied me. She had always been very perceptive and now was no different. She knew I was hiding something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mothers top lip thinned slightly. &#34;Are things between you and Julian not going well? I told your dad when the arrangement were first made that you two should meet first. You were very different even when you were children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no mam. Me and Julian are just fine.&#34; Beaming at her the lies just kept coming. &#34;We had a beautiful dinner together the other night.&#34; One where I had acted like an ass, threw up and then realised my period was late I added silently .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good.&#34; She didn&#39;t sound so sure. &#34;And tonight?&#34; She motioned to the dress I was wearing. &#34;You look very beautiful. Are you going out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes to a party with Julian.&#34; My cheeks were starting to hurt because I was forcing myself to smile so much.  Lying really was exhausting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I lead the full moon run with him at the palace.&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mothers head snapped up. And real interest flickered into her eyes. &#34;Was your dad proud?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy wasn&#39;t there.&#34; I admitted and instantly regretted it as her face fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not so much mam. But I&#39;ve been busy with work and-&#34; I grinned with a wink. &#34;Then obviously I&#39;ve been spending most of my free time with Julian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I so desperately needed her to believe that everything was fine. I didn&#39;t want her feeling bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen him either.&#34; Her voice dropped and the pain in it pierced my heart. I hated that she was hurting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He hasn&#39;t come to visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sure he has just been busy but I will talk to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want you to force him to come and visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She broke my heart with the sadness in her voice. Reaching over I pressed my lips to her cheek and they were wet with tears that I hadn&#39;t noticed were falling from her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course he wants to come Mamma.&#34; I hated seeing her like this. So broken. She had been through so much already and now she deserves to be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would make sure she was happy. Even if it meant I had to drag him here personally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll get him to visit.&#34; I promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind us someone cleared their throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; Ian nodded his head politely, and then grinned at my mother. Striding forward he held out his hand. &#34;Cassie, you never said you had an even better looking sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the bed my mother giggled and blushed like a school girl and I shot him a look of thanks. He had said just the right thing. He had made her feel beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unfortunately I am going to have to drag Cassie away.&#34; He gave me a pointed look and my heart sank. I knew that look , it meant I was about to deal with Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian is waiting in the car.&#34; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning over my mother again I kissed her cheek again. &#34;Get some rest mamma. I&#39;ll be back tomorrow. Hopefully with daddy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian shot me a look at my blatant lie but he didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian let me lead the way and the moment I stepped out in to the slight drizzle I knew why. Julian wasn&#39;t in the car. He was waiting for me outside of it. Leaning on the door and looking as dashing as a supermodel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nurses rushed passed, eyeing him hungrily. It made me roll my eyes. If only they knew the ugliness hidden behind his handsome face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened when he saw me and there was a flicker of admiration in his eyes when he looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look be- presentable .&#34; Sliding his hand over my hip he pulled me into him and his face descended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted my face expectantly , and my eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s laugh was mocking and the kiss I had expected never materialised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes flew open and his laughing face filled my sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You thought I was going to kiss you, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pouted. I hated the mocking tone in his voice. I hated it just as much as I hated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile was knowing. Opening the door he gestured for me to get into the back of the limo. Sliding in next to me and closing the door. As soon as the door slammed shut it was like we were in a dark bubble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bubble of two. Where we were alone and wrapped in warm darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It looked like you wanted me to kiss you.&#34; He said quietly and I jumped as his hand came down on my knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to him I met his eyes in the darkness. They were glowing or maybe that was just my imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ask me.&#34; He ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ask you what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand slid further up my thigh. Bunching the satin of my dress under his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To kiss you.&#34; Julian&#39;s voice had turned low and husky. The voice of a man hell bent on seducing rje woman in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you ask me nicely enough then I will give you what you so desperately need.&#34; His eyes glittered. &#34;You do need it don&#39;t you? I mean a woman like you has-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At my side my hand clenched  into a fist. I desperately wanted to slap him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would rather die that kiss you Mr-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyebrows shot up. &#34;Did you just call me Mr? I am Julian, your highness or alpha. You will not lower my standing to a plain Mr like I am a normal man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away from him with a sneer. He was infuriating and so self obsessed it was sickening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry your highness alpha Julian.&#34; I said mockingly moving my leg away from him so his hand dropped to the seat between us. &#34;Now shall we get to this party. I don&#39;t want to spend a minute longer with you than I have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then sign the divorce papers .&#34; He snapped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained silent. If only it was that simple.</p>
