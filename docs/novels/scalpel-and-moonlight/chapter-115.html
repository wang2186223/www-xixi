                <p>I had got my wolf at a really young age, much younger than anyone else that I had known but I had never have a shift be so painful before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like every muscle in my body snapped and shattered. I could feel every hair on my body withdraw. And it was agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t scream , there was no chance of that because even though it felt like it was taking hours and hours I knew it was only a split second of agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally in my human form I fell back on the sweat soaked sheets completely spent. It felt like I had just run a hundred miles in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dazed and confused I stared straight upwards and frowned.  Where was I?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in a bed, not my bed it wasn&#39;t comfortable enough but it was still a bed. My brow furrowed even more which only gave me a headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing I remembered was being shackled to a wall and then he had started on about what he was going to do to Cassie and I had broken free only to be-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; Her name left my mouth in a whooshed mumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was moment to the side of me and I tried to turn my head that way but I couldn&#39;t. Infact I couldn&#39;t move much of my body at all. It felt like I was tied down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was I chained somewhere else? Had they laid me down to torture me in new and unusual ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like something in me broke. Not my bones but in my spirit. Like my soul was shattering but not for myself. They could do whatever they wanted to me ,  but my family-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thrashed wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian.&#34; Warm soft hands pressed down on my shoulders firmly, pushing me back into the lumpy mattress. &#34;Hush Julian, it&#39;s me. I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body went rigid as my eyes tried to focus enough to find her face. And there she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; I said her name like a prayer. All breathy and hushed. &#34;Is it really you?&#34; I wanted to reach out and touch her cheek to make sure she wasn&#39;t some sort of hallucination but my arms were bound to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me and you are  safe. Just try and stay still ok. I&#39;m going to get a light so I can check the stitches after your shift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a rustling and I cried out. I wanted to grab her and never let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t go.&#34; I croaked instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassies sigh was loud but she didn&#39;t leave. Instead she sat on fhe edge of the bed and stared down at me. Caressing me with her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; She finished for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because we freed you.&#34; Cassie said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flowed through me, almost forcing me to shift again. &#34;You did what?&#34; I seethed. &#34;Why would you do that? I told you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning over me her eyes flashed. &#34;You were dying. Stuck to the wall like a butterfly with a pin. What did you expect me to do? Just leave you there to die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth to speak and then shut it again with a snap. Searching the shadows of her face I sighed heavily. &#34;Why not? I would think me being dead would be a gift after everything I did to you.&#34; My voice cracked. &#34;How I treated you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; Cassie said quietly. &#34;I should hate you but-&#34; almost timidly she reached across my chest and ran her fingers softly down my cheek. &#34;But I don&#39;t. Not enough to leave you to die anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t hate me that much but I am still angry at you Cassie. You put yourself in unnecessary danger for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassies sigh was loud. &#34;I think I&#39;ve been in danger from the moment we got married Julian. And I&#39;m sure we are stronger together. At least until we get your throne back. After that-&#34;  in the darkness I saw her shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you by my side. Now I know-&#34; my voice broke. I couldn&#39;t help it. She was mine. I just hadn&#39;t realised it. Not until it was too late anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will discuss that when you are better because-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the blood run from my face. It left me lightheaded. &#34;I don&#39;t mean the rejection.&#34; And I hadn&#39;t. I had just wanted her to leave me and save herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Words don&#39;t mean anything.&#34; Another shrug. &#34;Actions mean so much more. We don&#39;t live in the dark ages anymore. But we will discuss this another time.&#34; She lifted herself from the bed. &#34;I&#39;m just going to check the stitches quickly. If they aren&#39;t too bad I will let you rest until I change them but if they aren&#39;t-&#34; she glanced behind her. &#34;Well if they aren&#39;t then we will deal with that now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel fine.&#34; I found myself smiling. &#34;I would feel better if you kissed me and laid down next to me. I think we would both sleep better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie gave a tinkering laugh. &#34;I am sure you would but I need to keep an eye on you for infections. I have something to help make sure that doesn&#39;t happen.&#34; She yawned, clapping a hand over her mouth. &#34;Sorry, it&#39;s been a long long few days.&#34; She apologised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then come and lay with me. And why the hell am I tied to the bed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because you kept trying to attack me when I was stitching you up and Ian felt bad about knocking you out all the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ian knocked me out?&#34; I arched an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Several dozen times well maybe not that many. But anyway you stay tied up until we know there&#39;s no infection that will make you hallucinate and go on a rampage. If you need more pillows or blankets to be comfortable then I will get them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared in her general direction. &#34;I am fine. But I would definitely be more comfortable with you by my side. Lay with me Cassie. Just let me be close to you.&#34; That&#39;s what I wanted more than anything. Not to fuck her , just to have her close to me. I knew it would speed up my healing and mend my soul at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t it&#39;s almost four am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. &#34;What happens then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your sons wake up for their breakfast which is me. So close your eyes. Sleep. Hopefully when you next wake up , you can meet them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meet them? My heart lurched, and skipped a beat. My sons were in this room with me. We were finally all together. It should have filled me with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why did it fill me with dread instead?</p>
