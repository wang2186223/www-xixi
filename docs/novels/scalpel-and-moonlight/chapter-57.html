                <p>Julian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed her without hesitation. I would have kissed her even if she hadn&#39;t asked me to because when I was close to her I either wanted to throttle her or claim her lips with mine. Tonight I wanted to kiss her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than anything I wanted to kiss her and with each kiss take all of her pain and trouble away. I had never wanted anything more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening her lips with mine gently , I used the wash cloth to wipe away the grime of the night from her body. I did it gently because even though she said she was fine I could see in her eyes that she wasn&#39;t really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know exactly what had gone on in that hotel room before I had arrived and I never would know until Cassie herself felt ready to tell me which might be never.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian.&#34; She whimpered when the tips of my fingers brushed the underside of her breast instead of the cloth. It wasn&#39;t a whimper of fear or revulsion. It was the smallest cry of pleasure and need instead and it hit me somewhere in the lower stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cock throbbed against her back. Demanding to be inside of her.  But I couldn&#39;t do that either. I couldn&#39;t be rough and demanding with her. Not tonight. All I could do was caress her , gently and softly as she willingly gave me her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet somehow it was enough. Just holding her and kissing her was enough. A warmth spread through me. Part relief and part contentment and for the first time in so long it felt like I was exactly where I was meant to be. Which was with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving one hand to the back of her head, I tangled my fingers into her wet hair. The tip of my tongue touching hers and dropped the cloth between her thighs. My fingers skimmed against her core and this time she stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes flew open to find her staring at me. A wild dazed look in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; I whispered against her mouth. I had pushed too far and she had withdrawn back into herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except it wasn&#39;t ok. Heaving myself upwards in a surge of water I stepped out of the bath and reached for one of the huge towels that were warning but I didn&#39;t wrap it around me. Instead I held it out for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I had her cocooned inside I lifted her back into my arms. I wasn&#39;t a romantic man. I never had been and I probably never would be but Cassie needed this tenderness right now and I wanted to look after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell I had never wanted to look after anyone more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon I would have to though. Soon I would have a child to look after as well. A kid that wasn&#39;t my wife&#39;s or my mates but was instead -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook the thought away. Laying her down in the middle of her king sized bed I began to pull back the blankets. What Cassie needed now was rest and maybe one of the small finger sandwiches Cathy had made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lay there as sweetly and innocently as a child and then began to cry. Her eyes wide and terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jumping onto the bed next to her I pulled her back into my arms.  &#34;Cassie.&#34; I chanted her name over and over again. Like saying her name was a prayer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t stay here.&#34; Wildly she tried to untangle herself from my arms and it only made me tighten my grip on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why-&#34; my eyes scanned the room and instantly I could see the reason why she was freaking out all of a sudden. The wallpaper was the same colour as in that hotel room of horrors. A slightly different shade but it was enough to trigger her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to sleep in here. We will have another room decorated. It&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swinging her back into my arms I hurried my way to my room. Which didn&#39;t have any green in it at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep in here tonight. With me.&#34; Laying us both in the bed I drew the blankets over us. Cocooning us both in its warmth and darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you stay with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes&#34; I pressed a kiss to the corner of her mouth and the moment I did it was like a damn burst. Her lips parted under mine and she swiped her tongue hungrily against me. Cassie pulled me half on top of her. So she was crushed under my weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; Lazily I stroked down her throat, my fingertips dancing above the swell of her breasts but not going any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly I remembered how she had tensed with my hand between her thighs and I knew she wasn&#39;t ready to try. Whatever happened to her she would need to heal from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I kiss you instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened. &#34;Kiss me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I nodded slowly. &#34;Kiss you everywhere so you remember what it&#39;s like to feel good. I want to kiss away and memory of him touching your body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not waiting for her answer I let my lips slip down her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my time, there was no rush and I wanted her to be able to push me away and tell me no if she needed to.  She didn&#39;t stop me but she watched with her eyes wide open until I reached her pert breasts. Each rosy nipple was perfection. I took my time kissing each one in turn. Drawing them upwards with little flicks of my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moaned softly. Her hands coming down to tangle in my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I loved kissing her I realised. Giving her pleasure was so much better than taking it for myself. And I had another reason as well. By kissing her all over I got to check every inch of her for any signs she was physically hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were a few bruises, nothing to bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was until I came to rest between her thighs. Parting them gently but firmly I started down at her dewy pink folds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even her pussy was perfection. Pink and glistening. But there was some trauma there, a little tear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed down the bile that came rushing up my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing my face into the apex of her thighs I sucked in the sweet aroma of her arousal. And it was almost enough to make me drunk with lust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her firmly I swiped my tongue against her slit. Parting her, kissing her and licking her all at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taste of her exploded all of my senses at once. Every nerve ending I had seemed to zing and bubble up.  She tasted like she smelt but sweeter. I wanted to drown in her juices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her back arched upwards, Cassie rolled her hips in time with my licks. Her hands gripped my hair tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it beautiful. Ride me.&#34; Swirling my tongue over her I gave one last kiss and sucked her throbbing clit into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie screamed, throwing her head back she finally let go and came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I licked up every drop from her pulsing flesh. There was no way I was going to miss even the smallest amount of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally she fell back sated on the mattress. Climbing up her body I kissed her again and settled myself next to her. Leaning on my elbow so I could stare down at her beautiful face and she was beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know how I hadn&#39;t seen it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just nice?&#34; Arching an eyebrow I tucked a wayward strand of hair behind her ear. &#34;You seemed to enjoy it immensely.&#34; I licked my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie blushed. &#34;I did but I feel bad because-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for me. Curling her small hand around the base of my throbbing cock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned. Her hand was so soft and yet so tight about me and she felt so damn good. Cassie always felt good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me help you as well. I owe you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught her wrist in my much larger hand and stopped her from moving it up and down anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t owe me anything Cassie.&#34; Pulling her hand away from me I pressed a kiss to her palm. &#34;If I let you carry on then I am going to want to fuck you and that&#39;s not right. You need to sleep.&#34; Kissing her one last time I shuffled backwards off of the bed. &#34;I want you Cassie but not tonight. Tonight you sleep and heal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared up at me with wide doe like eyes. &#34;You said you would stay with me tonight.&#34; She accused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I will. I will hold you all night if you need me to but I need to shower first and then I&#39;ll grab the food. So if you aren&#39;t asleep you can eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not waiting for her to reply I padded naked into my en-suite. I was going into the shower but not to get clean. I needed the sound of the water to muffle my groans as I fisted my cock and imagined how good it would be to sink into her tight pussy right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I needed the water to wash away the cum I would paint the tiles with when I lost control with her face in my mind.</p>
