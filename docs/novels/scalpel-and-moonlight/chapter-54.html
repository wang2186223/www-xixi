                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t pass out but I couldn&#39;t move. Not even an inch. All I could do was lay there and try to beat down the rising panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was bad. Really really bad. How was I meant to fight back and escape if I couldn&#39;t even move my eyelids to blink?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do love it when they run.&#34; Scooping me up, Bill threw me into the bed where I bounced and landed with my arms and legs twisted and sprawled on either side of my body.  &#34;But no one runs from me.&#34; The mattress dipped down as he knelt to the side of me. &#34;It&#39;s my alpha power you see. The ability to stun people. No one is immune to it. Not you. Not even your husband.&#34; Reaching out he ran his hands down over my now naked breasts. &#34;But don&#39;t worry.&#34; His hands closed around one breast and he squeezed cruelly until it felt like he was going to rip it from my body. &#34;You will be able to feel everything I do to you. Every delicious.&#34; Bill groaned. Laying down by my side he brought his rough lips to my jaw and began to kiss all over my throat and lips. It was like he was wanting me to kiss him back. Or that he thought his mouth on mine somehow made what he was doing to my body better. Maybe in his head it did but it just made me want to be sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You can get through this Cassie. I told myself because even though my body wasn&#39;t working my brain was. And it was whirling a million miles an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you ever been forced to cum.&#34; He hooked one of my knees over his thighs which opened me up to him. I wanted to close my legs and cover myself with everything I had but I couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tip of one of my fingers twitched. My senses were coming back but would they come back soon enough for me to try and escape again or would it be too late by them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you ever had your body betray you like that?&#34; His hand slid from my tits down my stomach and between my thighs. My body tensed. &#34;You will Cassie. I&#39;ll make you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my side my fingers curled into my palm. He saw the movement instantly. &#34;Oh you are a strong one aren&#39;t you but you won&#39;t regain full power in time.&#34; Moving quickly he secured my wrists back to the bed with the remnants of the rope that I had thought I had shreded.  This time he tied them tight, so the rough hessian cut into my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried out hoarsely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you have your voice back as well.&#34; He went back to playing by my side. His hand between my thighs again and this time he was touching me. And I hated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body was screaming to get away but it was more than what ever he had done to me that kept me frozen to the spot. It was my own fear and I hated that just as much as I hated what he was doing to my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good because your cries will be like music to my ears.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers moved over me. Parting me and spreading me open. Bill swiped a finger between my folds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has your husband been inside this sweet cunt of yours?&#34; His words were crude and disgusting they made me feel sick. &#34;Has he stretched you out or are the rumours true? Is his dick like his ability to rule and sadly lacking?&#34; He probed at my entrance, slipping the tip of his finger inside me. &#34;I&#39;ll enjoy your pussy Cassie. I can already feel how tight you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And dry. I wanted to scream. I was bone yard dry. My privates were literally shrivelling up and dying from being touched by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I trailed off as keeping eye contact he removed his hand and spat on his fingers. Coating my pussy with his saliva. He rolled on top of me. His weight crushing me down and then his mouth was on my breasts as he fumbled between our bodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bit around my nipple and I cried out in pain as again he sank his teeth into the delicate flesh of my breasts. He slobbered and kissed every inch of skin that he could get to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I retreated into myself. It was the only thing I could do to keep my sanity. I had to lock myself away. Bill would have my body. He could do whatever he wanted to it but he wouldn&#39;t break me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to make this tight little cunt drip for me.&#34; I could feel pushing at my entrance with his cock and retreated further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would not break me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t allow it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would get through this just like I got through every bad thing in my life and come back stronger than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed as my body didn&#39;t give in to him. Pushing harder. I could feel myself start to tear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fight him Cassie.&#34; My imagination Julian hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I wanted to scream that I couldn&#39;t. I could feel more and more of my body but I couldn&#39;t really move. Not enough to escape or fight back anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Use your brain Cassie. You&#39;re so much more clever than he is. Fight back with your brain. You can do this. Don&#39;t give up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it was imagination but Julian&#39;s voice helped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to hurt both of us if you carry on trying like that.&#34; I said so quietly that I could barely hear my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe I want to hurt you.&#34; He spat on my tits, saliva dribbled from his lips to land on me.  &#34;I want to hear you cry when a real alpha fills you up for the first time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to be sick but I fought back the urge to gag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But do you want to hurt yourself?&#34; I managed to force the words out of my lips. &#34;There&#39;s something in my bag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting himself up he stared down at my face he looked confused. &#34;You have some lube in your bag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have some.&#34; I glanced away. Biting my lip. &#34;Something better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mumbled our a name and his eyes widened even more. &#34;I don&#39;t know what that is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It helps me get in the mood for when Julian wants- &#34; slowly I turned my eyes back to him.  &#34;But I get a little wild so he has to take the -&#34; I giggled. And it was exactly the right thing to do because Bill began to laugh right along with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He can&#39;t keep up with you, hey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well.&#34; I chewed my lip and tried to look submissive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So he needs to take pills to fuck you. I don&#39;t need pills though Cassie.&#34; He pinched my nipple. And I cried out before I could help myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok.&#34; Ignoring the pain I arched my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s almost like you want me to fuck you.&#34; Jumping up bill rushed to grab my bag which had been thrown into the corner. He began to rummage through it. His eyebrows knitted together. &#34;Or is this your attempt to try and catch me off guard.&#34; He brought out two bottles. &#34;Which one is it?&#34; He shook them. &#34;You can&#39;t fight me and win little girl&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I don&#39;t want you to touch me, believe me.&#34; I hissed. &#34;But I know it&#39;s going to happen so -&#34; shrugging I nodded  to the bag in my hands. &#34;Bring it over here. I have a lot of random things in there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a second where I thought he wasn&#39;t going to do it and then he brought it to me and I let out a shaky breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to need at least one hand free otherwise I can&#39;t look through it properly.&#34; I held my breath. Bill looked at me coldly and I thought I had pushed my luck too far but then he moved and untied one wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling my wrist I thanked the goddess that I was gaining my strength back. Digging into the bag I pulled out two white containers. Shaking a small pill from one into my palm. I met Bills eyes,  &#34;Are you sure you want me to take this. I get a little. Uncontrollable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s more or a turn on taking you by force or having you willingly?&#34; He nodded his head. &#34;Take it. I need to-&#34; he groaned as the pill disappeared between my lips. &#34;How wild?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t answer him. &#34;I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give me one.&#34; He ordered instantly, &#34;maybe I&#39;ll take a video of how wild we get together and send it to the Prince.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook another one from the bottle but he was so blind with need to notice it wasn&#39;t the same bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the bottles in my bag were prescriptions, with their proper medical names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one I had taken was nothing more than a prenatal vitamin but the one he just swallowed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well that was something new that I had picked up after he had first attacked me at the hospital.  I didn&#39;t know back then what I would need it for but I had known I needed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t feel anything.&#34; He fell back on top of me. Fingers and hands pawing at my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will soon.&#34; I promised and he would. Soon he would be as powerless as I had just been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had almost been too easy. I had just told him what he wanted to hear and offered to make it easier for him to rape me and he had taken the bait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, whaaa?&#34; Bills voice was slurred. His eyes widened and he tried to push himself off of me. His arms gave out and he fell on top of me making it hard to breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not nice is it, asshole?.&#34; I said between gritted teeth. Twisting my body I got my legs under him and kneed him in the gut sending him sprawling off the bed and onto the floor with a guttural cry. &#34;What have you given me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One of the most powerful tranquillisers in the world.&#34; My hands were shaking as I began to tug at the knots of the other hand. I had to use my teeth on the last bit as it was so tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Falling off the bed I crawled towards him in arms and legs I could barely feel let alone use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Made for shifters. How does it feel-&#34; I slammed my hand into his face sloppily because that&#39;s all I could manage. &#34;Knowing you are completely at my mercy. And that I can hurt you.&#34; I scraped my nails down his face. Raking skin away and leaving bloody marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bill flopped back completely unconscious but I didn&#39;t stop. I kept hitting him and scratching him with everything I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I beat on him until my body sagged and any strength I had evaporated. Dragging myself to my bag I pulled out my phone and tried to phone Forrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forrest was my friend. He would know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please pick up. Please.&#34; I sobbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hotel room door crashed open. Slamming against the wall and rebounding with a boom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I screamed.</p>
