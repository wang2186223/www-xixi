                <p>There was no arguing with him. I tried but he wouldn&#39;t move. In fact he just ignored me and went back to pacing and I could almost hear the wheels in his brain churning away as he tried to think of a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would have been hard enough to get out of the palace without being seen and now we had two newborns as well. It was going to be hard but then again I didn&#39;t understand why we would have to leave at all. I got that he wanted to keep me and the boys safe but Julian was alive. I knew that in my heart and now he was king. We were as safe here in the palace as we were anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ian?&#34; I called as the smallest twin, opened his mouth and gave a little snore. I stared down at them. Both sleeping peacefully. Milk drunk and sated. &#34;Please stop pacing.&#34; It was starting to drive me insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; He turned to me with a rueful smile. &#34;I was just trying to give you some semblance of privacy for their first feed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you said. I think we are well passed that. As you helped me give birth. Did I thank you for that?&#34; I studied him with my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need any thanks. I did my job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you have it.&#34; I said firmly. &#34;You make a good midwife,&#34; I tried to lighten the mood with a small giggle but it only seemed to make the atmosphere worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; He nodded his head politely and I frowned. &#34;Your highness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paled. &#34;Don&#39;t call me that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? It&#39;s your title. Julian is king and you , Cassie are now queen. So you might as well get used to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waved the truth away. &#34;I don&#39;t want you to call me that. We are friends. Goddess I don&#39;t want anyone to call me it. It&#39;s just weird.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You best get used to it.&#34; Pulling a chair up to my bedside he fell on to it heavily with a loud sigh. &#34;I think I have a plan but we can&#39;t leave until you have had a few days rest. But I think we could make it if I fashion some kind of slings to carry the babies. Do they have names yet?&#34; His eyes travelled over them. &#34;I forgot to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet.&#34; I whispered. &#34;I wanted to ask Julian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It might be a while until you see him, Cassie. So start thinking of names because we can&#39;t continue to call them the twins or the babies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll think but I&#39;m sure we will get to Julian and this will all be a big misunderstanding. He will turn up and everything will be ok.&#34; Even to my own ears I sounded deluded. Like a child clutching at straws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe.&#34; Ian said kindly. &#34;Maybe your are right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you don&#39;t think so?&#34; I asked quietly and I was almost afraid to ask him because I already knew the truth. If Julian was fine. If he had taken his place as King he would have come for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I don&#39;t think so. I think something happened and he is staying away or being kept away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan.&#34; I hissed and my hands closed into fists. Megan would have something to do with it.  She always had something to do with it. She had always been jealous of me, that&#39;s why she was so desperate to step into my place. First with my job and then with my husband. She had tried to murder my babies before they were even born.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would she do now if she found us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course it would be Megan. I&#39;m going to kill her.&#34; I ground out between my gritted teeth. I wanted to scream and shout but I didn&#39;t want to wake the babies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced down at them. Ian was right. They did need names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will hopefully get your chance Cassie but taking a life isn&#39;t easy.&#34; He studied me. &#34;I don&#39;t think-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut him off with a growl. &#34;I could do it Ian. After everything she has done to me. I could do it easily. I am not weak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never thought or said you were Cassie. In fact you are the strongest woman I have ever met. But strength comes in many guises and sometimes,&#34; he trailed off for a second. &#34;Sometimes strength comes from mercy. From being true to yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If she has done something to Julian?&#34; I asked. &#34;Could you show her or the people she is working with mercy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian&#39;s human eyes disappeared and for a second a wolf looked out of his human face. &#34;No. Julian is more than my alpha he is my friend.&#34; He blinked and his eyes were his again. &#34;But I am not you.&#34; He grinned and I couldn&#39;t help it. I grinned back. &#34;I&#39;ll kill her for you, if something has happened then I will kill them all. I&#39;ll give my life to keep you and those pups safe. And I will do it gladly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for him. &#34;If you die then Yana will kill me.&#34; I said firmly and was rewarded by a booming laugh. I grimaced back. It was lucky that these rooms were sound proof because we hadn&#39;t exactly been quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah she won&#39;t be too happy but she understands. She knows what risks I need to take. So-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop-&#34; I lashed out with my hand. Gripping his wrist. &#34;I think someone is coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t like I could hear something he couldn&#39;t. His senses were stronger than mine but it was like a sixth sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian cocked his head to the side , his eyes intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t hear-&#34; he froze and a low growl rumbled through his chest. &#34;Can you stand up Cassie?&#34; He said out of the corner of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure. &#34;I guess we are about to find out.&#34; Sliding the babies from my lap I quickly cocooned them in pillows and tenderly climbed to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We may have to fight.&#34; Ian said in a whisper. &#34;I will take on whatever comes through and you-&#34; he glanced behind him and met my eyes. &#34;Take those pups and run.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my head. &#34;If it comes to a fight I will fight with you. There will be no running and no escape and you know it.&#34; I straightened my shoulders and stared into the room. &#34;We will fight together.&#34; I whispered and reached for his hand and the sound of footsteps shuffled closer.</p>
