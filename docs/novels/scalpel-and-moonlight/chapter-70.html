                <p>Julian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Cassie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cathy glanced up at me as I was helped into the house and shrugged off my coat. The shoulders were damp from the short walk from the car to the house and it was making me chilly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome home master.&#34; She helped me , shaking out the coat and moving away to hang it up. It wasn&#39;t any different to any other time she had greeted me at the door but tonight it felt like she was dodging the question. Which meant my wife wasn&#39;t here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At my side my hand clenched into a fist. It would just be Cassie all over if she wasn&#39;t here to take care of me like I needed. Like a wife should.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of doctor was she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A good kind, a small voice hissed at me. It was the same small that had been berating me all day. It sounded very much like my wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve made some soup for you and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is my wife?&#34; I asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cathy&#39;s lined eyes fluttered away before she answered. &#34;She wasn&#39;t feeling well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flexing my fingers, my knuckles cracked. It sounded like an excuse and a pretty lame one at that but it didn&#39;t surprise me. Cassie had never really been the doting wife. I mean what kind of loving wife couldn&#39;t even be bothered to meet her husband after a car crash that had almost killed him. I&#39;d got off pretty lucky and my wolf had already mostly healed me but it could have been worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the others it had been worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both would be in the hospital for at least a few days to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She really shouldn&#39;t have been driving around after what happened yesterday. That kind of trauma.&#34; She shook her old head. &#34;I think she was just in shock until she came back from seeing you at the hospital.&#34; Cathy met my eyes, something she rarely did. Instantly I felt like I was being chastised. Mainly because that&#39;s exactly what she was doing. Telling me off and making me feel guilty for thinking about myself when I should have given Cassie a thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was so pale and drawn and I have to be honest she felt-&#34; a small pause. &#34;Off. I really think she might be ill. Of course.&#34; Another glance in my direction. &#34;You announcing you are bringing guests to come and stay is a little-  well it&#39;s bad timing don&#39;t you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did think but I was stuck between a rock and hard place. I owed Megan more than I could ever repay because if it hadn&#39;t been for me she wouldn&#39;t have lost the baby but I realised that my cruelty to Cassie was unfounded at the same time. It wasn&#39;t even that I meant to make her life a misery. It just kind of happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Cassie has gone to bed. I think she needs to sleep and regain her strength. To deal with your guest.&#34; She gave me a pointed look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t start Cathy.&#34; I murmured. Her look spoke volumes. She knew and was trying to make me feel guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I already felt guilty enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t say a word, your highness. Will you want your dinner in the dining room or -?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She may as well have given me the I&#39;m not angry I&#39;m just disappointed speech. &#34;Neither but thank you for making it. I think I am just going to check on Cassie and get some sleep myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearily I trudged up the hairs. Moving as quietly as I could towards my room. I wanted to watch her sleep for a while. Weird as it was when I had just invited my &#34;mistress&#34; to live with us but sometimes watching Cassie gave me peace. When she was asleep anyway. When she was awake she got on my last nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My room was empty. The bedspread pulled tight and increased. There was no Cassie shaped lump under those blankets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused I glanced around. If she wasn&#39;t here in my bed then where would she be? I had seen the panic in her face last night in her own room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Retracing my steps I opened her door as quietly as I could and peered inside and there she was. Curled up in a small ball with her back to me. Her body was shaking, whole body tremors that had nothing to do with the cold and everything to do with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was afraid but she had forced herself to sleep in this room anyway and those fears were so strong that they invaded her sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt ripped through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So did Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like I was being torn in two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight I would do what I could to help my wife because I knew going forward her life would not be easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For either of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping into the room I closed the door softly behind me and started to strip down to my boxers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slipping under the heavy comforter I curled my body around hers. Keeping my arms loose so she wouldn&#39;t freak out and closed my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly all the stress left my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like this was exactly where I needed to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding my wife as she slept soothed my soul to its core. And it made me happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her, feeling her body pressed against mine made me so unbelievably happy that it was hard to comprehend what I was feeling because I had never felt this kind of contentment before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my arms Cassie&#39;s body stopped shaking, a deep sigh escaped her lips as she relaxed in her sleep and my arms tightened around her even more. I pulled her body more snugly into mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a second where I just held her and then Cassie twisted in my arms. Curling her body over mine so I could feel her breasts pushing against my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it was even better than before because now she was holding on to me like a life raft and I kind of needed that right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sssh it&#39;s ok.&#34; I smoothed my hand down her hair as she groggily came awake and stared up at me with sleepy eyes. The look on her face was the sweetest I had ever seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian?&#34;</p>
