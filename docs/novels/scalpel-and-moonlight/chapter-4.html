                <p>White hot pain splintered through my head. It wasn&#39;t dull like any headache I had ever had before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning forward, my elbows on the desk I fought back the urge to groan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shouldn&#39;t feel like this. Even after everything that had happened yesterday, my wolf should have been healing me but honestly, I felt worse than I had when it happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, maybe I had been so preoccupied by what had happened in the hospital after the attack that I hadn&#39;t really given myself a chance to feel lousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another groan escaped my lips and this time I didn&#39;t even bother to try and stifle it. This wasn&#39;t a groan of pain though, it was a sound of frustration and memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman had saved me. The sweet smelling she wolf who had given me her body so passionately. I had never felt anything like it. For those passion filled moments, when her body was under mine and she had abandoned herself to me I had felt a connection like I had never felt before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone rapped their knuckles on the wide wooden door of the office and I shook the memory away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t keep thinking about her when I had so much else to concentrate on. Plus it wasn&#39;t like I would ever find her again. All I knew was that she was a wolf and that she was working at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man who stepped through the door was only a little older than me. I let out a sigh of relief at seeing him. My beta Ian was sometimes the only person I felt I could trust. The only one who understood me and what I was going through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha.&#34; He ducked his head in a small bow and then without asking permission fell into the chair opposite me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beta.&#34; I rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued to stare at me. &#34;You look like shit Julian.&#34; He finally said with a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing back my head I laughed. &#34;I feel worse I can assure you. What did you find out?&#34; Suddenly serious,  I stared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the only one I could trust with everything that had happened yesterday. Including what had happened with the little she wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied me for a second. &#34;There&#39;s only two wolves on the hospital staff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two?&#34; I blinked at him in shock. I had presumed there would be more. Two was great news because one of those women was my mystery saviour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Ian continued to study me. &#34;And only one was on shift when you were there. I&#39;ve had someone go and collect her for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; I settled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But- &#34; Ian&#39;s gaze darted away. &#34;Forgive me Julian but what do you expect to happen here? You got married yesterday. You have a mate now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t remind me.&#34; I shook my head. &#34;I don&#39;t even know this woman and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you talking about your wife or your mystery woman?&#34; Ian asked sweetly and I couldn&#39;t help it. I burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a point there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell am I going to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no idea Julian but I suggest maybe put women to the back of your mind for now and concentrate on more important things.&#34; He winked. &#34;Someone tried to kill you yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah well,&#34; I shrugged. &#34;Someone is always trying to kill me these days..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both laughed even though it was no laughing matter. It was the truth though. Someone was always trying to murder me. The attempts on my life had been happening since I was a child but last night had been close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me again what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned. &#34;Do you really need to hear it again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Ian said sternly. And it instantly reminded me of why he was my Beta. He was my friend, yes but he was also great at being my second. A fierce fighter and a clever strategist. He would have made a good alpha in his own right but Ian had never wanted to lead.  &#34;You can leave out the sex this time though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing, I leant back. &#34;The elders were driving me insane.&#34; I shook my head. That was an understatement. &#34;After the - disagreement about me going to the church.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips twitched upwards as he forced himself not to smile. Another understatement. It hadn&#39;t been a disagreement, it had been a full blown screaming match which had resulted in me storming out before I hurt someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You left, yeah I remember and you went.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To a bar.&#34; I reminded him. &#34;I can&#39;t remember which one but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He threw up a hand silencing me. &#34;You don&#39;t know which one but somehow your enemies found you and poisoned you?&#34; His voice was sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know if I was poisoned but it was like I couldn&#39;t see straight and it&#39;s not like we can get drunk-&#34; I laughed but there was no mirth in it. &#34;And then,&#34; screwing up my eyes, my hands went to my head as fresh pain ripped through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said before that it felt like you were going to pass out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mutely I nodded. &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was exactly how it had felt. Like my vision was swimming and reality had morphed into a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A poison made especially for you then.&#34; Ian nodded. &#34;I&#39;m guessing they didn&#39;t get the dose right and your wolf saved you. He&#39;s a powerful beast after all. What&#39;s worrying me is that they seem to be able to find you no matter where you go. Are you sure you didn&#39;t recognise them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. Did Ian think I had a traitor in my midst? That wasn&#39;t something I wanted to think about. &#34;I don&#39;t think so. Rogues I believe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rogues? Maybe but how would rogues be able to find you so easily? How- I&#39;ll check the cameras around the hospital.&#34; He mumbled to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no cameras in the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian didn&#39;t answer but the look he gave me was enough to answer enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They were tampered with?&#34; I asked, my head falling into my hands. It was strange but I felt weird.  Not out of it like I had yesterday but suddenly weak. Even to my own fingers, I felt feverish. Which was impossible because as the heir to the throne, I was one of the strongest wolves in the country. I didn&#39;t get sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course but I&#39;m going to check the neighbourhood and-&#34; he paused, his eyes narrowing. &#34;You really don&#39;t look great Julian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to tell him that I didn&#39;t feel great either but at that moment the door knocked again. It opened and a woman stepped through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was vaguely familiar. I had seen her before. Half rising out of my seat, I tried to catch her scent but her perfume was too strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is your name?&#34; My hands curled around the desk to stop me from swaying. Standing up was a bad idea but I couldn&#39;t show any weakness. Not in front of anyone&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan, your Highness.&#34; The pretty woman dropped her chin into her chest. Her eyes lowered to the carpet and didn&#39;t move from that spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were working at the hospital yesterday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; She mumbled. &#34;Alpha.&#34; She added quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened, forcing my spine straight. &#34;Then you are the wolf that saved me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slowly lifted her head, her eyes finding mine and widening. Hesitating, she paused and then a smile spread across her face. &#34;Yes, I&#39;m the one who saved you.&#34;</p>
