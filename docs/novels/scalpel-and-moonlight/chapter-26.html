                <p>Sitting in the back of the sleek black town car I leant my head on the cool window and closed my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight had been just another disaster but at least now I knew what I had suspected all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian had been in love with Megan. That&#39;s why he had given her what was meant to be mine. Why he seemed to favour her above all others. It shouldn&#39;t hurt but it did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made my chest ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had seen the hurt on his face when he had overheard her with Ryder. The pain and misery in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It should have made me feel happy that he was in pain but it didn&#39;t. No one should ever have to find out that the person they loved was cheating on them like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And whether they were in love or just fucking didn&#39;t really matter. Megan had played him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a way it kind of reminded me of my mother&#39;s situation. My mum loved my dad even now after everything he had done to her , she still doted on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never wanted to be in that situation. So reliant on other people for my happiness. So locked in a relationship that was toxic that I couldn&#39;t see a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But wasn&#39;t that exactly the kind of relationship I was in? I was trapped in a love less marriage with a man who had just had his heart broken by another woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian would never love me. He had said so himself. If I didn&#39;t divorce him then he would make my life hell. Those had been his very words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I believed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which meant I couldn&#39;t stay married to him. I had to get myself out of the contract the king had made me sign and that would take money. A lot of money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus my mother would need more hospital care going forward. And that wasn&#39;t going to be cheap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even have a job anymore. How the hell was I meant to pay for my freedom without a job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Cassie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes flew open to find the driver staring at me in the rear view mirror. His eyes worried. &#34;Are you ok?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Absently i brushed away the tears on my cheek. I wasn&#39;t even upset. I was silently crying because I was angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angry at Julian, angry at myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angry at my dad for putting me in this situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerking upright I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the answer to all of this because he was the one who controlled my mothers money. He had no money of his own only hers and he had taken control when she became sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of that money was mine. Promised to me in my grandfathers will on the day of my marriage. Well I was married now and I needed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be enough to get me out of the Kings contract, with enough left over to maybe buy a small home for me and mum and start a small clinic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We could be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just needed to get my hands on the money that was owed to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning forward I tapped the driver on the shoulder. &#34;Could you take me to my fathers house please.&#34; I glanced around the area and frowned. &#34;It&#39;s actually not far from here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, miss. I&#39;ll take you wherever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly gave him the address and settled back down against the buttery leather of the seats. It was hard to relax but I managed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daddy couldn&#39;t argue with me about the money. It was mine by law and it would make all my problems go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would be free of Julian once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My happy mood evaporated the moment the car pulled on to my dads drive. There was a new car packed outside his door. A flashy red sports thing that I knew he shouldn&#39;t be able to afford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you wait here for me please.&#34; Without waiting for an answer I climbed out the car and hobbled up the path towards the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked once and waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then I waited some more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew someone was in because the lights were on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting my hand I went to knock again and the door finally opened. Illuminating my fathers mistress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you forget something baby or can&#39;t you stay away from me for five minutes.&#34; She cooed. &#34;Oh Cassie. It&#39;s you. I thought you were your daddy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curled my lip in disgust. &#34;I gathered that and gross, don&#39;t say the word daddy again in my presence. Can I come in or are you going out?&#34; I took in the short dress that barely skimmed her thighs and the heavy fur coat draped over her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just yucky. Tacky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no.&#34; She stepped back with a flourish. &#34;Please come in. But take your shoes off. I&#39;ve just had the carpets shampooed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t need to if you had left the beautiful hardwood flooring my mom put down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was ludicrous that she was inviting me into the house my mother actually owned. This was my childhood home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well we are renovating some rooms to get things ready for-&#34; her hand lovingly went to her stomach and my eyes bulged out of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bump was small but it was still a bump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re pregnant?&#34; I couldn&#39;t help the wobble in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She beamed at me. Totally oblivious to my scowl. Either she didn&#39;t care that I hated her or she was to stupid to notice I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m about six months gone. That&#39;s why we were out this evening.&#34; She answered a question I hadn&#39;t asked. &#34;Celebrating our happy news. We are having a boy. You&#39;re going to have a better Cassie.&#34; She hugged me awkwardly and I didn&#39;t know what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well this is a nice surprise. I didn&#39;t expect to see you tonight Cassie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello dad.&#34; I forced myself to smile. I was always forcing myself. I didn&#39;t even remember how to smile because I was happy. &#34;Annie.&#34; I felt sick even saying that homewreckers  name &#34;Was just telling me your happy news and showing me the home improvements you are making.&#34; Sarcasm dripped from my voice and he picked up on it straight away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed. &#34;Here is four ice cream Annie my love. Why don&#39;t you take it up to bed. I&#39;m just going to chat to Cassie a moment.&#34; Grabbing my arm he dragged me towards the sitting room. Almost throwing me towards a chair. &#34;What do you want, Cassie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood there. Hands on my hips and scowled straight back at him. &#34;How much of mothers money are you spending on that whore?&#34; Never before in my life had I called another woman that word but when it came to Annie I forgot myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His slap took me by surprise. &#34;Don&#39;t ever call her that ever again. She is the mother of my child. Of my son. I won&#39;t ever have her disrespected.&#34; He scowled down at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hand pressed to my burning cheek I straightened slowly. &#34;How much money?&#34; I repeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my money as well. Money your mum owes me. Our marriage contract said she had to produce a child and she failed. She&#39;s an old barren witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hurt but they shouldn&#39;t have. He had said similar things before. It always seemed to slip his mind that I was his child as well. Being a girl didn&#39;t seem to count to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a disgusting human.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, Cassie. Tell me and get out.&#34; He repeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The money I was promised if I married. I need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed right in my face. His cheeks turning red. &#34;Why do you need money Cassie. You&#39;re married to the future king. It would be me asking you for a loan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not a loan.&#34; I said between gritted teeth. &#34;It&#39;s my inheritance. So write the Cheque or do the transfer and I&#39;ll never darken your door again. You can go back to living your lie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; He shook his head. &#34;I&#39;ll write you a cheque.&#34; Walking over to a sideboard he yanked open a drawer.  For a second there was silence as he signed the piece of paper that would mean my freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There.&#34; He pushed the folded piece of paper into my hand. &#34;I suggest you spend it on yourself. Your hair and make up.&#34; He motioned to my cheek which was still burning from his earlier slap. &#34;You are beginning to look as haggard as your mother. Maybe invest in some clothes that will keep your husband interested in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crumbled the cheque in my hand. &#34;Thank you father. I hope this is the right amount?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all you&#39;re getting from me Cassie. Now leave and don&#39;t come back. You are no longer welcome in my home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears stung my eyes but they didn&#39;t fall. Keeping my back straight and my head high I walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t be back.&#34; I muttered as a slipped back into the back of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I wouldn&#39;t be. The cheque in my hand meant freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freedom from my father and freedom from Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the men who were trying to control and use me.</p>
