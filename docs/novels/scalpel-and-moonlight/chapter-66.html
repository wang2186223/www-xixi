                <p>Outside of the room Forrest froze with his hand outstretched. It hovered in the air above the door handle as he turned his head and stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t look away although I wanted to. Because he had heard my husbands words as clear as I had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ice ran through my veins. I didn&#39;t know the context in which he would &#34;take care of me&#34; but it sounded awfully like a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly my need to make sure my husband was alright after his accident was gone. I didn&#39;t want to be here anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian was fine. He was with the woman he had chosen. She was the one he wanted to be with and I had to accept that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did accept that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t like I was in love with him. Hell I didn&#39;t even like him and now I knew better than ever that I couldn&#39;t stay with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t even be able to stay in town or anywhere close by. I needed to find somewhere and grab my mother and go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because- my eyes swept towards the door again and then quickly darted away. If I stayed I was pretty sure I would be the victim of an unfortunate accident. If Julian didn&#39;t do it then Megan would. She had already tried to kill my babies so I wouldn&#39;t put anything passed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twisting on my heel I walked away without saying a word. Leaving Forrest, his doctor friend and the nurse staring at my retreating back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ca-&#34; Forrest called after me. &#34;Excuse me she&#39;s not been feeling very well.&#34; He made an excuse for me and even as I pushed my way out of the corridor and into a much busier one I could hear his footsteps rushing after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sped up. I didn&#39;t want to talk to anyone least of all him. I couldn&#39;t bear to see the sympathy in his eyes. I had rushed here because I cared about Julian and here he was plotting my death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forrest caught hold of my bicep , spinning me around. I went without any fuss. Stumbling into his chest and hiding my face in his sweet smelling wool sweater. For a second I thought about ripping myself from his arms but it was just a fleeting thought before I sagged against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly his arms tightened around me. I wanted to lose myself in the protection of his arms but I knew I couldn&#39;t do that. There were too many people here who could report back to Julian and even if things between Forrest and I was innocent I knew how it could be misconstrued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; I mumbled. Even though that was a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you&#39;re not.&#34; Forrest&#39;s hands smoothed a circle on my back and it did help. &#34;You need a hug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I detangled myself from his arms. Stepping away. &#34;We can&#39;t do that here Forrest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion pinched his eyebrows together. &#34;So you&#39;re not allowed to hug a friend now.&#34; The first hint of anger was making his voice deeper. There was a low growl in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know how he would see it if he found out we had embraced in public.&#34; I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t care about you Cassie.&#34; The words ripped there way out of his throat with another growl. &#34;I don&#39;t understand why you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him. &#34;I don&#39;t care about Julian.&#34; I lied. &#34;But I care about you and he will come after you. I don&#39;t want that.&#34; Lifting my eyes I tried to send him a message without even saying a word and failed. Shaking my head I reached for his hand and wrapped my fingers around it. &#34;I never want you to get hurt Forrest.&#34; I said truthfully.  &#34;And he will hurt you if he sees us hugging.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forrest&#39;s green eyes narrowed. &#34;It&#39;s not me I&#39;m worried about Cassie.&#34; He said in a hushed voice. &#34;It&#39;s you. I really think he&#39;s going to try and hurt you and if he doesn&#39;t-&#34; He fell silent as someone walked passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They looked puzzled but they also looked curious. This corridor was too public for this conversation. Grabbing Forrest&#39;s arm I pulled him through another door and into an empty room. The bed was stripped down and the whole place stank of death. Someone had died in here and recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrinkled my nose up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was kind of fitting though because we were about to have a serious talk about my husband and his mistress trying to murder me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan will.&#34; I finished Forrest&#39;s earlier sentence. &#34;I know that because she&#39;s already tried. And after hearing-&#34; I motioned towards the door.  Like Julian&#39;s room was right outside of it and not several corridors away.  &#34;She&#39;s going to try and kill my babies at the very least.&#34; Moving away from Forrest I jumped up on the bed and let my feet swing for a second. &#34;And that&#39;s the reason I need to get my mum and leave. But-&#34; back and forth my legs swung but for a second I couldn&#39;t say the words I needed to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had come to Forrest for help. But I knew now that I couldn&#39;t ask that of him. Julian and Megan would know who had helped me. They would come after him to get to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My friendship might cost him his life and I couldn&#39;t have that on my conscience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to do it alone.&#34; Jumping up I took a step towards the door. &#34;I&#39;ll wait in the car whilst you deal with your patients. I think it&#39;s best that he doesn&#39;t know I am here or what I might have heard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forrest stepped into my path. Blocking the door. &#34;No.&#34; He said firmly. &#34;You are going to go and visit with Julian because people have seen you here and it&#39;s the right thing to do.&#34; He took a deep shaky breath. &#34;And when we leave I am going to help you escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I began to shake my head , opening my mouth to tell him no and his hand came over it to silence me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No arguments, Cassie. I am helping you escape him.&#34;</p>
