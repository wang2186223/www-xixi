                <p>Just use your magic. That&#39;s what Ian had said like it was the most natural thing in the world. When in reality it wasn&#39;t. I hadn&#39;t been able to spark the magic that healed for more than a few seconds in the entire time I had been away and even before then, when it had sparked out of my fingertips I hadn&#39;t meant to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell I hadn&#39;t even known what I was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The panther healer had tried to teach me but it hadn&#39;t been working. I couldn&#39;t get control of it. My fingers speakers and burned leaving them blackened with soot but there was none of that comforting warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I had no idea what Ian expected me to do. If the Kings doctors couldn&#39;t help him what the hell was I meant to do? And then of course there was the fact i might accidentally kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet paused , and without meaning to I glanced to my right. Julian&#39;s childhood bedroom was right there. Less that a foot away. I&#39;d only been in there once and it hadn&#39;t gone well. Without thinking about it I reached out and brushed my fingers against the wood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth spread up my fingers and spiralled up my arm making it ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie?&#34; A few steps in front of me Ian paused and turned. His eyebrows slammed together as he stared at me. &#34;Is everything ok?&#34; His eyes travelled down my body and his frown deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Dropping my hand to my side I walked ahead. &#34;Why wouldn&#39;t it be. I just don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to be able to help.&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several seconds passed and we walked along in silence. No guards stepped out of shadows and challenged us. It was like the whole palace was asleep. Even Cathy seemed to have disappeared. Ian had more friends here then he let on. And I was glad about that. It didn&#39;t stop me being worried though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This whole situation was just- odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ian?&#34; I couldn&#39;t help the trembling to my voice as he stopped and pushed open one of two wide double doors and stepped through. I hesitated before following agter him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; His voice was tired. &#34;Will you get in here before you are seen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m a doctor not a magic user.&#34; I snapped back. &#34;The king already has doctors. The best doctors.&#34; Shuffling my feet I walked in after him. My eyes found the bed straight away and the blood drained from my face and made me dizzy as I stared at the greyish face of the king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes his heart still beat but the body around it was already dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing I can do here Ian. Even the best doctors in the world can&#39;t help him now and I&#39;ve never been the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always do that.&#34; He snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what?&#34; The old king even smelt like he was already dead. I pressed my hand under my nose to try and stifle the stench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Put yourself down. You are more than a doctor Cassie. You are a healer. And you promised to try.&#34; He lowered his voice. &#34;Try and use your magic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t harness it and -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed my wrist and yanked my hand up. &#34;Then why is your arm glowing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at it open mouthed. What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It began the second you touched Julian&#39;s door. I think being close to something of your mates helped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to argue back but I couldn&#39;t. The time of pretending Julian wasn&#39;t fated to be in my life was long over. It didn&#39;t mean I had to bend over and take what he dished out though. Those days were over as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trembling I shook Ian free and tiptoed over to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re highness.&#34; I whispered. There was no answer. He just lay there like a corpse who had forgotten to stop breathing. Reaching down I touched his forehead and it was clammy and cold. It felt almost slimy under my fingers and I had to fight back the urge to yank my hand away. The old man&#39;s breathing caught in his throat and stuck there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie-&#34; Ian panicked behind me. And the king&#39;s breath rattled out again. He went back to breathing normally and I let out a sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know.&#34; Falling to my knees.i pressed my hand to his forehead and closed my eyes. Concentrating on, I had no clue what. That was a close one. Too close for comfort actually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is anything happening?&#34; Ian hissed. &#34;Cassie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to drown out his words but it was impossible. &#34;I can&#39;t concentrate with you breathing down my neck Ian. Back the fuck up-&#34; I froze. My head cocked to the side as the faint sound of a car pulling up to the drive hit my eats. Ian heard it as well. I could tell by the way his spine snapped straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; I whispered climbing to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trouble.&#34;  He reached out a hand. &#34;We need to find somewhere to hide and quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Torn I looked between the dying man on the bed and my protector. &#34; but the king?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do anything for him dead Cassie. We will try again when it&#39;s dark and they have gone.&#34; Gripping my hand he tugged me from the room and down the same corridor but in the opposite direction to what we had come. Ian knew this palace scarily well and I had to trust him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to find somewhere you can hide and-&#34; he paused. His whole body tensing as he looked behind me and then as quick as a snake he took a defensive position in front of me and faced back down towards the kings chambers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck.&#34; He swore and at first I didn&#39;t know what was causing him such distress. I didn&#39;t understand it until the smallest breeze blew into my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I smelt it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian was here.</p>
