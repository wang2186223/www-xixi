                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed a job. It was the only thing that got me out of my nice warm bed the next day. It wasn&#39;t even about the money. Although now I had been pretty much cut off having a wage coming in wouldn&#39;t hurt. It was more about having something to do. Keeping busy was the only thing that would stop me going crazy.  And being married to Julian I was definitely going crazy. It was the only explanation about what had happened between us last might.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have been mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or bewitched. Because no one in their right mind would have allowed last night to happen, I could still feel the scrapes on my back where mh skin had rubbed away on the hard bark of the tree and there was a deliciously wicked ache between my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook the thought away. Wrapping my scarf more firmly around my throat and bringing it up over my chin. The morning air was chilly and the weather was turning grey. Which suited me just fine. My entire life was shades of grey now , Grey with misery and I wanted the rest of the world to feel the same. Like they were without hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made my spine snap straight and my high heeled boots paused on the pavement. I wasn&#39;t without hope. No one ever was. I just needed something to do. A job to throw myself into. It didn&#39;t have to be medicine it could be anything-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like magic my eyes were drawn to a notice in a window. A simple hand written sign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile spread across my face under the heavy knitted scarf. It had to be a sign. The universe was telling me something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing my way into the building I was faced with a steep flight of stares. Sighing I moved up them following the low melody of music that was drifting down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half way up I woman appeared at the top. I didn&#39;t know her but I recognized her for what she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stared at each other. &#34;Can I help you?&#34; She broke the silence first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi I was just inquiring about the job.&#34; I smiled sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Her face broke into a wide smile. &#34;Sure come on up. I have a class starting in a few minutes. Maybe you can help out? Do you have much experience in teaching children?&#34; She was talking a million miles an hour. Her smile was open and friendly and I instantly felt at ease.  &#34;What dance do you know. We are ideally looking for someone in all disciplines.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, just for a second but she caught on to it straight away. &#34;You are a dance teacher right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a choice to make I could lie to her or I could be honest. It was a no brainer. &#34;No, I&#39;m a doctor. My name is Cassie-&#34; I didn&#39;t give her my family name. Hell I didn&#39;t even know what family name i was meant to use these days. My own or Julian&#39;s? It wasn&#39;t like we were exactly telling everyone of our marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face fell. &#34;We are looking for a teacher. A dancer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I took lessons as a kid. And I&#39;m a quick learner.&#34; This was a whole new low for me. I was a high trained and skilled doctor and here I was begging for a job teaching children to dance. I didn&#39;t care though. I wanted this job. It would give me the opportunity to give back to the community.  And that&#39;s all I had ever wanted to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; She turned to me. Studying my face and at first I thought she was going to send me on my way. &#34;Fine let&#39;s give you a go. You can help out today and we will see if you can be of any use to me. What size shoe do you wear?&#34; Studying me she smiled. &#34;I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t have you own stuff with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll buy some.&#34; I mumbled quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We will cross that bridge if I give you a job.&#34; She held out a hand. &#34;I&#39;m Scarlette by the way. I hope you&#39;re ready to work hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I loved every minute of the class. From trying to teach the children simple moves that even I felt I got wrong to having my ears filled with their laughter. It was the most pleasant hour I had spent in weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what I loved most was watching Scarlette dance. She was so naturally graceful. Like an angel moving across the floor. It was almost a shame that she was stuck teaching kiddie classes because she belonged on the stage in front of thousands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would pay to watch her and so would Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. What was wrong with me thinking about him at a time like this? It wasn&#39;t like we were a real couple. We wouldn&#39;t be going on any dates where we could watch graceful dancers pirouettes across the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t want to go with him even if he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you think?&#34; Having closed the door behind the last parent and child she fell cross legged on to the floor next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so talented.&#34; I said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So are you.&#34; She nodded her head in a small bow. &#34;I was pleasantly surprised. I think you would fit in perfectly here but it&#39;s only part time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart leapt. She was offering me a job. &#34;Part time is fine. Thank you.&#34; I leant in to hug her. She would never know how much this meant to me. She had given me a chance and I would never forget it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; She hugged me quickly before scooting backwards. &#34;Are you really a doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But now you want to be a dance teacher?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My smile faded. I couldn&#39;t explain my situation to her or anyone. It was so complicated that sometimes I didn&#39;t even understand it. &#34;It&#39;s a long story but I&#39;m not practising at the moment and anyway-&#34; I spread my arms out from my sides. &#34;This was always one of my dreams as well. I used to love dance class.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scarlettes eyes sparkled with delight. &#34;Mine too.&#34; She bit her lip and the happiness evaporated from her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Reaching for her I took her hand. Squeezing my fingers around hers. It was clear that she had something on her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I ask a favour?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course you can ask me anything.&#34; I would grant her any favoyr she wanted. Because she had given me a chance and I now had a job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My pack was attacked and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach twisted. &#34;You don&#39;t have a pack doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was killed in the fray. Some of the men are badly injured-&#34; she trailed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was already on my feet. &#34;I have my bag in my car. You just lead the way.&#34;</p>
