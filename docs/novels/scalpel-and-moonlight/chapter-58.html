                <p>Cathy was there when I opened my eyes the next morning. It was almost like she had been hovering in the door waiting for me to open my eyes she was so quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning miss, how are you feelin?&#34; She asked as she bustled in with a loaded tray in her hands. She laid the tray on my legs and started pouring tea into a china cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled my thanks as she hovered over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Cassie?&#34; She prompted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly took stock of my body. She hadn&#39;t given me a chance before. Surprisingly I felt good. A little aching in places but my mind was relatively clear and unburdened by dark thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; I smiled and the moment I did I saw the relief flood her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am so glad Cassie. You had us all so worried. I&#39;ve never seen the young  prince like that before. The panic and fear in his face,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the rim of the pale blue china tea cup I blinked at her. &#34;You haven&#39;t? What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When he carried you in here.&#34; Cathy busied herself tidying the room. &#34;I&#39;ve never seen him look so fierce or so tender.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help myself. I smiled. That was Julian all over. He was all opposites all the time. &#34;Where is he?&#34; I had woken up alone but that didn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t downstairs somewhere or even in the shower although I couldn&#39;t hear any water running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He left a few hours ago.&#34; Cathy said in a sing song voice as she drew back the heavy drapes and flooded the room with blinding light. The heavy rain of yesterday seemed to have blown passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ok.&#34; I couldn&#39;t help the deflated feeling in my chest but Cathy didn&#39;t seem to notice it. She hummed her way around the room straightening things as she went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After last night I had hoped he would be here with me when I woke up but some things never did change. Last night was a fluke and I had to remember it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But of course it had to be a one time thing. My hands settled on the blankets right over my stomach. I was carrying another man&#39;s child. There could be no happily forever after for me and Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should get up and prepare for work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian has taken care of that. You don&#39;t need to go back until you feel ready. He&#39;s good to you, and he&#39;s assigned a driver for you as well. A very capable young man. Devan will keep you safe and sound when our young prince isn&#39;t with you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our young prince? It was sweet she thought Julian was mine but he wasn&#39;t and he never would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want to do with your day off? Any plans?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a sip of my tea. Savouring the taste of it. I knew exactly what I was going to do with my day off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am going to see my mum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Cassie.&#34; My mum&#39;s nurse met me in the hallway like she had been expecting me. Her face was drawn. &#34;Did you get my message?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming to a stop I shook my head. &#34;No what message?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I left you an answer phone message yesterday.&#34; She smiled as mine slipped off my face. After everything that had happened I hadn&#39;t even thought to pick up my messages. My mum could have needed me and I had been thinking of nothing but myself. &#34;Is she ok?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh she&#39;s fine. A royal pain in my bum sometimes,&#34; the nurse gave the smallest giggle and I couldn&#39;t help but chuckle right along with her. &#34;She wants to discharged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she well enough for that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. The doctor will have certain stipulations because she will need to come back often to be checked but she&#39;s healing very very well. And I think a home setting with her family around her will do her the world of good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank. I wanted all of that for my mother and for myself as well. But I couldn&#39;t bring her to live with me and Julian because sooner rather than later he would find out about my pregnancy and I would have to run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t leave her at his mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go and tell her the good news.&#34; Waving to her I made my way further into the ward and towards my mothers room. I would work something out. I had money. I could rent her a small apartment and move in with her to look after her. Already ideas and plans were forming in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just sign the damn papers.&#34; The shrill woman&#39;s voice was coming from my mothers room and I stopped in my tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Annie, my fathers mistress doing here? Creeping forward I listened in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t divorce him.&#34; My mother&#39;s voice was weak. Like she was so tired she could cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to divorce him. My son will be born soon. Joshua will need to have shares in the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head snapped up. Shares in the company? Hadn&#39;t dad said the money was all gone?  That was why there was none of my inheritance left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The company is half mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that&#39;s why you need to demand a divorce from him. You haven&#39;t done anything to help the business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mothers sigh was loud. &#34;Cassie told me that Marvin was struggling for money. That&#39;s the reason her marriage to the prince was pushed forward. The family needed the funds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annie&#39;s laugh was condescending. &#34;Oh don&#39;t be stupid. The money isn&#39;t gone and the business isn&#39;t failing. Marvin just needs Cassie with the prince to help us get in with the royal family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At my side my fists clenched. Was that what all of this was about? Was my own father using me to get a better standing in the court. Was he using me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But of course he was. That was just the kind of man my father was. He&#39;d always been the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning forward I peeked in to the room in time to see Annie lean threateningly over my mums body. &#34;Do you know what kind of man your only daughter is married to? Do you know how cruel he is? And she can&#39;t leave because you won&#39;t divorce her father. She&#39;s staying because of you. You-&#34; she stabbed a sharply pointed nail into my mother&#39;s chest. Not far above her wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is enough.&#34; Angrily I stepped into the room. My hands on my hips. &#34;It&#39;s time for you to leave Annie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere until I&#39;ve said my piece Cassie.&#34; She rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will drag you out of this room and this hospital by your badly put in hair extensions if you don&#39;t leave right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of fear entered her eyes but she quickly hid it. Sweeping her hair over her shoulder she preened almost like she expected me to be swayed by her looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t a man who would fall for such things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out. I won&#39;t have you upsetting my mum and jeopardising her health.&#34; I pointed to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t tell me what to do,Cassie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When your father hears of this he will-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head she was like a spoiled brat. &#34;He will do what? Take it up with my husband? The Prince.&#34; Throwing my head back I laughed, &#34;Leave Annie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as she flounced out of the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a bitch.&#34; Turning back to my mum I reached for her hand. &#34;Are you ok? She didn&#39;t hurt you, did she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Julian really mistreating you?&#34; My mum asked in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perching on the edge of her bed I squeezed her hand. &#34;No he&#39;s not mistreating me mum. You shouldn&#39;t listen to Annie. She is just jealous because she will always be the mistress. She knows she has no control over anything in that position. She&#39;s his doll, his plaything.&#34; My smile slipped a little. &#34;His brood mare. He&#39;s always wanted a son and she will give him one but at the end of the day he will always be yours. Because deep down he loves you and you love him&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t love him though Cassie.&#34; Resigned my mum sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at her in shock. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a contract. That was all. Just like the one you are in. And I was miserable. The only good thing in my life was you. I don&#39;t want you to suffer the same fate as me. Trapped in a loveless marriage. I want more for you than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted more for me and my children as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up I had thought my mum had loved my dad and that&#39;s why she had stuck around but now I could see the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know mum.&#34; Standing up I kissed her cheek. &#34;I know you want to get out of here but can you give me a few more days? I need to find us a place to live and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go and speak to your doctor mum but don&#39;t worry it won&#39;t be much longer and we can really start living our lives again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snagged my wrist. &#34;Thank you Cassie. For everything. This place feels like a prison and I&#39;m going crazy being locked up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming out of my mothers doctors office I walked straight into Megan. Stumbling backwards my ears were full of the sound of her mocking laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was almost like she had been waiting for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Cassie.&#34; She giggled theatrically. Smoothing her tight skirt down her legs. &#34;You should really be more careful. More aware of your surroundings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pursing my lips I stared her up and down. Everything she wore was conservative but left absolutely nothing to the imagination. Ever item showed off her curves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here? You don&#39;t work here anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to deal with Megan. Not after what had happened yesterday and already running into Annie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;neither do you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was visiting my mum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yeah.&#34; She giggled sarcastically. &#34;I guess Julian didn&#39;t factor in that you would come here today? Or maybe he did. Maybe he wanted you to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, I stared at her and then it hit me. &#34;You are here to meet my husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled triumphantly. &#34;He phoned this morning. He really wants to see me so we can discuss the future.&#34; She winked. &#34;Although I doubt we will do much talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt sick. Nausea rolled through my stomach. Was that reason he hadn&#39;t waited around for me to wake up this morning? Was he already rushing to meet his mistress?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It shouldn&#39;t upset me but it did. Not that I would ever let Megan see the pain she was causing me. I wouldn&#39;t give her the satisfaction.  Throwing back my head I laughed. &#34;Oh please Megan.&#34; I laughed until tears ran down my cheeks smudging my makeup. &#34;You don&#39;t have a future with Julian. Women like you.&#34; I raked my eyes up and down her perfect body with scorn because she wasn&#39;t the only one who could be a bitch. &#34;Aren&#39;t wives to men like Julian. You are whores.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you poor fool.&#34; She stepped into my space. So close that it felt like I would choke on her overpowering perfume. &#34;You will see. He&#39;s going to divorce you and marry me&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if to prove her point the roar of a sports cars engine rumbled through the parking lot. Megan&#39;s smile grew wider and wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me Cassie. I have a date with a prince.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t watch her walk away but I did move to the window to look down at the parking lot below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And my heart broke as I watched Megan slide gracefully into Julian&#39;s car and they took off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t been lying. He had come for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit back the urge to sob. They didn&#39;t deserve my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my bag my phone began to ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello.&#34; I answered it without looking who was calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a sigh of relief to hear Forrest&#39;s voice I relaxed. Forrest was my friend. I could count on him to make me feel better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie, you need to leave.&#34; He sounded breathless. &#34;You need to run. Today or tomorrow at the lastest.&#34; Taking a deep breath he shattered my heart with one sentence. &#34;Cassie, Megan is pregnant and Julian is the father.&#34;</p>
