                <p>It was like I could feel the pull of his lips on my nipple in my stomach. Like they were attached with a rope. It pulled on every part of me. Fanning the flames of passion that were already smouldering under my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have made a sound in the back of my throat because he paused his lap of my hard nipple to flick his eyes up to me. Those eyes were trying to tell me something but I just couldn&#39;t understand what they were saying. I couldn&#39;t fathom it. But then again mine were probably speaking in riddles as well. I knew I was begging him. Not just to fill my body completely but to believe me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, my eyes closed as his tongue curled around my other nipple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t need him to believe me , I needed him to believe in me. There was a difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes locked with his as he bit down hard enough to draw my full attention back to him. His were puzzled and mine were wary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed something from him. Something I didn&#39;t even want to say out loud. In a way, and it was perverse way, I needed to go back to a time where we hated each other. Where life was simple. Life had changed so much. It had become full of so much love and confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And overwhelming heartbreak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed him to be cruel for just a few seconds before he loved me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like he could read my mind Julian came off my breast with a wet popping sound. His eyes narrowed into slits as he stared down at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air left my lungs in a loud whoosh. My breath white and steamy as it hit the frigid air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me what you are thinking about?&#34; He growled out but I could tell he knew what I wanted. What I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mutely I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re cold.&#34; His eyes softened. His hands were gentle when they roved up and down my body almost like he was trying to warm me up. That was laughable really because there would be no warming me up when I was laying in sludgy snow. &#34;We should shift and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head again, more violently this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of shock flitted across his face. &#34;No to the cold or no to the going back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; My voice was strong. &#34;I don&#39;t want that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realisation darkened his eyes. It didn&#39;t matter that I hadn&#39;t actually answered him. &#34;I see.&#34; He said thoughtfully. Lifting himself slightly from me, my body shivered at the sudden loss of his warm skin against mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why you run from me.&#34; He said , jumping to his feet he heaved me upwards hard, and with such force that for a second my breasts were crushed almost painfully against his rock hard chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He span me around with shocking ease. My arms trapped behind my back as he bent me into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t because your wolf needed to stretch her legs.&#34; He ground into my ass. &#34;No, it had nothing to do with that. Did it? You ran because you wanted me to chase.&#34; Bending over my back, he bit down on my shoulder. Hard enough that I knew he had left a crescent shape mark in my goosebump riddled skin but not hard enough to break the skin completely. &#34;You wanted me to chase you, stalk you and catch you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over and over again he bit down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moan ripped its way out of my mouth. Breathy and needy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wanted me catch you, claim you.&#34; He slammed forward, the thick head of his cock breaching me in one almost violent thrust that rocked me forward. &#34;Fuck you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My moan turned into a scream of pleasure and pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wrists still trapped in his big hands, he forced my back to arch for him as he surged forward again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what you needed wasn&#39;t it?&#34; He ground out between gritted teeth. I was powerless to answer him but really I didn&#39;t need to because he was my mate and he already knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is why.&#34; He punctuated every word with a savage thrust.  &#34;You shifted naked under the snow for me, isn&#39;t it? Did my little mate need reminding of who she is.&#34; One of Julian&#39;s arms went around me. His fingers playing over my clit in time with his thrusts in and out of my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My back stayed arched. He&#39;d hit the nail on the head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are real, I am real.&#34; His movements became jerky, shallowerer as I began to tremble around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so close. Insanely close but unable to fall into the sweet oblivion that release offered me. I needed to cum. I needed him make me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our love is real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that. I really did. But with everything that had happened recently I just needed reminding. And this was the perfect way. It was brutal and savage, there wasn&#39;t anything sweet and loving about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like old times before we knew we were mates and hated each other but couldn&#39;t keep our hands off each other anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed so desperately to go back to that time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian.&#34; I slammed back into him. Meeting every thrust of his with an abandon that left no space for words and our bodies bathed in hot sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making love to Julian was amazing. But this wasn&#39;t making love, it was a battle. One where even if I lost then I would win because just for a few seconds I wouldn&#39;t feel like I was losing my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Harder.&#34; I groaned. &#34;Make me feel. Please harder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I expected him to do what I asked but instead his thrusts slowed and then stopped altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He whirled me into his arms. Lifting me under the ass so I had to wrap my legs around him or risk falling from his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking back under the snow heavy branch of a tree, he pressed my back against the wide trunk and entered me again. Slowly this time. His eyes never left mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pussy fluttered around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are real Cassie. Me and you. Mates, lovers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s lips found mine. A tender warm kiss that was so unlike the brutal fucking of a second ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll always be here for you. I&#39;ll always keep you grounded. And I&#39;ll never let you go again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head slammed back, knocking painfully against the rough back as we started moving again. Slower this time. Until with a scream that he swallowed down with a kiss I came apart around him. He filled me with his seed at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panting he dropped his forehead to mine. &#34;Me and you are the only people in the world Cassie. Our family. No one else matters. If it helps you deal right now then we are alone in this world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze locked over his shoulder. &#34;It doesn&#39;t help me.&#34; I whispered in his ear. His cock still buried in my dripping, clenching pussy. &#34;Because someone is watching us.&#34;</p>
