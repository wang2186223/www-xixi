                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know when Ian had been the double baby sling but I was glad of it. It wasn&#39;t exactly comfortable but it secured the twins to my body and kept my hands free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of those hands was curled firmly over a long wicked looking dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that?&#34; Walking to the side of me, Julian glanced at my hand. &#34;Duncan&#39;s blade?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a small shrug. &#34;It has his family crest on it plus I can still smell my blood on it.&#34; He answered softly. We were talking in hushed voices because Ian said we had to move quickly and quietly.  He was worried. More worried than I had ever seen him. I could tell in the stiff way his shoulders were set. He vibrated with barely contained violence. Like he was only just holding back some rage. I made me wonder what else he had found out. Not that I would get a chance to ask him until we were somewhere safe and even then he might not tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian was full of secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m surprised you kept it.&#34; Julian&#39;s voice brought me back to myself. Shaking myself I turned my head towards him. &#34;Yeah I kept it.&#34; I said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; It was genuine question but I wasn&#39;t sure I could answer it. Not without him looking at me in a new way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath. Setting my shoulders. &#34;I watched when he beheaded Cathy.&#34; I said softly but my voice carried. &#34;He pretty much skinned her before that. The torture he made her suffer made your time under his knife look like a childish spat. He ripped her apart and then used his wolf to rip her apart.&#34; I sucked in a breath. Forcing myself to calm down.  I couldn&#39;t let myself get angry. It had been so long since I had shifted and let my wolf out and she was desperate for revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would get it as well, just not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to kill him with this knife.&#34; I said finally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By my side Julian reached for my hand. His fingers brushing against the back of it. &#34;You&#39;re a doctor. A healer. Do not be so quick to take someone&#39;s life Cassie. It changes you. And I don&#39;t want you to change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He meant it in the sweetest way but I whirled on him with a low menacing growl. &#34;You don&#39;t know shit about me Julian. I am going to kill your friend. There&#39;s nothing you can say to change my mind. For what he has done,&#34; I vibrated with anger. &#34;I will end his miserable existence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He isn&#39;t my friend.&#34; Julian said through gritted teeth. He was walking unaided but it was costing him. He kept stumbling and was growing slower and slower. We hadn&#39;t even been walking for long and he was slowing us down. Soon Ian would have no choice but to help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goddess I hated thinking of him as a liability but I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was once upon a time.&#34; I said quietly but I knew Ian had heard because his shoulders slumped a little bit. &#34;Fancy telling me what happened between you all that Duncan has held a grudge against you for decades?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian stumbled. &#34;It&#39;s a long story.&#34; Catching himself on the stone wall, he bent double and wheezed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ian?&#34; I called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m coming.&#34; He stopped dead in front of me  and then turned on his heel and came to catch Julian under the shoulders forced him to keep going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He needs to rest.&#34; I hurried after them because Ian was now almost jogging, dragging Julian along with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He can rest when we are somewhere safe.&#34; He groaned as I set my feet further apart and prepared myself to argue. &#34;We don&#39;t have time for this Cassie.&#34; Ian sounded bone weary. &#34;I don&#39;t have time for you. We are coming to the lower levels and I don&#39;t want to waste time there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at him in surprise. Waste time there? That&#39;s what he had said. But why would I want to linger? Julian was here with us. Who else could be there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrowed my eyes at Ian. &#34;Who is down there?&#34; I asked in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed heavily. &#34;We can&#39;t stop Cassie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At my side my fingers curled into fists. &#34;Who. Is . Down. There.&#34; I stressed each word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie- there&#39;s nothing you can do for your dad.&#34; Julian groaned and I tensed. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t even care. He made your life hell. Sold you over and over again. He was never the dad he should have been to you because you weren&#39;t his blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a threatening step towards him. My fists so tight that I knew I had cut into my palm with my fingernails. The pain didn&#39;t register though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The same could be said for you King Julian.&#34; I ground out and he paled even more. How dare he say those things to me. He didn&#39;t have the right after what he had done to me as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He isn&#39;t your real dad Cassie. So think before you go running off and trying to save him.&#34; Ian said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could go to hell as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I always thought he was.&#34; I was seething with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dare they try and- a thought entered my head. One that made frown even more. &#34;You&#39;ve seen him haven&#39;t you?&#34; I levelled my question at Ian. Who had the good graces to look guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. It&#39;s not pretty Cassie. You don&#39;t want to see him like that.&#34; He was trying desperately to stop me going but that only made me want to see the man I had thought was my father more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing I&#39;ve seen since I&#39;ve come here is pretty, Ian. Take me too him.&#34; I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s too late Cassie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s dead?&#34; I asked. And part of me broke. I hated my dad but he was still my dad and I had seen first hand how Duncan killed people who got in his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not dead. But death is close to him.&#34; Julian shook his head. &#34;The stench of it has been growing stronger and stronger by the second. Please don&#39;t risk yourself to try and save him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian is right. Your dad will never leave this dungeon. He will-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian trailed off as I barged past him. Literally shouldering him out of the way. He was my dad, kind of anyway and I was a doctor. If I could help him, then I had to try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I knew what I was smelling it was easy to follow the trail down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t in the same cell as Julian had been. I didn&#39;t have to crawl on my hands and knees. I came to a stop at a grate in the wall. It was dusty but I knew from the outside it would be shiny brash. The smell was stronger here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze and for a second I wanted to grab hold of my children and run away. It was a fleeting thought before I pressed my hands on either side of that ventilation grate and narrowed my eyes to stare through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I saw him I wished I had listened to Ian and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man ahead of me was the only father I had ever known. He had never loved me but I had loved him. I had been desperate for his affection growing up. Part of me still wanted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was slumped in a velvet and gilded wood chair. I couldn&#39;t see any ropes or chains binding him but he wasn&#39;t trying to run away. The front of his white shirt was crusty with blood. A puddle of urine had pooled around his bare feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy.&#34; I mouthed his name. Clapping a hand over my mouth so I didn&#39;t make a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie?&#34; My father groaned softly. Almost like he had heard me. He lifted his head and stared in my direction  and I bit back a scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was my father , but he couldn&#39;t see me. He wouldn&#39;t be able to see anything ever again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing but two gaping black holes were his eyes used to be.</p>
