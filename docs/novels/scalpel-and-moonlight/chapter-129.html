                <p>Ian&#39;s eyes went wide and I knew he had heard what the Lycan had said as well and I knew he had seen me mouth the words but he didn&#39;t say anything, instead he pressed his finger to his lips to silence me and went back to staring through the grate. I followed suit because I needed to know more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie was a Lycan, at least half of one and the daughter of their leader? It didn&#39;t make sense to me. But I knew what I&#39;d heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain ripped through my torso and I let out a hiss. Instantly in the great hall the Lycans eyes found mine through the grate. All of them looked , locked eyes on me and then looked away. They knew I was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What must they think of me? I was the king and I was hiding away in the walls like some rat. Would they think I was a coward? Hell was I a coward? I actually didn&#39;t know anymore. The only thing I knew for sure was that I wanted to find Cassie and the boys and take them far far away from here. To a place they would be safe. That&#39;s all that mattered to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t answer my question Duncan.&#34; The long haired barbarian looking man didn&#39;t look in my direction and again turned his gaze on Duncan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never gave you my name.&#34; Duncan tried to gather his wits about him. &#34;And I don&#39;t know yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In answer the Lycan threw back his head and laughed. A great booming sound that rattled the high windows. It sounded like a hurricane rushing through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know me Duncan, but I know you. I know your father and mother were murderers and traitors and were put down like the dogs they were when they tried to kill the young prince-&#34; thick eyebrows lifted slightly. Giving him a slightly surprised look.  &#34;But then you know that, don&#39;t you?&#34; His lip curled as he studied the much smaller man. &#34;The apple does not fall far from the tree, does it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the weight of the bigger man&#39;s gaze Duncan bristled. &#34;I was julian&#39;s friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More laughter filled the halls and it wasn&#39;t just from the Lycans. &#34;Was. You WAS his friend. But now?&#34; He shook his shaggy head. &#34;Now you are a traitor. Sitting on his throne. Keeping his mate , my daughter a prisoner.  That is not the act of a friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re wrong.&#34; Duncan said quickly and even from my hiding spot I could almost see his brain trying to work out a story that would fool a king. &#34;I took out the traitor king. I killed him and I have been looking for Julian and Cassie ever since but you are right.&#34; His eyes sparkled. &#34;I do have his mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; The Lycan roared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His mate isn&#39;t your daughter , his mate is a lovely woman named Megan. She is carrying his child and heir and I have taken it upon myself to b their protectors until the king is back. I am a friend of the Kings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silence fell. A silence so thick that you could cut it with a knife. &#34;Cassie is his wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yea but Megan is his mate. She is carrying his heirs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian shot me a look that I didn&#39;t return. How could I explain to him when I wasn&#39;t sure what had happened myself. I was a king and I was meant to be powerful. And yet a weak wolf like Megan had made me into a joke. She had lied once about being pregnant, no doubt using Cassies results but I had no doubt that she was pregnant now. She had trapped me, drugged me and extracted my seed to use. I was the father of her baby and I hadn&#39;t even touched her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I see and talk to this Megan.&#34; The Lycan kings voice had turned into a low whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; Duncan nodded his head in a show of servitude that I didn&#39;t believe for one second. Both me and Ian knew what Duncan was capable of. What he had always been capable of. Most of what his parents had been condemned for had been his handy working . They had died trying to protect him and he hadn&#39;t shed one tear.  &#34;Bring the lady Megan to us.&#34; He directed no one an everyone at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan herself appeared a few minutes later. Demurely walking on bare feet , her dress floating around her body like a shroud.  Her face was a mixture of panic and defiance. But it quickly changed to panic when she saw the Lycans. Dropping to a curtesy she stared down at her feet. &#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to - oh-&#34; she gasped as a giant hand settled over her stomach. Wildly she looked around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Lycans lips curled upwards and he stepped back. A look of complete and utter disgust on his face. &#34;You are with child and you say it is Julian&#39;s?&#34; He asked angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I lost our first in a car crash. I treasure this one in the hopes my love comes back to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you are able to.&#34; His eyes raked over Duncan and his lips turned downward in a sneer. &#34;I would suggest choosing your protectors more carefully though.&#34; He took a deep breath. &#34;But this does change things. Under Lycan lore a marriage without young is not official. Megan is King Julian&#39;s mate and luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the Lycans will not forget your kings disrespect to our people. When he took another to his bed and shared his seed with her he went against his vows to the goddess and to my daughter.  Such disrespects will not be forgotten.&#34; Turning in a circle, he spread his arms wide. &#34;But if something happens to my daughter.&#34; His voice grew lower. &#34;If something happens to my daughter, then I will hold every single member of this species personally responsible. Everyone who calls this place home will pay for her pain.&#34; He smiled. &#34;I am Caspian, king of the Lycans and I have spoken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stumbled back from the grate. &#34;What the hell just happened?&#34; I asked Ian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think.&#34; He stuttered. &#34;I think the Lycans just threatened war on us.&#34;</p>
