                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting cross legged on the narrow bed with the blankets over my knees I gazed down at the two tiny boys in my arms. They looked so much like Julian with their silky hair and piercing eyes that looked up at me. There was wisdom and knowledge in their young eyes. Almost like they recognised me and understood what I was saying to them which was amazing because I didn&#39;t really understand what I was going on about. I was just rambling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish your daddy was here because he would love you so much. He would know what the Goddess wanted you to be named. But he&#39;s not and I have to try and figure it out.&#34; I sighed. It had been hours since everyone had left me and I was trying not to worry about Ian. &#34;He loves you though.&#34; I told them and they blinked like they agreed with me. &#34;He would be here if he could.&#34; I frowned, my eyebrows pinching together. &#34;I wish he was here Niall.&#34; I frowned harder. It was so strange because my husband had made my life hell almost constantly. There were only a handful of times where he had been sweet and kind and passionate. It was that passion that had put my sons in my arms. Julian had failed me on so many levels but when I had needed him he had always come through and saved me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was locked in a dungeon cell right here in this house and he was taking the torture and not telling our enemies that I was still here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still trying to protect us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never thought I would miss him and want him by my side but I did , there was no denying that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He would love you so much Noah.&#34; Leaning down I kissed one wrinkly forehead and then the other. &#34;And you as well Niall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have chosen names then?&#34; Ian said softly and I blinked up at him because I hadn&#39;t heard him come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing from him to the children in my arms I smiled. I hadn&#39;t even realised I&#39;d been calling them by their goddess given names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it would seem.&#34; I bent over them again. Pressing my lips to their soft silky hair. &#34;Niall and Noah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect names for perfect princes.&#34; Ian moved into the room and began piling bread and cheese into two small plates. &#34;Have you eaten anything?&#34; He asked with his back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not hungry.&#34; I stared at his back. He was acting shifty again. Like he was hiding something from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to eat and keep your strength up. If not for yourself then for them? Plus-&#34; he shook his head. &#34;I&#39;m going to try and get us out of here on the full moon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at him in shock. &#34;On the next full moon?&#34; Frowning I shook my head. &#34;Surely that&#39;s the most dangerous time for us to move. Everyone will be at the full moon run. They will smell us or we will be seen. If they catch sight of me they will-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to me and there was anger on his face. I swallowed hard.  maybe he was still angry at me and that&#39;s exactly what he wanted. He had his own family to get back to and protect. And they would need protecting now there was a new king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok.&#34; I went back to looking at my sons. &#34;I don&#39;t feel comfortable leaving Julian.&#34; I side eyed him. &#34;I didn&#39;t think you would want to leave your king either. I thought he was your friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it was the wrong thing to say the moment I had said it. Ian&#39;s face darkened. &#34;I am loyal to my king. How dare you insinuate otherwise. I have given up my own happiness to keep him safe, to keep you safe.&#34; He hissed and somehow him not shouting was worse than if he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He threw up a hand to silence me. &#34;Eat Cassie and stop making my job harder than it needs to be. I am loyal to my king and to my queen.&#34; His eyes met mine and he didn&#39;t blink. &#34;You are my queen. Those two babies are princes. I am doing what Julian would want me to do and keep the three of you safe.&#34; Tearing into the bread he put a chunk of it on the plates. &#34;Now come and eat, Niall and Noah are asleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes flicked down and I smiled. They were asleep. For newborns they slept a lot , almost like they knew they had to be quiet. Placing them side by side on the bed I climbed off and went towards him. Gratefully taking the plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Ian.&#34; I muttered around a mouthful of bread. &#34;You know I didn&#39;t mean to say you would betray Julian. I know you wouldn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would. If it meant keeping Yana and you three safe I would betray him in a heart beat and he would expect me to. He would even want me to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does he know about Yana?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed. &#34;No. One day I&#39;ll tell him. But when things are better. He will understand better then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I allowed the silence to flow around us as we ate in silence. &#34;You were gone for hours.&#34; I filled the quiet with pointless words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to check something out. These tunnels and rooms are old but there&#39;s even older ones. I needed to see if one of those ones is clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it?&#34; I asked hopefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;Not yet but it will be soon. Means you will be alone quite a bit though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s heavy work and I&#39;m not saying you couldn&#39;t help but it&#39;s no place for babies. Dusty and if there is a cave in-&#34; he trailed off. He didn&#39;t need to say anything anymore. I understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get it-&#34; a splitting pain lanced through my chest. In the flesh between my heart and my shoulder. Crying out I smashed my hand against it like I expected to find myself stabbed and bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie?&#34; Ian jumped from his seat. His eyes wide with fear. &#34;Cassie what is wrong. Are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mutely I shook my head. It did hurt but I wasn&#39;t hurt. The pain wasn&#39;t mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian.&#34; Panting heavily I took off at a run. &#34;Stay with the. Babies.&#34; I ordered over my shoulder as I sprinted towards the secret passages that would take me to my dying mate.</p>
