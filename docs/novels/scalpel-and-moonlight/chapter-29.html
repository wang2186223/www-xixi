                <p>Sitting cross legged on the massive bed in the master bedroom I found myself smiling down at the laptop screen on the bed in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew all those emails I had sent out would come back sooner or later and finally they had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure it wasn&#39;t the job I was looking for but then no shifter hospital in the country would go against Julian&#39;s wishes and he didn&#39;t want me to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People thought it was because he wanted me all to himself and was keen to start a family but I knew the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My husband hated me , not because I had done anything wrong but because I was me. He didn&#39;t want to be happy and start a family. He wanted to hurt me and for no reasons but I was in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand went to my stomach. My flat stomach. I still hadn&#39;t had my period and that was worrying but I had never been regular anyway more than likely all the stress had just thrown my cycle out. After all, I had taken what was needed to prevent the pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s reaction if I had been pregnant didn&#39;t bear thinking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I wouldn&#39;t think about it. I wasn&#39;t going to have a baby and I would be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the job offer in front of me was the first step on that journey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning forward I reread the email and grinned. It wasn&#39;t my dream job but it was perfect for right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian, oh mighty king in bloody waiting might be the boss of everyone but he wasn&#39;t the boss of the internet and he couldn&#39;t keep me off of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giggling to myself I reached down and began typing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you giggling about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrieked at the sound of Julian&#39;s voice. Slamming the laptop shut I jumped off the bed. Putting it between me and him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I asked keeping my eyes locked to his face and not letting them wander down his body. &#34;Get out.&#34; I pointed to the door like I expected him to listen. I doubted Julian had ever listened a day in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll answer yours if you answer mine.&#34; He said smoothly as he walked into the room and started pulling open drawers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help it. My eyes watched him move, taking in the wet dark hair and the water that dripped lazily down the hard muscles of his chest. The moment my gaze reached the towel wrapped around his waist I looked away and blushed but not before he caught me staring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Having a good look are you Skye?&#34; He mocked me. &#34;And to answer your question. This is my house and this is my bedroom. I&#39;ve come to get dressed. If you don&#39;t like it then you can leave.&#34; He winked. &#34;But you do like it don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goddess, I hated him. I didn&#39;t know what he was playing at right now but I knew he was up to something and more than likely it was something that I wasn&#39;t going to like very much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t once stepped foot in this room. I don&#39;t even know why your -&#34; I stared down at the neatly folded clothes in the drawer. His clothes. They hadn&#39;t been there this morning when I dressed which meant he had planned this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, Julian?&#34; I asked again and this time my voice came out calm. Being hysterical was only feeding his desire to torment me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no.&#34; His hands went to the towel and my head snapped away. &#34;You owe me an answer now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not even think about taking the towel off you asshole.&#34; I hissed out of the corner of my mouth. Keeping my eyes locked to the wall. &#34;If you want to get naked then go somewhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed , a great big booming laugh that seemed to echo around me. &#34;Is it just me you don&#39;t want to see naked then dear wife? You don&#39;t seem to have a problem with any other men do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting my lip I counted to ten. Telling myself over and over again that I would not rise to his jibes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now answer my question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which one?&#34; I retorted. &#34;You&#39;ve asked me several in the last few seconds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly I regretted my words. Anger filled his eyes with darkness. I took an unsettled step forward as he stalked towards me. Trapping me against the wall with his hands either side of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the name of the man who was just making you giggle?&#34; His breath washed over me. Minty fresh but that wasn&#39;t what was distracting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of his skin fresh out of the shower was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His name.&#34; He snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goddess.&#34; I shook my head. &#34;There is no other man. And even if there was. What do you care? It&#39;s not like you have stayed true to your vows either. Anyone would think you were jealous?.&#34; I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An angry growl fell from his lips. He slammed one hand down onto the wall by my head. Making me jump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warily I lifted my eyes to meet his. The look on his face was terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I shouldn&#39;t have said that.&#34; I back peddled quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No you shouldn&#39;t.&#34; He snarled and the sound vibrated from his chest to mine. &#34;Tell me his name so I can have grounds for divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan?&#34; I said sweetly because clearly I didn&#39;t know when to keep my mouth shut. &#34;It was an email. That&#39;s all Julian. I have done nothing wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No?&#34; He raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked away again quickly. &#34;Well no more than you. It was an email.&#34; I said again. &#34;About a job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He roared so loudly that it felt like my ear drum would burst. Ducking under his arms I made my escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is your problem, Julian? I need to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;ve told you no. I won&#39;t have any wife of mine sulking around some hospital. I know what you&#39;re really like Skye and I don&#39;t trust you around all those tempting doctors plus we have an image to maintain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to be in any hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was impossible. I was never going to get him to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t stop me working.&#34; Angrily I stamped my foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wanna bet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me.&#34; A timid voice spoke from the hallway outside our bedroom. &#34;I don&#39;t want to interrupt but dinner is ready. Where would you like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Together.&#34; Julian answered smoothly and with more warmth in his voice than I had ever heard before. &#34;We will eat together. All of our meals from now on.&#34; He turned his eyes to me and the warm friendliness he had just shown his house keeper evaporated. &#34;And you best act like a lady this time. If I see you using the wrong spoon then I&#39;ll-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t let him finish. I was so tired of this. Of him being a bully and of me being a pushover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curling my hand around the first thing I could grab I launched it towards his head.</p>
