                <p>The table and the people around it erupted into chaos. I may as well have suggested we cut off Julian&#39;s head and given it to Duncan the way they acted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Julian himself murmured something under his breath. It was Ian that didn&#39;t say a word. His face was completely impassive. Almost like he was made from carved marble. I couldn&#39;t get a read on what he was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t be serious.&#34; Someone said from the end of the table. The growl rumbling from his chest making it hard to make sense of his words. &#34;The cats are our enemy. Once upon a time we would wipe them out just for being near our land. They are lucky we even let them live.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian finally moved, shifting from one foot to another. He didn&#39;t say anything but at his sides his fingers flexed into his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well.&#34; I called out above the hubbub. &#34;Things have changed. Our enemy is our own kind now. That&#39;s who we are fighting again. Other wolves. You can stay in the past and die or step into the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More uproar. More than one set of eyes glared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think the queen has a good point.&#34; Julian said finally. And the crowd went quiet when he spoke. &#34;Maybe not with the cats because old hatred are hard to kill but with the others-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snarled at him. It hadn&#39;t gone unnoticed by me that the others had gone quiet when he spoke. They gave him respect where I got none. That was kind of to be expected because he was king , what wasn&#39;t expected was his total disregard to what I was saying. My idea was a good one, and he knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus the cats weren&#39;t our enemy. Old hatred&#39;s didn&#39;t die because we kept fueling them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing I looked around the table and like Ian my hands curled into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think Cassie is right.&#34; Scarlett said softly and like they had with me. The men around this table spoke over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had none from the men here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe we can -&#34; Julian was talking more loudly than anyone else. His voice booming out. His eyes were excited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The cats-&#34; I tried to cut in and again I was ignored. My patience snapped. Standing up suddenly, I half expected Julian to grab me back down and ask where I was going but one look at his face and I knew he hadn&#39;t even noticed I was gone.  The king was too busy playing war games for that to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my head I walked away. I would let him do what he needed to but I would do what I needed to do. I wanted my children back under any circumstances. And if that meant I had to make moves on my own then so be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would need help though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing out of the carved wooden door I lifted my face to the cold breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the plan?&#34; Ian said from my shoulder. He moved around me. So we were face to face and Scarlett took his place behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her in shock. &#34;We make our own plans.&#34; I said as I stared between the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going against the king?&#34; Scarlett whispered , her eyes growing saucer round as she gazed back into my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrapped my arms around myself. Shivering as the wind picked up. &#34;I&#39;ve never been the type to do what he told me to do anyway.&#34; I shrugged. &#34;And I&#39;m not working against him. I&#39;m doing what is best for him and the kingdom. But I understand if you don&#39;t want any part of it Scarlett. Your pack is in uproar as it is and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flung up her hand. &#34;Oh I&#39;m in one hundred percent.&#34; She laughed. &#34;I just needed to say it out loud and as for my,&#34; her eyes narrowed and darkened. &#34;Pack. I think there needs to be some changes to my council.&#34; Her eyes met mine. &#34;I think there needs to be changing to everything. The way he-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waved her words away. I knew what she was going to say. &#34;I know. And believe me I will be talking to him about it later. But for now we have more important things to worry about.&#34; Turning to Ian I nodded my head to him. &#34;I am sorry that your oldest friend is so full of hatred towards your mate Ian. I love Yanna like a sister and I hate to ask but.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to leave Julian and go and beg the panthers for help?&#34; His voice was guarded. And I could clearly see the uncertainty in his eyes. It was a new look on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian was always so sure of himself. He knew his own mind better than anyone else I had ever met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t leave Julian now. He&#39;s got enemies in every direction and my job is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I kept my voice low , cutting him off.&#34;I am asking for something worse than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yanna.&#34; Usually when he said his mates name, his face came alive. Now I watched it as it crumbled. &#34;You want me to get Yanna involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t ask if it wasn&#39;t important.&#34; I whispered. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t want her in harms way.&#34; I added as his eyes narrowed into slits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he shook his head. &#34;I could say no but she would kick my wolf ass.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;She wants to help Cassie. Just tell me what you need her to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Speak to the other Cat clans. Be our ambassador. We need the other shifters-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need the other shifters for what?&#34; Julian&#39;s arms wrapped around my waist and he drew me into him. I stiffened for a second before the warmth of his body forced me to relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when I was furious with him I melted against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing.&#34; I said quickly. &#34;We just came out here to discuss less important things. I didn&#39;t think it was a good idea to keep interrupting your very important manly meeting with our trivial matters.&#34; I lied sweetly but my voice dropped with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes widened in shock, his jaw clenched and then with a smile he relaxed. &#34;I think it&#39;s a great way to keep yourself busy. The adoption program.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fought back the urge to roll my eyes. Of course he thought that was a trivial female matter. My husband was a pig sometimes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. We are going to have a few meetings and start to get things moving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scarlett shifted the weight of the toddler she was carrying. He looked to be asleep now which was good. It was great that he felt safe in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why is Ian out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scrambled to think of a reason and failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie was asking him to train me up.&#34; Kip stepped forward with a bow. I frowned. I hadn&#39;t even noticed that he had followed us out. &#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you , your highness. I&#39;m Kip. The queen has asked me to be her bodyguard.&#34;</p>
