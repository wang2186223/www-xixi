                <p>I didn&#39;t know what to say. I didn&#39;t even know what to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smiling face seemed to be burnt behind my eyes. She had looked so happy this morning as I drove her to work. Even when she was pretending to be mad at me she couldn&#39;t help but smile. It was one of the only times I had actually seen her genuinely happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who knew when I would again because Megan was having my child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan was the one from that night. The one who had saved me. It had to be her. The dates on the paperwork made it that night but-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she just wasn&#39;t what i thought I would end up. I was pretty sure the wolf from that night, the she wolf who had taken me so lovingly into her body and protected me had felt different to me. She had felt beautiful even though I hadn&#39;t even seen her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that Megan wasn&#39;t beautiful because she was but she was hard. Not at all like the woman-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve walked her to her car.&#34; Ian slid into the seat opposite me. The one Megan had just vacated. Leaning his elbows on the table he stared at me. &#34;Julian.&#34; He sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34; I shook my head. &#34;What did you find out?&#34; I didn&#39;t even want to ask. But I needed to know. If the papers Megan had given me were fake he would find out. That was one of his gifts. He always found stuff out. Sometimes I wondered whether that was his power because he could always see things for what they were before I could. Maybe it was because I was so hot headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It all looks legit.&#34; He put the envelope in the table between us. &#34;But I will keep digging into it. Something doesn&#39;t sit right with me about this whole situation.&#34; He lifted his eyes to meet mine. &#34;Do you trust her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust Megan?&#34; Throwing back my head I laughed. &#34;I kind of have to if she&#39;s having my baby don&#39;t you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian&#39;s eyes grew shaded. &#34;She might be pregnant but we don&#39;t know yet that it&#39;s yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced down at the envelope before I could stop myself. I didn&#39;t know what I wanted. My grandfather would love the fact I would have an heir but did I really want a child with Megan? MEGAN?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corner of Ian&#39;s mouth twitched upwards. &#34;You and her seem to be getting on better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She drives me insane.&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian&#39;s twitching lips curved up into a beaming smile. &#34;I&#39;m sure she does but that doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t getting on better. You like her,&#34; he chuckled. &#34;Admit it , she is growing on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right. I kind of did like her.  Not that it mattered now. My shoulders slumped in defeat. &#34;I can&#39;t really go after her for cheating now can I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now that you have maybe got another woman pregnant?&#34; Ian&#39;s eyes found mine and narrowed. &#34;Probably not especially seeing as they are colleagues. I don&#39;t know what Cassie&#39;s reaction is going to be either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I do. She is going to want a divorce.&#34; I couldn&#39;t even blame her for that. Straying from our vows was one thing. Getting another woman pregnant was another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And will you give her one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the table my hand clenched into a fist. I hated the very thought of setting Cassie free. I hated her most of the time but that didn&#39;t mean I wanted to be free of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about we find out if this kid is yours before you decide what to do.&#34; Ian stood scraping back his chair. &#34;We need to get that blood tested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know someone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I do.&#34; Ian winked. &#34;Forrest is expecting us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forrest&#39;s office was a mirror to himself. Calm and organised but it didn&#39;t have a calming effect on me and as we waited for him to run tests in the lab I walked around and touched things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know why I was so on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to wear a hole in the carpet if you pace one more time.&#34; Ian chuckled from his seat by the desk. &#34;Are you nervous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freezing in spot I shot him a dirty look. &#34;Yes but that&#39;s not it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can smell Cassie in here.&#34; Ian said matter of factly. A wide grin on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffed. My nostrils flaring and there it was. Her scent. I didn&#39;t know why I hadn&#39;t smelt it at first because it was definitely her. She had been here, and recently and it made me wild with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy ripped through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can never understand why you don&#39;t smell her the way I do.&#34; Ian murmured. &#34;It&#39;s like she&#39;s hidden from you. I think if you could-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t get to finish the sentence as Forrest walked back through the door. His usually open and friendly face was troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The sample.&#34; He took a seat behind his desk. &#34;Who does it belong to.&#34; He clutched it in his hand like he was afraid to let it go.  That was strange but the look on his face was stranger. He genuinely looked scared but not for himself.  Did Forrest have a relationship with megan as well as my wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan.&#34; Ian answered when I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan&#39;s?&#34; Forrest&#39;s head shot up. &#34;Well.&#34; His Adam&#39;s apple bobbed as he swallowed hard. &#34;Then I guess congratulations are in order again, your highness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Again?&#34; My eyebrows shot up into my hair line. &#34;What do you mean again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A slip of the tongue your highness.&#34; Forrest back peddled fast. His face flushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So the baby is definitely his?&#34; Ian asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes there&#39;s no doubt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let the news hit me and flow through my body and I didn&#39;t feel a thing. My family would want me to keep it. An heir was important but - but.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at my watch I frowned. It was well passed six and I had promised Cassie I would take her to dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julian where are you going?&#34; Ian called out after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to get Cassie from work. I&#39;m taking my wife to dinner.&#34; I mumbled as I hurried away. I was rushing to take my wife to dinner even though I had impregnated another woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell even was my life?</p>
