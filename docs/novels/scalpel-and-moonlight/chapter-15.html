                <p>The grand splendour of the Hotel Royale rose up in front of me as I got out of the cab with some difficulty. The skirts of the forest green gown was tight. So tight that I could barely move in it. Whoever had designed it was a psychopath who didn&#39;t believe women should breathe but even I had to admit that I looked good in it. The colour really suited my dark hair and tanned skin and made my green eyes pop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still I could look like a supermodel all I wanted if I couldn&#39;t get out of the cab without falling on my face then it didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using all of my strength and cunning I finally managed it and the moment I did I wished I hadn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a limousine, long and sleek with blacked out windows parked just behind my cab. Right by the red carpet that wound its way into the grand entrance of the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My husband was standing there. Looking more handsome than any man I had ever seen in my life with his perfectly styled dark hair and his hard body encased in an all black suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked charming and for a second my breath caught in my throat as I waited for him to turn around and find me. This was the dress he had chosen for me after all and I wanted him to see me in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell I wanted him to want me as much as I wanted him at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he reached down and helped a woman out of the car. Smiling down at her as he slipped her hand into the crook of his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took it all in , in a second. Him all dark and tall and her- blonde and dripping in diamond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d always envied Megan her tiny frame and blonde hair but at that moment I hated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did she keep taking what was mine? First my dream job and now my- I swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Has she taken my husband from me or was he already hers. I didn&#39;t know anything about Megan&#39;s private life really. Only what she shared. And on the last count she has several men after her. It made sense that Julian would be one and dammit but I had to admit they looked good together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as I watched megan lifted her face to him, and smiled her most winning smile. Reaching up she touched his cheek as he grinned back down at her. I couldn&#39;t hear what was said but honestly I didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their flirting was embarrassing, not to mention humiliating. Had I really given up the chance to spend time with my mother for this. Julian didn&#39;t care if I was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was too engrossed in a tiny little blonde with more boobs than brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. That wasn&#39;t fair and I knew it. Megan was clever and a damn good doctor as well. I was just letting my jealousy take over when I had no right to be jealous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lots of couples had relationships like ours. Arrangements without love or affection. They made it work so there was no reason me and Julian couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that didn&#39;t mean I had to be here. He already had the guest of honour on his arm. He didn&#39;t need me third wheeling it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was just about to turn on my heel and disappear into the shadows to hail another cab when someone called my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze as my husband turned in my direction. What I suspected was his mistress still clutching his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened when he saw me, and the corners of his mouth twitched up but before his perfectly kissable lips could form a smile , Megan said something and he frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Groaning inwardly I went to meet them on the red carpet. And the people who had been waiting to greet him turned in shock. Murmurs rose up. Every single person around us knew who I was. They knew who I was to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan.&#34; Taking her by the shoulders I pressed my lips to her cheek. If the people who had gathered around expected me to make a scene they were going to be disappointed &#34;Julian.&#34; Reaching up I pressed my lips to his cheek in turn. And the moment I did , wetness pooled between my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s nostrils flared and for a second his hand came down on the small of my back and held me to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt it as well. The instant attraction that sparked to life any time we actually touched. I hated it just as much as I hated and wanted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped back quickly. &#34;It&#39;s so good to see you both.&#34; I gushed in an overly friendly voice as what seemed like every shifter in the town looked on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you two a couple?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes narrowed. The tip of his tongue came out to dampen his bottom lip as he stared at me and that look seemed to dare me to say something. To make some sort of scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t about to do anything of the sort. I wouldn&#39;t make that much of a fool of myself. And even though she seemed to be taking everything important from me, I just didn&#39;t hate Megan that much. This was her big night and I wanted her to enjoy it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell, I wanted to enjoy it as well. There were so few chances to get dressed up and let my hair down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You make a beautiful looking couple.&#34; I said with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger blazed to life in my husband&#39;s eyes. The kind of anger I couldn&#39;t ever hope to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man stepped up to Julian&#39;s side. Slightly smaller but wider through the shoulders he was handsome. He would have even been called hot if he hadn&#39;t been standing next to Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was also familiar but I couldn&#39;t place him.  Maybe he just had one of those faces. Although I wasn&#39;t sure that was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you escort Cassie to her seat and tell her the arrangements for this evening.&#34; Without looking back Julian walked on, taking Megan with him and ignoring me completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you and Cassie-&#34; I heard Megan ask as the newcomer stepped in front of me with a small bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are nothing. I barely know her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tearing my eyes away from my husbands retreating back I gave the wolf called Ian my full attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I was miles away. &#34; shaking myself I forced myself to smile. &#34;You&#39;re his Beta?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes , my friends call me Ian. Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patting his arm I slid my hand into his elbow. &#34;And my friends call me Cassie. So what arrangements do I need to know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked slowly, like he knew any pace other than a crawl was impossible in my snug dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just for afterward. All you need to do is signal me and I&#39;ll have the car pulled around for you to take you to the palace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet faltered and I dragged him to a stop. &#34;What do you mean the palace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The king is expecting you on this full moon. Julian always -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t.&#34; I shook my head , and a curl came loose and fell over my face. &#34;My mother is awake now and I need to spend time with her plus I always do the full moon run with my-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cut me off with a look. &#34;That&#39;s your old life Cassie. If the king calls for you then you go plus Julian is insistent that you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t really care what Julian wants to be honest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian&#39;s eyes darkened. &#34;You should care Cassie. There&#39;s a thousand other girls who would die for your place as Luna. He&#39;s handsome and -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the distance, just disappearing into the hotels glitzy foyer I found my husband&#39;s form. He was handsome , that was true but he was also several other things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And a pervert?&#34; I asked sweetly and Ian&#39;s eyes widened in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handsome and  a pervert that was husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at least for the next few hours he was someone else&#39;s problem.</p>
