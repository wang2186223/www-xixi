                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe it even though the proof was right there in front of my eyes. Megan had drugged me. And just when I was starting to trust her. Which was just stupid of me. I&#39;d always known that she couldn&#39;t be trusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Women like Megan never could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that a puncture?&#34; Forrest sounded confused and I couldn&#39;t blame him for that. I was confused as well because if Megan had drugged me and then injected me in the stomach when I was unconscious then she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real question was how did she know I was pregnant? I&#39;d only just found out myself and yet somehow she knew. Nothing was safe. Not even my twins and they were cradled inside my body. Lovingly I ran my fingers over the mark before covering my stomach and finally meeting Forrest&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I&#39;m guessing Megan injected me with something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forrest&#39;s mouth fell open in shock. &#34;Why would she do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything, I didn&#39;t really need to. Forrest was a clever man and he would figure it out sooner or later. If he hadn&#39;t already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because she&#39;s a bitch.&#34; Groaning, I pushed myself up to sitting and even that small movement made everything hurt. I whimpered. I didn&#39;t feel right at all. Everything felt kind of tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell had Megan given me? There were numerous drugs she could have put in the water to knock me out but it wasn&#39;t that I was worried about. It was what she had injected me in the stomach with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were my babies ok?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forrest?&#34; I asked weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Cassie.&#34; He answered instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I need to go and get checked out in the emergency room.&#34; Again I caressed my stomach and this time my voice was thick with unshed tears. Panic gripped me in its icy gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second Forrest just stared at me and then something that looked like realisation flickered to life in his forest green eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. Let me get us closer to the entrance so you don&#39;t have to walk.&#34; He clambered out of the car. &#34;Just try and relax ok. I&#39;ll look after you.&#34; He moved around the car and got in behind the wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to relax as we drove for a few minutes towards the main hospital building but it was almost impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could i relax when this was all my own fault. I had let my guard down around Megan even though I knew she was dangerous. Hell it had been less than twenty four hours since she attacked me and now she had done it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only this time it was my babies she was trying to hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blamed myself for other reasons as well. More personal reasons because I&#39;d thought about having an abortion. In fact I&#39;d seriously considered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of mother did that make me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of mum would I be, when I couldn&#39;t keep them safe?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here we are. Hold on on.&#34; Forrest slammed the breaks on and I went lurching forward with a fresh cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trying.&#34; I said softly in a whisper. &#34;Just hold on.&#34; I told the two little lives nestling in my stomach. &#34;Please be ok.&#34; I begged them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here let me carry you.&#34; Forrest lifted me easily into his arms. Cradling me like a baby and I didn&#39;t fight against him. Instead I let my head fall onto his chest and closed my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There would be other times for me to be a strong independent woman but they weren&#39;t now. Right at this second I just wanted to be looked after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Forrest. I don&#39;t know what I would do without you.&#34; I whispered. Cold rain drops landed on the naked skin of my stomach. My shirt must have risen up when he had lifted me from the car but I was just to tired and scared to cover myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care who saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just wanted to make sure my babies were ok.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was the loud squeal of tires but I ignored them. People were always rushing in and out of the emergency room but I couldn&#39;t worry about them right now even though I was a doctor and it was my job. I had to concentrate on myself right now. And the two little lives growing inside of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The roar was even louder than the screeching tires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew the sound of that growl and I knew who it belonged to.  I stiffened in Forrest&#39;s arm, panicking wildly because the last person I wanted to see right now was my husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s on Cassie. It&#39;s ok. Settle down.&#34; Forrest tried to smooth me. &#34;I phoned him ok.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze. Frowning up into his face. &#34;Why would you do that?&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He needed to know Cassie.&#34; Forrest whispered back and then he snapped his lips together and Julian&#39;s face came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is happening here?&#34; He was angry and I didn&#39;t know why. But his eyes were murderous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I found her, your highness.&#34; Forrest answered quickly and quietly. &#34;On the edge of the parking lot. Unconscious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t put up a fight when Julian tried to take me from his arms.  I did though. I didn&#39;t want to be held in Julian&#39;s arms. I didn&#39;t want him to look after me. I wanted someone I liked and trusted with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; Julian&#39;s eyes raked down over my stomach before landing on my stomach with a scowl. My blood ran cold. Did he know as well? How was it possible that everyone had found out already?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ian.&#34; He barked an order and his Beta stepped towards their car. Opening the back seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get off me.&#34; I started to struggle. &#34;I don&#39;t need to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop fighting me Cassie. I am here to make sure you are ok?&#34; There was something in his voice that made me pause. He was barely containing his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get here so quickly?&#34; Forrest asked, bringing up the rear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were close by.&#34; Ian asked smoothly. &#34;On pack business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I risked a glance up at Julian&#39;s face and a frown knitted my eyebrows together. They just happened to be close by on pack business? It seemed to much of a coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had my husband,had Julian been privy to Megan&#39;s plan? For all I knew he had been the one to do the planning, not her. He sure hated me enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It actually made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two deserve each other.&#34; I hissed as Julian took a seat in the car with me firmly on his lap and the door shut behind us. &#34;I hate you both.&#34;</p>
