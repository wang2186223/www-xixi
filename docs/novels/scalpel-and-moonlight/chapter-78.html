                <p>&#34;Where was he?&#34; I paced back and forth as the man who was head of my security watched me through his eyelashes.  Usually I wouldn&#39;t trust anything this important to him but Ian wasn&#39;t available. No matter how much I needed him to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Currently he&#39;s being checked out.&#34;</p>

                <p>Slowly he lifted his eyes to meet mine. &#34;She drugged him alpha. Tied him up and left him in a locked store cupboard. We only found him because a janitor needed something. It looks like he&#39;s been there for a few hours.&#34; He went back to looking at his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She drugged him?&#34; I didn&#39;t want to believe that Cassie was capable of such a thing but part of me did. She had the access to the drugs she needed to do and Cassie was a determined woman. The only thing I didn&#39;t really understand was why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why drug and tie up the man who was there to protect her. Why discharge her mother and not come home to somewhere it was safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His car is gone. There&#39;s some cctv footage of it leaving the hospital and I have men looking at the cameras around town. We will find it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Car.&#34; A new voice snapped from the doorway. &#34;Is in Clarkson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to find Ian standing there. Leaning heavily on the door frame his face was pale grey with the strain of being on his feet too soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ian.&#34; Rushing forward I took his arm and helped him into the nearest seat. &#34;What the hell are you doing out of the hospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine Julian. You fuss like a woman.&#34; He grinned but there was pain in her eyes that he couldn&#39;t hide. &#34;Plus I knew you would need my help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could have managed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You guys are skilled but I am the one who out the tracker in her car.&#34; He said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at him in shock. &#34;You did what?&#34; I turned to him in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I put a tracker in the cars I thought she might take. I didn&#39;t make a big deal about it because I knew you would agree that keeping her safe was paramount.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is.&#34; I said gruffly. From the corner , forgotten because truthfully if I could kick her out I would Megan bristled. I didn&#39;t even know why she was insisting to be in my office for this meeting. It wasn&#39;t like she cared about Cassie&#39;s safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think they were kidnapped?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; He said and that one word hit me like a freight train. I stumbled backwards like it had been a physical blow. Taking several deep breaths I turned to him.  &#34;What do you mean no?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to shake him until he told me but he had already put his health at risk discharging himself from the hospital before his broken body was mended. And me losing my temper would make things worse without actually helping my situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think she run.&#34; He said simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wouldn&#39;t-&#34; The anger that bubbled up in my chest was overwhelming. &#34;She wouldn&#39;t dare, the contact and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian threw his head back and laughed and it was a sarcastic mirthless sound. &#34;Do you think Cassie cares about that? She&#39;s never wanted the money or any of the material things other women wanted.&#34; His eyes darted towards Megan who had given up pretending to look at her phone and was listening intently instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s always just wanted a family and love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really think she ran away?&#34; I couldn&#39;t help the pain in my voice. Last night had been amazing between us. At least for me. I had thought things had changed for the better between us and that she understood my predicament.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t you?&#34; Ian sighed. &#34;She&#39;s been mistreated and unloved her entire life Julian.&#34; He sighed. &#34;Yes she ran. She grabbed her mum and left you. It&#39;s the only thing that makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sense?&#34; I muttered and began pacing again. None of this made sense. If Cassie wanted to run she would have done it before today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could stop myself my eyes met Megan&#39;s and I frowned. She was the catalyst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inwardly I groaned. &#34;Cassie should have let me explain.&#34; Except I wouldn&#39;t have explained. I would have tortured Cassie with Megan&#39;s very presence by day and then crawled into her bed and made love to her all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My relationship with my wife was all sorts of messed up and I knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But ok, let&#39;s go and get the car. She can&#39;t be far. A single penniless woman and her sick mother.&#34; I headed towards the door. It would be easy to track them down. And then I would bring her home and things would change. I would change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or I would try at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unless she has help.&#34; Megan piped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, turning on her with a growl. &#34;What do you mean?&#34; I gritted out between my clenched teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes. &#34;It&#39;s not like she could have done it without help is it? You said so yourself Julian. She is useless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. Those hadn&#39;t been my words but she did have a point. It was feasible that my wife had had help to escape me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who would do that? &#34;Dig into-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan laughed. &#34;Oh come on Julian. There is only one person who would. Of course they pretend to just be friends.&#34; She air quoted theatrically with a roll of her eyes. &#34;But we all know the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rage that had been boiling through me turned deadly cold. It was like nothing I had ever felt before because I knew who she was talking about and suddenly it all made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had always suspected they had been too close to just be friends and now I knew the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send some people after my wife.&#34; I growled out to the head of my security. &#34;And find Forrest.&#34; At my side my hands clenched into fists. &#34;Bring Forrest to me.&#34;</p>
