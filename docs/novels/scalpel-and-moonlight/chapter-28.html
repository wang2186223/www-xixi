                <p>&#34;Oh mama.&#34; I beamed at the woman in the bed and she smiled right back.  It didn&#39;t matter how much I was hurting on the inside seeing her looking so much better lifted my spirits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she did look better. There were hardly any wires now and all of the tubes were gone. She actually looked younger than she had in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been so long since she had first fallen ill that I had somehow forgotten how beautiful she once was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see it again now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look so good.&#34; I rushed forward and her hand went to her hair and patted it self consciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One of the lovely nurses was he and fixed my hair. Do you think your dad will like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart plummeted into my shoes. Pulling over a chair with a scrap I sat down and took her hand in mine. &#34;Let&#39;s not talk about boys here.&#34; I forced a happy note into my voice even though inside I was screaming. &#34;Our husbands aren&#39;t here.&#34; I lowered my voice like we were two best friends sharing a secret. &#34;So we can have some real girl talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence for several long second and I could tell that she knew the truth. That her husband and my father wasn&#39;t coming. He hadn&#39;t changed his ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He loved her as much as he loved me. Not at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh girl talk sounds good.&#34; She squeezed my fingers and giggled but it was the kind of laugh that hid the need to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So was I. My father had royally screwed me over. The amount on  the cheque wasn&#39;t even half of what he owed me. Not even close and I had been kicking myself all morning that I hadn&#39;t  checked the cheque in front of him. I could have done something about it if I had but there was no way I would lower myself to go back and beg for the rest. I would rather die first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I could get legal advice. Technically the money was mine and my mothers and he had no right to it. He definitely didn&#39;t have the right to spend it on his mistress and their kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still legal advice was expensive and I knew how much money was on that cheque. Just enough for me to get by with mum for a little while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tiny while really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Skye,&#34; my mother said softly and I shook myself. Plastering my face with a smile so I looked happy. Even if I didn&#39;t feel it. The least I could do for her after everything she had been through was pretend to be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry mamma , I fell into a daydream then. Thinking about how happy I am.&#34; I added as an after thought and the moment I did I regretted it. I sounded like I was trying to hard to make her believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Skye.&#34; She pulled her hand away from mine and the look on her face was one she had worn a lot when I was a child if I was naughty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like a naughty child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What aren&#39;t you telling me? You were never good at hiding things.&#34; Her eyes darted over my face and she sighed. &#34;Your father.&#34; She masked the pain in her voice with a shrug. &#34;I know he&#39;s not coming. I have always know what he is like. If you are worried about my feelings then you don&#39;t have to be. I learnt early on in our marriage to harden my heart around him. But is that all you are worried about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I was going to tell her everything now was the time but i wasn&#39;t going to tell her. My mother had enough to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t her problem that I was a jobless , almost penniless woman in a loveless marriage. Those were my problems. She had enough  going on just getting better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; I lied. &#34;I was worried about that.&#34; The lie slipped from my lips so easily and once I started lying i couldn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want to bring it up and make you sad. And I don&#39;t want you to worry because I&#39;m going to look after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow I added silently. I had no job anymore thanks to my darling husband and the money in my account wouldn&#39;t last long with ongoing medical bills but somehow I knew I would manage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I always managed , it was just what I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath I leant forward, resting my elbows on the edge of her hospital bed. &#34;I know it&#39;s early days and you might not want to do it but I&#39;ve been thinking.&#34; I took a deep breath. &#34;I want to open my own clinic. It&#39;s always been a dream of mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes darted back and forth over my face. &#34;You have , that or join the royal medical unit.&#34; She admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well joining the unit now would take me away from you so that&#39;s a no.&#34; I didn&#39;t bother to tell her that my spot had been snatched from me. It was another thing she didn&#39;t need to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I don&#39;t want to do that. So I was thinking maybe a clinic, maybe I could do some more charity work as well. Work with those in the paranormal community that can&#39;t afford proper care. I do it a few times a month anyway but I always feel like I could be doing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what about your job here Skye.&#34; My mothers eyes darkened. &#34;Shouldn&#39;t you be at work right now actually?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blew out a breath, my lips pursed. I was going to lie to her face again but really I didn&#39;t have any other choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I took some vacation time so I can be with you. But what do you say? Do you fancy working and living with your one and only daughter?&#34; I teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about your husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Averting my eyes I forced myself to giggle. &#34;Oh I forgot about him. Sometimes I forget I&#39;m married at all, it&#39;s all so new.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside I giggled. Sometimes I wished I could forget I was married, was more like it but I couldn&#39;t say that to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;m sure me and Julian will work something out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or at least I would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would find us a home and a regular income coming in so we could live. I would make sure our dreams came true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I needed to do was get a job and free myself from a husband that despised me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No easy feat when that husband was the heir to the werewolf king.</p>
