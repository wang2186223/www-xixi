                <p>I tried to enjoy the rest of the day, and at times I forgot everything whirling around my brain and did and then all the thoughts would come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan might be nothing more than his friend and his doctor. He might even believe that but she had taken my place in his life so completely. The fact that he had taken her on holiday with my boys was sickening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But did I have a right to be jealous? I had been asleep, dreaming of a life with him which was so much different to this one. Did I really expect him to not have touched a woman in all that time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, of course not. I wasn&#39;t a monster. I knew he would have tried to get on with his life. I just didn&#39;t want the other woman to be her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always wanted my life and now she had it. The only thing she didn&#39;t have was a wedding ring on her finger and the title of queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stiffened as Julian&#39;s arms came around me. His bristly chin came down to rest on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did the boys go down ok?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded mutely. I didn&#39;t trust myself to speak just yet. My mind was whirling too much for me to sound normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; His sigh fluttered my hair against my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; I lied , turning into him. I wrapped my arms around his neck and reaching up I pressed my lips to his. &#34;I&#39;m just a little tired. The boys were full of energy today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cracked a smile. &#34;They like having you home. They needed their mum. I just never realised how much they needed you until you woke up. You&#39;re so good with them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything. He meant well. I knew that but to my overthinking brain he sounded like he was giving an employee a review.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like having you home as well.&#34; He said huskily. His eyes darkened. &#34;I&#39;ve missed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been right here for weeks.&#34; I gave a small shrug. &#34;It&#39;s not my fault that you didn&#39;t want to touch me.&#34; Biting my lip I trailed off. I hadn&#39;t meant to say that out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;Is that what you thought?&#34; He asked roughly. &#34;That I didn&#39;t want to touch you? Goddess.&#34; He tugged at his hair, turning away from me so my arms fell back to my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he turned back, his eyes were wild. &#34;Touching you is something I&#39;ve always wanted to do. Even when I thought I hated you.&#34; He chuckled , I didnt. My face turned stony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to touch you, every minute of the day Cassie.&#34; He said softly. &#34;I just didn&#39;t want to rush you. I didn&#39;t want-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut him off. &#34;Have you been -&#34; I paused and swallowed hard. &#34;Has there been someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;What? No!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s understandable.&#34; I continued , ignoring his wild look. I needed to say this. I needed to get it off of my chest. &#34;I was -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gripped my hips, painfully hard. &#34;There&#39;s not been anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t mind.&#34; I lied. &#34;I would understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s not anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as it&#39;s over now.&#34; I finished and finally let my eyes dart up to meet his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is no one else Cassie. Please believe me in that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded truthful and I couldn&#39;t smell any lies on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tugging me towards him, he pressed his lips to mine. &#34;I was a fool before. I know that and you&#39;ve always known that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help it , I cracked a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the moment I saw you in that hospital bed, fighting for your life. Fighting for our babies lives. I knew how fucked up, I&#39;d got things. That was the moment I knew for certain you were my mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at him. There he went again. Saying that. &#34;Your mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. And when you are ready I plan on making that official.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are already married.&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I didn&#39;t even show up.&#34; He shook his head. &#34;So once you are comfortable and back to full strength. When you feel ready I would like to do it again. Have a big get together. Celebrate properly.&#34; Another swipe of his lips against mine. &#34;And when the wedding is over , I will take you away from the party and make you my mate in front of the goddess. She has already blessed us with twins , so I know more babies will come. In time.&#34; He winked. &#34;There&#39;s no rush for that. I kind of want you all to myself for a life&#39;s while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened and my mouth fell open. &#34;You mean that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I mean that. I just need to wait patiently for you to catch up.&#34; Tenderly his fingers slid down my throat. Skipping across my collar bone. Bending down he replaced his fingers with his lips. Biting down softly. &#34;I&#39;ll mark you here and then only the goddess can part us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a shaky breath. Julian wanted me,as more than his wife. He wanted me as his queen. That meant something. It meant that his heart was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face softened. &#34;Tomorrow I will show you to the world Cassie. As my queen. It will change everything. It will be the start of our life together. If you will have me without anymore doubt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second I searched his face and then I nodded. I needed this fresh start with no more doubts or secrets between us just like he had said. We both did. Our family did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have got you a dress.&#34; He said with a smile. &#34;I hope you don&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. A wide smile on his face. &#34;It&#39;s perfect for you and of course you will wear the queens jewels as well. And neither one of them will even compare to how beautiful you will look. But it would make me happy if you wore it and let me- let me show you off. As my wife, as my mate.&#34; He took a deep breath. &#34;As my queen.&#34;</p>
