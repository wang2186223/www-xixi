                <p>The line went dead and with it the lights. Like someone had cut the power. Sitting up in bed with my dead laptop on my lap I fought the urge to curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d been talking to me. I had actually heard her voice and it was even sweeter than I remembered. And then something had gone wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A power cut?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, I knew deep down that it wasn&#39;t that. The palace had back up generators. That meant someone had cut the power and there was only one person in the world clever and sneaky enough to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting up in bed, I quieted my breathing. Listening to the sound of the house and the staff that were now rushing around downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the danger wasn&#39;t from downstairs. The danger was right here in the room with me. Now I was concentrating I could hear the quiet shallow breaths of another person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, not another person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were three people in this room. One of which was me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffed, my nostrils flaring just the smallest amount as I tried to catch a hint of the persons scent but there was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was almost like it was my imagination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly I turned my head every which way, trying to pick apart the shadows that hugged the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re highness.&#34; A sharp knock on the door but I didn&#39;t turn my head towards it. My eyes were glued to the corner of the far wall. And in those shadows someone watched me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok my highness?&#34; The stressed male voice came from the other side of the door. &#34;We are checking the perimeter and your guards are on standby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still I didn&#39;t talk. I didn&#39;t blink either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall I get them to come here or would you prefer to move to a more secure location?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A more secure location? The safe rooms. I realised with a start. The palace was full of them. Hidden behind the walls along with miles and miles of tunnels and passageways. I&#39;d completely forgotten about them but I knew without question that the person lingering in my room hadn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s how they had gotten in unseen. They had used those secret passageways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards could search all they liked, they would never find him or any threat because that threat was waiting patiently in the corner of my room and was much to clever to ever be caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even by me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine where I am, thank you. All is well.&#34; It wasn&#39;t a lie. If my intruder wanted me dead then I would have been dead by now. That meant he wanted to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which suited me fine because I had plenty to say to him. Although I would have preferred to have been talking to my wife and not him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sure that&#39;s it&#39;s just a short circuit.&#34; I lied , my eyes glued to the corner when a deeper darker shadow was detaching itself from the others. The movement was so tiny that I wouldn&#39;t have been able to notice it if I hadn&#39;t been looking for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just call out if you need anything King Julian. Someone will be close by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t move as the sound of footsteps moved back down the hallway. Silence fell again. Punctuated only by the sound of us all breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can show yourself now.&#34; I said in a tired whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing moved for several long seconds and then something heavy hit the hardwood floor, my eyes darted downward to where something vaguely man shaped lay in a bloody heap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has the answers you need Julian.&#34; A familiar voice murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who is he?&#34; In the darkness I couldn&#39;t see much of the man&#39;s features but I was guessing even in the light I would find it hard. His face was just a bloody pulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The key to your destruction? Or if used correctly, maybe your salvation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not like you to talk in riddles, old friend?&#34; I countered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laughter was mocking. &#34;Am I still your friend Julian? Even with the lies I have told you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused. &#34;Lies upon lies but yes you are my friend. You are more than that you are my brother. I know why you did what you did. I know why you told those disgusting lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an intake of breath. So quiet and subtle that I almost didn&#39;t hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then take this friendly warning. Question him about the flash drive in his pocket. Study it. It will tell you all you need to know about the woman you are having a baby with-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you know some of the truth already. Be careful with the knowledge Julian and do what you think is right but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held my breath because I knew what he was going to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t leave her alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both knew I was talking about Cassie and not Megan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as Megan has her claws into you , you must. You have to choose Julian. Once and for all. You can&#39;t have both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no choice , not really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you cannot break free of the tangle you are in, you must let them go and be free. I know you have been in contact with her. She tried to hide it but I saw the doubt about what she was doing grow in her eyes. I heard your phone call to her just now. But you are going to get them killed ,Julian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sucked in a deep breath because everything he was saying was correct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love them.&#34; It sounded lame even to my own ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you love them. Truly love them, then you will let them go and be happy or you will sort this mess out once and for all and treat her the way she deserves to be treated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that as well. &#34;I&#39;m trying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try harder.&#34; He snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if I can&#39;t make it safe for them?&#34; Defeated I let my head drop. &#34;What if-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then know I will look after them  and love and protect them as if they were my own. And let that be enough for you , your highness.&#34;</p>
