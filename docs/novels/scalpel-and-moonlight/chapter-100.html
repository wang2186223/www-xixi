                <p>And now he would never realise. He would never see and I was king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goddess I&#39;m not ready.&#34; I muttered, forcing my feet to keep moving. There was so much more I needed to learn before I took over the rule of-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the doorway I froze. My eyes glued to Megan as she leant against the wall and looked out of the window with her back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes darted from her to the kings slack eyes wide open face and back again and my eyebrows slammed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going on here?&#34; I managed to grind out. &#34;What are you doing here Megan?&#34; A niggling unease crept up my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello there lover.&#34; She turned and I was disgusted to see a wide smile on her face. &#34;I finally got to meet the king.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at him again and my chest tightened. I couldn&#39;t stand to look at him like this. I didn&#39;t want to remember the empty shell that he had become. I would remember him as the main who had raised me. A brave and solid man. A good man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s dead now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes snapped back to Megan. She was not a good person. I doubted she had ever done a good deed in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank god.&#34; She rolled her eyes. &#34;The king is dead.&#34; She lifted her voice and from the corridor behind me footsteps sounded. The heckles on the back of my neck rose. &#34;Goddess save the king.&#34; She looked me dead in the eyes as she said it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted my chin. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t be here. Leave.&#34; There were rituals I needed to perform and I couldn&#39;t do them with her in here. Ian was right. The whole kingdom was vulnerable right now and my young family were in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; She didn&#39;t sound sorry at all and she didn&#39;t make any move to leave either. &#34;Did you think I was talking to you?&#34; She cocked her head to the side and studied me like I was a bug on her shoe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind me a man stepped. Followed by others. Some I didn&#39;t know. Some I knew well. Some I had trusted with my life for years and yet here they were. But it was the man in front of them all. The man who went and stood next to Megan , a much younger woman on his arm that my eyes locked on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You?&#34; I seethed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem surprised Julian.&#34; Cassies dad said in an almost bored voice. &#34;Did you not know that my claim on this throne is stronger than yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. &#34;You aren&#39;t royal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am royal blood. Just not legitimate. I am the first born.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard. If what he was saying was true then I was related to Cassie. Closely related. How could that be possible? She was my mate and the moon goddess didn&#39;t make mistakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; Her name slipped from my lips before I could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will be hunted down for the murder of the king.&#34; Megan grinned. At my side my fists clenched. Megan had murdered the king or at least allowed our enemy in so they could do it. I hated her. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; She cackled. &#34;Why not? It wasn&#39;t like you really chose me. I knew you were playing me so I played you right back. But you will choose me Julian- when she is dead and I am thick with your child then you will have no choice but to claim me. The king promised me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never slept -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Amazing what some knock out drugs and medical knowledge can do isn&#39;t it. I&#39;ve been taking your essence for months. I miscalculated your dose the other night but the deed is done. We are going to have a baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt sick. &#34;Cassie is my mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie is an enemy of the kingdom. A king killer. She will die the moment I find her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the man who was meant to love her and paled. &#34;She&#39;s your daughter.&#34; I whispered. &#34;You&#39;re only child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing back his head he laughed. &#34;She&#39;s no child of mine. Her mother was a whore.  Do you know how tedious it was to have to raise her and see my wife&#39;s betrayal.&#34; He shook himself and lifted his head. &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter anymore. My guards are already searching the palace for her. She was here right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I shook my head, keeping my lips tight and thin. &#34;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s lying. I can smell her all over him..&#34; Megan touched his arm. Yuck. Was he sleeping with her as well. It didn&#39;t surprise me Megan would do what she had to do to have the life she thought she deserved. Even if that meant being the mistress of the fake king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both the women at his side were mistresses. Because Cassies mum was his wife still. I sent up a silent prayer that she was safe because they would come for her soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me where Cassie is, and I&#39;ll let you keep a position in this court Julian.&#34; He motioned and two men grabbed my arms and dragged me forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about.&#34; I said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make him kneel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My legs were kicked from under me and I went down hard on the carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have ways of making you talk Julian. Make this easier on yourself and restart a new life with the beautiful Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say a word. It didn&#39;t matter what torture they rained down on me. It didn&#39;t matter what they did to me. I would not betray Cassie again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I had to do was keep them busy for long enough and hope that Ian could get Cassie and my boys to safety.</p>
