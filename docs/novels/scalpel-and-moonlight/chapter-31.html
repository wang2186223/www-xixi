                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am a bully of you.&#34; Julian&#39;s voice seemed to echo in my head.  Rumbling down to vibrate through my body which trembled in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could I say to that? There was nothing to argue with him about if he was agreeing with me but goddess I wanted to. I always wanted to argue with him. He just had that kind of face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t see to be wanting to bully me now Prince Julian?&#34; I said tartly.  Pressed this closely to his body with not even a scrap of material between us I could feel every inch of his rock hard body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every single inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened slightly but he didn&#39;t say anything , he just pulled me closer. Holding me so tightly that he crushed the air out of my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hand looped around my waist , he dragged the tips of his fingers of the other down over my hip and then without warning, moving so fast that I didn&#39;t know what was happening he thrust his hand between my legs. Cupping my mound roughly. His fingers didn&#39;t dip into me but it still felt like a violation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dare he do this. Touch me like this without my permission. Wife or not we didn&#39;t live in a country where this was acceptable. Even within the wolf community we didn&#39;t force each other. Well the decent shifters didn&#39;t anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again Julian wasn&#39;t a decent anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Ducking down his lips found my jawline and moved along it. His teeth grazed my skin. &#34;I am going to bully you.&#34; Rubbing the heel of his palm right against my clit. Grinding against it in a movement that bordered on the very edge of being  painful but wasn&#39;t quite. One thick finger slid between my folds. Parting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am going to bully you but you&#39;ll enjoy it.&#34; From an inch away his eyes met mine. His sparkled with malice and something that looked very much like unbridled passion. &#34;You enjoy this don&#39;t you.&#34; Julian&#39;s lips brushed the corner of my mouth. I kept my lips tightly shut. I didnt care if he wanted to kiss me I didn&#39;t want to kiss him. The thought revolted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except it didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t enjoy you touching me.&#34; I hissed. &#34;You make me sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing back his head Julian laughed. The sound echoing around the trees. &#34;I don&#39;t make you sick Cassie. I make you,&#34; curling his hand around me , he thrust two fingers into me. As far as they would go. I cried out. Need pulsing through with me with the sudden intrusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I make you wet.&#34; He worked his fingers in and out of me. Teasing the bundle of nerves deep inside of me that caused my legs to buckle. It was only his arm wrapped that tightly around me that kept me on my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hate you.&#34; Clinging to his shoulders, I scraped my nails down his tanned skin. I did hate him. I hated him with every atom of my being but I wanted him as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; He kept working his finger inside of me. Mercilessly pushing me closer and closer to the kind of release that would have me screaming my pleasure and my hate to the sky above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I hate you as well.&#34; Harder and harder he thrust. And I was totally at his mercy. Not because I couldn&#39;t fight back. I knew he would stop if I put up enough of a fight but because I knew that&#39;s what he wanted me to do. Julian would get off on me fighting back and I wouldn&#39;t give him the satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; I trembled as every muscle in my body tensed. The orgasm crashed over me like a tsunami. Wave after wave of almost unbearable pleasure rocking me in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding his hands from between my legs he lifted me. Giving me no choice but to wrap my legs around his waist. He slammed me back against the nearest tree trunk. Bending his knees he pressed the head of his thick cock against my core. Teasing me with it but not filling me like I wanted him to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beg me to fuck you.&#34; He growled out and it was clear that he was struggling not to thrust upwards as well. Even this was a battle between us. With neither one of us wanting to admit we wanted each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was our relationship all over. Right from the second we had married and he hadn&#39;t bothered to turn up it had been war. And I wasn&#39;t going to admit defeat. Not even now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll never beg you.&#34; I bit down on his shoulder. Leaving teeth marks in his skin but not puncturing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh you will. You&#39;ll beg me anytime I want you to Cassie because I own you. Even now your body is begging for my cock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is not.&#34; I countered angrily even though I knew it was true. My body did want him to fill us completely. So we could take out our hatred for each other entwined in each other&#39;s arms with sweat dripping from our bodies. It would be tough and primal and passionate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two fingers were thrust into my mouth. The two fingers he had just had inside of me. I could taste myself on them. My juices and my release. My lips closed around them before I knew what I was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Suck them clean and I&#39;ll give you what you want.&#34; He worked them in and out of my mouthy. Almost making me gag every time he thrust them down my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even think about it. I sucked and the moment I did he pushed up into my body. Hard and so violently that my head snapped back and bounced off the tree trunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand fell away so he could pin me to the tree and his mouth crashed down over mine. His tongue thrust into my mouth in time with the punishing thrusts of his manhood into my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could do nothing  but cling to him. My back rubbed raw from the rough tree bark but the cries that tumbled from my lips weren&#39;t cries of joy pain they were moans of passion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was pain and pleasure mixed all together so I didn&#39;t know where one stopped and another started. It was a battle but this time there would be no losers. We would both win here or maybe -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe we would both lose because every time we came together I felt my resolve around him weaken a little bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to keep hating him. It was the only thing that kept me going. Marrying Julian had been the worst decision of my life. But I was trapped now. Trapped with a man who hated my guts. If I didn&#39;t keep my distance then he would break me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would never let Julian break me.  Not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching around him, I moaned loudly in his ear. Already I was close and he was as well. I could feel him throbbing  and pulsing inside of wet pussy. Growing even thicker as he raced towards the release we both so desperately wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck.&#34; He growled out. Pulling out he stepped back the second my feet hit the forest floor. Sagging backwards I watched as his cum splurted over my stomach and breasts in hot thick ropes. &#34;We wouldn&#39;t want you pregnant would we.&#34; He smirked even though he was panting and couldn&#39;t catch his breath. Reaching out he rubbed the sticky white goo into the skin of my breasts, rubbing it into my nipples. &#34;But I like the idea of you wearing my cum Cassie. Because you see.&#34; He stepped back to assses his handwork. &#34;You are mine and I will take you if I want to. I own you , I own your orgasms as well. So if I want you to cum you will and if I want to bully you,&#34; his eyes sparkled. &#34;Well you will take that as well.&#34;</p>
