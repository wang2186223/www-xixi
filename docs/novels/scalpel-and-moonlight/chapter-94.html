                <p>Julian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Ian took Cassies arm and lead her away fast and my heart thundered with the need to rip her away from him.  I couldn&#39;t be a beast around her any longer even if I wanted to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No I had to be diplomatic. Cassie had agreed to stay long enough to talk to me and try and help the king on the condition that Ian went free and I had agreed readily but truthfully if they had both wanted to leave they were free to go. I couldn&#39;t keep my mate at my side if she didn&#39;t want to be there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a way it was probably best she did leave at least for a little while. I still had enemies and I had to get rid of Megan. I had a feeling she would not be happy about vacating the position she had forced herself into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook the thought away and rushed to keep up with them. It shouldn&#39;t surprise me that Ian knew where I planned on taking them but in a way it did. Ian had just always been there. Doing his job as beta exceptionally well. But he was more than just any beta. He was skilled and wily and more capable than I had ever realised. He would have made an exceptional alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked and they seemed to disappear into the wall. Only I knew they hadn&#39;t disappeared at all. He had used to the secret door. The palace was full of secret rooms and corridors. Sound proof and magic proof. You stepped inside and you just vanished without a trace. Growing up I had been forbidden on exploring them under the threat that the bones of people lost in them would be the last thing I ever saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now as an adult I only knew of one of two rooms. Rooms like the one they had just vanished into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind me I could hear Megan&#39;s heels coming up the stairs fast. I did not want to be seen by her. It would spoil everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressed the special panel I slipped inside. And headed down a pitch black corridor. Soon enough I stepped into what looked like a giant conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A desk littered with papers, a long table surrounded by chairs. Books and shelves lined the walls apart from in one corner where a curtain swung. There were no windows here. The curtain hid something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian was at the table, pulling out a chair for Cassie to fall into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; She smiled up at him. Causing jealousy to rise up my throat again. The way she smiled at him bothered me. It was like they were now more than friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they sleeping together? That would be an insult I would not be able to forgive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even think it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced up to find Ian staring directly at me. His eyes were intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Cassie raised an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s wondering if we are sleeping together.&#34; Ian muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gross.&#34; Her lips curled and I didn&#39;t even bother to hide my smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No offence.&#34; She flicked her eyes up to Ian who was hovering over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None taken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So where are we? Shouldn&#39;t we be trying to get out now your lover is here?&#34; Cassie&#39;s eyes locked on mine. They were almost challenging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is not my lover.&#34; I retorted. &#34;And honestly this is the safest place for the both of you now. You won&#39;t be found here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced around. &#34;Where is here?&#34; She frowned and a tiny line appeared between her eyebrows. &#34;I didn&#39;t see a door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s because there isn&#39;t one.&#34; Ian answered smoothly. &#34;Welcome to the war rooms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;War rooms?&#34; She echoed slowly. &#34;We haven&#39;t been at war in-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are always at war, it just doesn&#39;t happen on a battle ground now.&#34; Ian said. &#34;But Julian is right. We are safer here then anywhere else until the coast is clear.&#34; Ian&#39;s turned towards me. &#34;You will need to get rid of her,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know and I will- I just need to talk to Cassie first.&#34; I took a step forward. And her eyes followed me nervously. She shifted in her seat. Leaning away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going to hurt you Cassie.&#34; I swore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes told me she didn&#39;t believe me. &#34;You used to enjoy hurting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You used to enjoy being hurt.&#34; I reminded her. Our marriage had never been full of love but it had always been full of passion. &#34;But I just want to know everything.&#34; She was still looking at me like I was the enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; She had suddenly gone pale. All of the colour leaving her face, like it had been drained away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; I fell to my knees in front of her. Reaching for her hands and squeezing them until she turned her face to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; She lied and everyone in the room knew she was lying. &#34;I just felt a little dizzy there for a second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you eaten today?&#34; I kept rubbing my thumb over the back of her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No she hasn&#39;t and the trek in was rough.&#34; Ian moved away from the table. &#34;I&#39;ll go and get some food and drink from the kitchens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of panic flowed across Cassies face. &#34;You&#39;re leaving me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached down and touched her shoulder. &#34;I won&#39;t be long. And Julian won&#39;t hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to agree with him but I knew she wouldn&#39;t believe me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get caught.&#34; I smiled at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t when I was a kid. I&#39;m not about to now. I&#39;ll be back soon. You guys-&#34; his eyes darted between us. &#34;Talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left quickly and I watched Cassies face as she watched him go with her mouth open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well-&#34; she finally sighed and her eyes found mine. &#34;Um-&#34; she bit her lip. &#34;You look well.&#34; She finished politely and I laughed. She was being so restrained , like we were strangers and maybe in a way we were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had to get to know each other for real this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you look beautiful.&#34; I added bringing her hands to my lips. I kissed each one in turn. &#34;Now shall we finally talk?&#34;</p>
