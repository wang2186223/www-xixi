                <p>&#34;It&#39;s positive.&#34; The pharmacist beamed at me. As she pushed across the little envelope with my results in. &#34;Congratulations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say a word, I knew my mouth was open and gaping in shock. &#34;There must be some kind of mistake.&#34; I finally muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean there&#39;s always a chance but-&#34; The pharmacist lowered her voice even though the small one site pharmacy was empty apart from a woman in a white coat who was at the back end of the shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has to be a mistake.&#34; I muttered again but deep down I knew there wasn&#39;t. Not that it made it any easier to swallow. I had taken the contraceptive. This shouldn&#39;t be happening.  The chances of it happening were so miniscule that I hadn&#39;t even thought it was a possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a problem here?&#34; The lady in the white coat sidled up to me. Her face sympathetic as she glanced down at the envelope in my hand and then at my white face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost my dear.&#34; She patted my arm. &#34;Was this not the news you were hoping for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head mutely. This was in fact the worst possible news at the worst possible time, I&#39;d just got my job here and already it was being threatened and then there was the small problem of who the father was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell would Julian say? What would he do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was careful. I took-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; Another comforting pat on my arm. &#34;Well sometimes there are faulse positives. Do you want me to scan you quickly and then we can see one way or another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted my eyes to her. &#34;You would do that for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, a warm smile on her face. &#34;Clinic is over and you look like you need answers so I would be happy to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fresh wave of nausea rushed up my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And a prescription for anti sickness drugs I think.&#34; She nodded to the pharmacist who nodded back. &#34;Can you arrange that for us and bring it next door?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on lovely.&#34; A warm arm was placed around my shoulders. &#34;Are you a patient here or-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My first day.&#34; I managed to mutter. &#34;Probably going to be my last day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now don&#39;t be silly.&#34; A key was placed into a lock and she stepped through. Pulling me with her, flicking on lights as she went.  &#34;Having a baby doesn&#39;t mean the end of your career. Take a seat up on the table and get comfortable. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on.&#34; She moved confidently around the room. &#34;When was your last period?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did what she asked but i didn&#39;t say anything. It might not be the end of a normal woman&#39;s career but I wasn&#39;t a normal woman. I was the wife of the crown prince and I hadn&#39;t had a period since before we had married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been with another man in that time. Of course I&#39;d been with Julian as well but he had never emptied himself inside of me. The chances of the baby if I was pregnant being Julian&#39;s were slim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then again the chances of being pregnant after I had taken the vial should also be slim,but here we were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian was going to murder me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is going to be cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glob of freezing gel was squeezed onto my stomach and then something hard pressed into my skin. Gliding over with the help of the goo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you&#39;re definitely pregnant. About two months or so.&#34; The screen was moved so I could see what was happening in my body and my eyes fixed on the bean shaped things that took up half the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was another one right next to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that-&#34; I couldn&#39;t speak or breathe or move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s two yes. Twins and both have healthy heartbeats. Let me just check a few things and then we can get you a picture or two printed out. I am sure your boyfriend or husband is going to want to see this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; I couldn&#39;t take my eyes away from the screen. Two? I was pregnant with twins and I was two months along already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My husband would definitely have a lot to say about this sudden turn of events if he found out. In fact he would probably have me banished or executed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was Cassie hiding now? Frowning I watched as she moved out of OB/GYN wing and back towards the locker room with a brown envelope clutched to her chest. She looked pale but better than she had in the bathroom but that still didn&#39;t answer why she was in that part of the hospital just before her shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had to scrub in soon and-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh hey.&#34; She turned like she had heard or maybe felt me walking behind her. &#34;I didn&#39;t expect to see you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was just grabbing a sandwich before the shift starts.&#34; I lied rubbing my stomach as if that proved I had just eaten. &#34;Where have you been?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to grab some things from the pharmacy for this stomach flu.&#34; Cassie pushed into the locker room and went straight to her locker. The envelope disappeared inside and my eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was such a liar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you feeling better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood drained from Cassie&#39;s face but she nodded her head. &#34;Much thank you. I think I&#39;ll be back to normal after a shower.&#34; Gathering up her scrubs she slammed the door to her locker shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure that you will.&#34; Turning to my own locker I began to pull everything I needed out but the moment I heard the water from the shower start it was her locker I opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The envelope was right there and my fingers trembled as I ripped it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pregnancy test was the first thing I saw. A positive one and then a little pile of photos. Each showing a-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sickness rolled my stomach. Thrusting them back in I slammed the door closed and fell onto the wooden bench. My head in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey are you ok?&#34; Cassie asked. Her shower had been super quick and I&#39;d almost been caught but I&#39;d seen enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too much actually because this was going to ruin all of my plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every single one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a headache.&#34; I forced myself to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I hope I haven&#39;t given you what I have.&#34; She said sweetly and I wanted to smash my fists in to her face like I had done last night. I was already regretting stopping. I should have killed her and left her body in the woods. No one would have suspected me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I don&#39;t think so.&#34; Forcing myself to my feet I glared at her. If I had what she had then Julian would be mine and there would be nothing anyone could do about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted Julian&#39;s baby in my belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no, it had to be Cassie. All the good things happened to Saint Cassie. The wolf who could do no wrong. It made me sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made me sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I hated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well tonight&#39;s your first shift. Are you nervous? It&#39;s a lot busier here than where we were before.&#34; I ground out between my teeth but my smile didn&#39;t slip once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am a little nervous, yeah. But I&#39;ve wanted this for so long.&#34; Cassie gave a  little shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had every reason to be nervous, especially around me but I didn&#39;t say that. Instead I smiled wider. &#34;Well you don&#39;t need to worry, Cassie. I&#39;ll take good care of you.&#34;</p>
