                <p>Julian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting my hand I rapped my knuckles against her closed door again. It was the fourt time I had knocked and the fourth time she had ignored me. I knew she was in here because I had seen her arrive home and where else would she be? She always disappeared into her room if I was gone as well. It was like she thought it would keep her safe from me. It wouldn&#39;t. It would take more than a door to keep her from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know why I was here. To apologise? That didn&#39;t sound like me at all. To tease her and goad her a little more? A cruel grin spread across my face. Now that did sound like me. And in that case I didn&#39;t need to knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I owned this house just like I owned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching down I twisted the knob and stepped into her private sanctuary and she had made it her own. There was little pieces of her personality everywhere. A framed picture here, a trinket here. If I looked hard enough I could piece together her whole life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wasn&#39;t going to do that. My eyes found the closed bathroom door and instantly I felt myself harden against my zipper. She was in there naked and soapy. I could hear the shower easily. Just like I could picture how good her body would look wet and covered in suds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my bottom lip to stop myself from groaning. Goddess I wanted her. Even when I hated her I wanted her and tonight I wanted her more than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would she do if I stepped into that shower with her. My hand moving between her legs to see how wet she was for me. Cassie could tell me she hated me and the feeling was mutual but she wanted me as well. It was like an invisible string that tied us together in hate and passion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My need for her was so strong that I had taken two steps towards the closed bathroom door before I knew what I was doing and it was only then that I saw the open laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, I turned towards it fully. She had been talking to someone. It looked like some kind of chat room. Picking it up I held it with one hand and scrolled through the chat with the other and the more I read the angrier I became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck no.&#34; The words left my mouth is a rumbling growl. Did Cassie have so little respect for me that she thought I would allow her to talk like this to another man. Because it was clear she had been talking about sex with a complete stranger on the internet and very recently at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she that horny or was this another way my wife thought she could humiliate me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way I wouldn&#39;t stand for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you doing in here?&#34; Cassie&#39;s voice was startled and I turned to her so quickly that I almost dropped her laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes moved across the scrap of cloth that was a towel but barely covered her before landing on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cock hardened even more. Arousal and need mixing with the anger I was feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my house Cassie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s your house but this is my room.&#34; She kept her distance and that was probably for the best because in the mood I was in I didn&#39;t know whether I wanted to rip that towel off and throw her down on the bed or rip it off and pull her over my knee to spank her until her ass was red and she was crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either one sounded good to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t just come in here whenever you want to.&#34; She continued. Her eyes flashing. &#34;It&#39;s not polite. Sometimes I wonder if you have any manners at all.&#34; Her lips curled in a sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a fine one to talk about manners and politeness.&#34; I lifted the laptop a little higher and her eyes bugged out of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing with that? Give that to me. It&#39;s private.&#34; She made a snatch for it and I moved a step away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can see that ,Cassie. Is this what you do in your spare time? Sex talk with strangers on the internet? Is that why you don&#39;t want me here in your room? Are you afraid of what I&#39;ll interrupt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks flamed red and my eyes narrowed in on her face. They hadn&#39;t flamed red at all; they were red. Like she had hurt herself. Or someone had hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did something-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out Julian.&#34; She screamed it at me and any worry I had for wellbeing disappeared. Why did she always have to make it so hard?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Do you need to get back to your online lover?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a consultation. A paid consultation as a doctor. I was just doing my job and helping people. I wouldn&#39;t expect you to understand that. Because there&#39;s no cure for what you have.&#34; Cassie&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;Maybe I can help you though. Do you find it hard to get it up? Want me to prescribe-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roared before she finished and surged forward but she was quicker. With a wicked laugh she grabbed the laptop out of my hands and disappeared into the bathroom again. The door locked and slammed behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear to the goddess Cassie I am going to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was I going to do? Break the door down and punish her. I wanted to but I wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my pocket my phone began to ring. The ringtone was the one I had for Ian. And he would only be calling at this time of night if it was important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Answering the call I pressed my phone between my cheek and my shoulder and slapped the bathe room door with my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Saved by the bell Cassie but this isn&#39;t over. Not by a long shot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I interrupting another lovers spat?&#34; Ian&#39;s voice laughed down the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Because we aren&#39;t lovers. What&#39;s wrong? Has something happened?&#34; Moving down the dark corridors I headed towards my own room. I would leave Cassie alone tonight but only because she would be expecting me and I wanted to take her by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever you say alpha. It&#39;s not like any of us have eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to ask what he meant by that so I kept silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But talking about lovers. I&#39;ve just been on the phone to megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan?&#34; At first I didn&#39;t know who he was talking about. &#34;Oh her.&#34; It was bad that I didn&#39;t remember her when he mentioned her name because I had slept with her. &#34;What does she want? More money?&#34; I remembered giving her money for a sick family member clearly though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Ian&#39;s voice was even and emotionless. &#34;She wants you to help one of her friends get a job at the royal hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. I had helped megan , but did she really expect me to help every person she knew to get a better job?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why would I do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian&#39;s chuckle was laced with sarcasm. &#34;I am so glad you asked Julian because her good friend is named Cassie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air left my lungs in a whoosh. Megan was trying to get my wife a job? Why? I had so many questions and no way of getting answers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know they were such good friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me neither but I guess it makes sense.&#34; Ian said quietly. &#34;I mean they worked together so they would be bound to know each other right? What do you want me to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated but only for a minute. &#34;Find Cassie a job there .&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to do my wife any favours but I didn&#39;t want her on the internet talking to men about their erections either.  So this was a compromise I was willing to make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Megan?&#34; Ian asked. &#34;She wants to see you. She&#39;s left you messages. What would you like me to tell her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Women. I rolled my eyes. All these women and they all wanted to use me for something. I had thought megan was no different to the rest but now I wasn&#39;t so sure. Maybe she wasn&#39;t so bad after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. Tell her nothing. I am too tired to deal with more emotionally needy women tonight. I&#39;ll answer her messages when I see fit.&#34;</p>
