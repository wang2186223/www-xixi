                <p>I shifted away from Megan&#39;s bedside as a sudden wave of unease flooded my body. It prickled through my senses , making the hairs all of my body stand on end. Suddenly I was on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly I wanted to be away from Megan and her needy eyes and grabby hands. I&#39;d had a similar feeling about 15 minutes ago but it has quickly passed. This time it was different and getting stronger by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what it was but-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fresh wave of something washed over my body , and with it the sweetest scent I had ever smelt. Only that wasn&#39;t true I had smelt it before. Many months ago in a hospital like this one when a woman had saved my life and made love to me without me even seeing her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was here. And so close that the smell of her tickled every one of my senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Megan. Maybe she was the one after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just at that moment the door opened and Forrest appeared. A white coat over his thick woollen jumper but I barely acknowledged him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie stepped in behind him. A strained smile on her face. Her eyes were red like she had been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Megan.&#34; Forrest nodded his head at the woman in the bed behind me first. &#34;You&#39;re highness. You shouldn&#39;t be out of bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring him I turned to my wife fully. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34; I demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment she lifted her head and met my eyes and there was a flash of anger in the words of hers. She blinked and it disappeared in a second but I knew what I had seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard the news and wanted to make sure you were ok.&#34; She dropped her eyes to her feet and scuffed one of them back and forth on the tile floor. &#34;I can leave if you like and wait for-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forrest?&#34; I finished for her. Side eying the doctor who was talking to Megan in a hushed voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is your driver, Cassie?&#34; I lowered my voice to a growl. But I already knew the answer to that. She has given him the slip. Which shouldn&#39;t surprise me at all. &#34;God you make me crazy.&#34; I hissed making a grab for her arm I dragged her closer to my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goddess she drove me insane.  No other woman in the history of our kind had ever made me madder. One look and Cassie could get under my skin and make me rage. Half the time I didn&#39;t even know whether I wanted to choke her or fuck her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the time it was both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of need flowed through me and my grip on my wife tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie gave a little cry of protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re highness.&#34; Forrest&#39;s voice was sharp. A stark reminder that we aren&#39;t alone and I couldn&#39;t do what I wanted with my wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus Megan was watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guiltily I stepped back and glanced at the woman who had just lost my child. I had promised to look after her and I was a man of my word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had made promises to my wife as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my head I stepped back again, glancing between them. The scent of my mate was gone now. But I knew what I had smelt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been so close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes fell on Megan and I smiled an apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right I forgot myself in my pain. My apologies Cassie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t look at me, she just stood there with he arms wrapped around her middle and her eyes glued to the tile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like she was afraid to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s ok.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. She was being too submissive. Too quiet and very unlike herself. Something was going on with her and I didn&#39;t like it. It felt like she was afraid of me and cassie wasn&#39;t afraid of anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless- only last night she had been kidnapped and assaulted. Of course she was scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for coming.&#34; I said quietly. &#34;It means a lot-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sob ripped its way from Megan&#39;s throat and I turned to her instantly. Moving around Forrest I perched on the edge of the bed and took her hand in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter how much I was infuriated by Cassie, Megan had to be my priority now. She had been the one carrying my kid after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would like some time with Megan now.&#34; I met Cassies eyes and watched for a reaction. She didn&#39;t give any.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No surprise and no jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was expecting at least jealousy but Cassies face showed absolutely no emotion at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how I felt about that. I liked torturing her. It was fun and -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips curled up in a smile as a cruel idea took root in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; She nodded her head in submission.  &#34;I&#39;ll wait outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Outside the door please Cassie.&#34; I ordered. &#34;Until your drive arrives to take you home where you wil stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was I being cruel to her? Why did I enjoy it so much. I could feel Megan&#39;s happiness as well. Why did we all like making Cassiea life hell so much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forrest can take me home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No he can&#39;t. I need my doctor here.&#34; I snapped back. &#34;He needs to prepare for my discharge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Discharge your highness?&#34; Forrest sounded confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; I kept my eyes on my wife , gauging her reaction. &#34;I need to go home , so I can get everything prepared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Prepared for what?&#34; This time it was Cassie who spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For Megan to come and live with me.&#34; I grinned and my grin only grew as the first flicker of surprise and horror tightened Cassies face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your highness.&#34; Forrest stepped between us almost like he wanted to protect her from me. Which was stupid because as big and muscled as he was , Forrest was no match for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You both need to be in hospital. With expert medical care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing back my head I laughed even though it caused agony to rip through me. &#34;But we will have expert care. Cassie can be our Doctor.&#34;</p>
