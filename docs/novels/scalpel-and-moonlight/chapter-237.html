                <p>The boys were fluffy pups trying to be big bad wolves and it was adorable. With their glistening little canines and the feeble growls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I wasn&#39;t the only one to think so. All the giant black cats thought so. I had caught them one purr in their direction or gentle nudge them with their massive heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually having such dangerous creatures next to my defenceless sons when I couldn&#39;t muster my wolf to protect them would have filled me with panic but for some reason this didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The giant cats of Yannas family were now my boys family as well and anyway Ian was going to run with them as well and I knew he would never let anything happen to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus Niall and Noah needed this. They desperately needed their own kind around them. It was the only way they would ever learn to control the animal side of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you won&#39;t come?&#34; Ian asked , almost his entire body on display because he was only wearing shorts. And pretty skimpy shorts at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I understood the reason he was wearing them because when he shifted his wolf would rip his clothes to shreds but it showed more of his body off than I was comfortable seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not because Ian didn&#39;t have the body of a Greek god but because I had noticed that he had a great body and that was dangerous ground for a woman who was as lonely as me. Especially when we shared a bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never looked at Ian as anything but a friend before and I didn&#39;t want to start now. Plus he was destined to be with Yanna. I believed that with my whole heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head and smiled up at him. &#34;No wolf, she&#39;s sleeping and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyebrows slammed down. &#34;You could walk with us. Me and the boys will walk with you. They aren&#39;t going to be able to keep up with everyone anyway. It&#39;s more the fact they get the chance to be a part of this-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching up on my tiptoes I pressed my lips to his cheek and silenced him. Ian&#39;s eyes widened in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I shook my head but my words were firm. &#34;Take the boys and have fun. I know you and Yanna will protect them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darted towards the naked back of Yanna as she laughed at something one of her people were saying. &#34;And who is going to protect me from her?&#34; He countered in a deadly serious voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does she frighten you that much?&#34; I teased and he shrugged but didn&#39;t answer. Really he didn&#39;t have to. I could see she did but she intrigued him just as much. He wouldn&#39;t want to admit it but there was lust there as well. An attraction he was fighting tooth and claw not to feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; He said flatly before he threw his head back and laughed. &#34;But I think I&#39;ll survive as long as I don&#39;t talk or even look in her direction.&#34; He turned his full attention on me.  &#34;It&#39;s fine that you don&#39;t want to come but what are you going to do? We will be gone a few hours at least.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrugging I glanced around. &#34;I thought I might make sure all the food is ready and then maybe read on the porch. It&#39;s peaceful here.&#34; My voice turned wistful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment he just stared at me and then he nodded. &#34;Please don&#39;t wander off though.&#34; His words were clipped as the moon sprang out of the clouds overhead. His whole body trembled with the appearance of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to shift and run after so long trapped in his human skin. Reaching out I gave him a little push. &#34;Go and have fun. Please don&#39;t lose my pups.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t.&#34; Not bothering to look back he joined the mass of muscular back bodies and shifted. His wolf huge and shaggy in comparison and then they were gone. My boys between him and Yannas sleek cat. I watched them prance between the trees before turning back to the lodge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t go inside though. I knew I had said I was going to help with the food but I also knew that the elderly shifters didn&#39;t need my help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would only get in the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead I found one of the carved wooden seats that dotted the wrap around porch and pulled out my phone. It wasng as easy to navigate the doctors website on it compared to my laptop but that was at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I expected to see no one on my wait list so I was surprised to find one name there. Except it wasn&#39;t a name. It was a jumble of numbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Numbers that just so happened to be my birthday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With trembling fingers I accepted the consultation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three dots appeared before I had even began to type.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for talking to me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the typed words. My fingers frozen. In my chest my heart slammed against my ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was him again. The one I had slammed the laptop shut on before. He was here and waiting for me and I knew why because I knew who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart told me. Just like it was my heart that told me to open the app and see. Even with my rejection happening, he still called to me across the miles and like a weak fool I was powerless to do anything but go to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t end the session Cassie. I just want to talk to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still couldn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s you Cassie and I know you don&#39;t want to be found.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dot dot dot as he typed even more and I still couldn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to make sure you are ok. We need to talk. I need you to understand.&#34; I could almost hear him sigh even though that was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t Julian.&#34; I typed out quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes you can. Please Cassie, just let me explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A noise from behind me made me whirl. Goddess I was a fool to even be doing this. I knew it. Just like I knew this was going to break my heart all over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow at ten in the morning.&#34; My fingers rushed over the small keypad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34; His answer was instant,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then I closed the app and shoved the phone into my pocket. Cursing myself for my weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because when it came to Julian it didn&#39;t matter what I told myself. I was the weakest creature in the pack.</p>
