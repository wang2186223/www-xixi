                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what to do or where to turn. I was in an impossible situation with a man who I was tied to but had decided to leave me the morning after my abduction to meet his mistress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same mistress who had tried to kill my babies only a few days ago. It didn&#39;t matter to me that Julian didn&#39;t know all those details. He had still chosen her over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would always choose her and that was something I had to come to terms with. One thing was for certain though I couldn&#39;t stay with him. Not not. It would kill me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to break my vow and the contract I had made with the King but I couldn&#39;t stay either. If I had to I would work three jobs and pay every penny back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just needed out of my sham of a marriage first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that meant I needed somewhere for me and my mum to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somewhere cheap and cheerful for now. We didn&#39;t need anything lavish and it needed to be-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked and the car park came back into view below me. It was raining and I didn&#39;t know when that had started. How much time had passed since my husband had come to pick up his mistress? I didn&#39;t know. I had lost all track of time but I knew it must have been a while because now I wasn&#39;t lost in my own thoughts , the muscles in my legs and back were cramped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking myself , I rolled my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to find somewhere to live that wasn&#39;t anywhere around here. Julian might not want me to be his wife but he would never let me go either. It would be too embarrassing for him. And that meant I needed to run far far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With little money and an extremely ill mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I couldn&#39;t even do an internet search for properties because I knew Julian would be able to see. I had a bodyguard and driver now, they would relay everything I did and everyone I spoke to. Julian was probably tracking my internet usage as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded like something he would do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It left me with very few options.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sucking my bottom lip into my mouth I chewed on it thoughtfully. Who could I go to for help? It wasn&#39;t like I had many friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even less that knew my situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without meaning to I dropped my hands to my stomach. I wasn&#39;t just doing this for me and my mum. I was doing it for my babies as well. The two little lives I was growing deep inside of my body. They were innocent in all of this but I knew Julian. He wouldn&#39;t accept them and he could be brutal when he wanted to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than anything else I needed to get them away from him and the life he would force them to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the only person I could ask. The only person who knew everything. Forrest had helped me in the past, more than once. Maybe I could beg him for his help to find somewhere to live. Even if it was to use the computer in his office to search for somewhere to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would help me. I knew he would but if he didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t know what I was going to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Digging into my bag I pulled out my phone and dialed out his number. He would be at work but I didn&#39;t want to just turn up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered on the third ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; He was breathing heavily. Like he had been running. &#34;What&#39;s happened, are you ok?&#34; There was a sound of a door opening and then crashing shut behind him. &#34;I heard about what happened and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure? Where are you? Is someone-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut him off again. &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; I glanced around because I didn&#39;t want anyone to overhear me. This was a conversation I wanted to have in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I&#39;m not but I&#39;m safe right now.&#34; Another glance around. My eyes narrowed. People walked passed me without even glancing in my direction but that didn&#39;t mean anything. Any one of them could be a Julian spy or a Megan supporter. I didn&#39;t know who my enemies were anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I didn&#39;t know when I had become so paranoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we meet somewhere?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed. &#34;What&#39;s happened Cassie? You should be at home. Resting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine honestly and nothing new has happened. I just-&#34; I paused and took a deep breath. &#34;I need to ask you a favour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forrest was silent. He was going to start to believe the only time I rang him was when I needed something and I didn&#39;t want that. Forrest was my friend and I loved him like a brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing big,&#34; I stuttered when he remained silent. &#34;Just a tiny thing and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sigh was loud. &#34;You know I would do anything for you Cassie. Big or small. So tell me where you are and we can chat in person. It&#39;s probably safer that way.&#34; He chuckled mirthlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m visiting my mum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well you are in luck because I am where you are for a change. I had a patient come in here with an emergency and was checking on them. But that&#39;s not what you want to hear and I am all done now. Shall we grab a coffee? Neither one of us have an office here anymore.&#34; Another laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went back to chewing my lip. As much as coffee sounded good. I wasn&#39;t sure caffeine was good for the babies and I didn&#39;t want to have to look over my shoulder to see if anyone was listening in if we met in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know the small staff only cafeteria in the basement?&#34; Forrest asked like he had read my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; I did know it but I had forgotten. But it was the perfect place. &#34;I&#39;ll meet you there in a few minutes.&#34;</p>
