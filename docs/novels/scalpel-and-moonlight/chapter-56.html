                <p>The sounds of wet flesh and cries of agony filled my ears before we were even down the stairs. But it was the rage in Julian&#39;s cries that was deafening. He was so angry. Angrier than I had ever seen anyone before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is he so mad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian paused for a second. Staring at me like I was simple. &#34;Why do you think Cassie.&#34; He said softly. &#34;Hey what&#39;s wrong?&#34; He tightened his grip on me as I swayed where I stood. The world around me felt weird , like I wasn&#39;t a part of it anymore. Everything felt disjointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything but the pain which ripped through my lower abdomen. Doubling over I gasped clutching at myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My knees buckled and my legs gave way. Ian caught me easily. Lifting me into the waiting back seat of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hurt?&#34; Leaning inside he looked me over. &#34;You said you weren&#39;t but there&#39;s so much blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head , my eyes watering with the pain. &#34;No.&#34; I managed to croak out. &#34;It&#39;s not my blood. I&#39;m fine.&#34; I lied because something was definitely not fine. My stomach felt like it was being squeezed in a vice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic filled me and made a fresh sob rip its way from my lips. I curled my legs up into my chin and wrapped my arms around myself. Rocking slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was I having a miscarriage? Was that what this was?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; I screwed my eyes shut. If I was having a miscarriage then I had to deal with it on my own. No one could know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the moment Julian was being sweet and caring and I needed that right now. If he found out I was pregnant then all of that would change and I didn&#39;t want to be alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really really didn&#39;t want to be alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost like magic Julian appeared. Sliding naked into the car. The instant the door slammed shut behind him he pulled me into his arms. Physically pulling me on to his lap so he could cradle me in his arms as the car pulled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What-&#34; I began to say and he pressed my cheek into his chest. Holding me to him. I could feel the pounding of his heart against my skin. It was soothing. Just like the arms he held tightly around me were soothing. I nuzzled in closer and the pain in my tummy eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never have to worry about him hurting you again Cassie.&#34; He murmured. His voice a gentle whisper. &#34;It&#39;s over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You killed him.&#34; It wasn&#39;t a question, it was a statement. I already knew he had. The sounds that had followed me from that room had been so wet, so full of rage and hatred that death was the only way it would have ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know this situation between us is contractual Cassie.&#34; Julian sighed heavily. &#34;But you are still my wife and that means no man gets to touch you,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We fell into silence. I knew his words were meant to put me at ease but they hurt my heart so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A contract was all that kept us together and it was starting to kill me. Just one flimsy peace of paper. It seemed such a fragile thing to build a life on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We didn&#39;t speak again for the rest of the car journey. We just held each other in silence and for the time being it was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have drifted off because when I opened my eyes next we were home. In the dark hands slid around my body and for a moment I fought against the grip on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just me Cassie. We are home.&#34; Easily Julian lifted me into his arms and cradling me like a baby carried me inside the sprawling mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cathy stood just inside the softly lit doorway. Her hands wringing together in worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the young mistress alright?&#34; Tears made the older woman&#39;s voice thick. &#34;Oh Cassie.&#34; She cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you do what I asked?&#34; Julian swept passed her and headed up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes master.&#34; She said quickly. &#34;There&#39;s also tea and some sandwiches. So she can keep her strength up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian didn&#39;t thank her as he stomped up the stairs and I bit back a groan. Sometimes he really could be an ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Cathy.&#34; I called down weakly to her because one of us had to have manners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving through the quiet house Julian carried me like I weighed nothing at all. Into my room and then into the adjoining bathroom. Which was filled with the sweetest smelling steam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Easing me down onto my feet he turned me towards the bath and I knew that he&#39;d asked Cathy to run it for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I whispered shrugging out of the jacket that he had wrapped me in when he had rescued me.  It fell to the floor and for a second we both just stood there and stared at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will give you some privacy.&#34; He stepped away, turning his face so he could avert his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t go.&#34; Reaching out I snagged his wrist. Julian froze , turning slowly to stare at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay?&#34; I begged. &#34;Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a solid minute he stared at me , and I could see the turmoil in his face, then he nodded. &#34;Climb in and I&#39;ll help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did what he asked. And the hot water both eased my aching tense muscles and scolded my skin all at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Climbing in behind me, Julian wrapped his arms around me. Pulling me back against the hardness of his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ok?&#34; He asked softly. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I admitted in a croak because my voice was breaking. &#34;But I will be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there it was the absolute truth. Right now I felt broken beyond repair but that was just a feeling. I knew I would get over tonight. I just needed to give myself time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lean forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wha-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just lean forward Cassie, I want to wash your hair for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was such a simple request but probably the sweetest thing he had ever said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as he soaped up my hair , lathering and rinsing and massaging my scalp with his fingers I felt my fears for the future slide away with the suds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all going to be alright. I knew that deep down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end everything was going to be alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twisting my body I stared into his eyes and he stared into mine. His fingers tracing my cheek in a gentle sweep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kiss me.&#34; I murmured.</p>
