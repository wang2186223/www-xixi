                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not powerful.&#34; I muttered. &#34;I have a little magic from the Lycan blood in me but it&#39;s nothing dangerous. A little healing.&#34; I stumbled over my own words. My eyes glued to the scarred wood of the table. I didn&#39;t want to look at anyone in this room and see the accusations in their eyes because that&#39;s what I would see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were going to blame me for what was happening to everyone , like somehow I was responsible for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I wasn&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t be and I was sick and tired of being blamed for things that were out of my control. I was sick and tired of being blamed for mistakes men had made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly I lifted my chin and with it my shoulders straightened. Julian and Ian were right. I was queen. &#34;I am not to blame for what is happening here.&#34; I said firmly and several pairs of eyes darted away from my anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one said you are to blame Cassie.&#34; Under the table Julian let go of my hand and squeezed my knee instead. &#34;No one here is ever going to blame you for anything ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The feel of his fingers , rough against my skin, was distracting. But then that&#39;s why he was doing it. To try and take my mind off of things. Part of me wanted that. Wanted to think about other things , like his big hands caressing me but-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved my leg away and shook my head. The time for acting like the damsel in distress was over. And I wouldn&#39;t let Julian take my mind off of things. Even if I desperately wanted him to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are to be protected at all costs.&#34; Julian lifted his eyes to me beseechingly. &#34;That&#39;s what we are saying. That you are special in a way that we haven&#39;t worked out yet and that Duncan-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Duncan will keep coming after you.&#34; Scarlett said with a firm nod of her head. &#34;So we must keep you safe. I&#39;ll double the guards in the pack house now you are both staying here and maybe -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; My chair scraped back as I stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No my love?&#34; Julian reached for my hand and again I moved away from it but flashed him a smile. I didn&#39;t want him to think I was angry at him because I wasn&#39;t. I was angry at this whole situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to keep you safe.&#34; Ian added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And no amount of guards is going to do that.&#34; I spat. Why couldn&#39;t they get it. Whatever was happening to us couldn&#39;t be fought with extra guards at the door. If they were right and this thing was after me then I had to be able to protect myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both mentally and physically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you will excuse me.&#34; I inclined my head to the table politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going Cassie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to my husband. &#34;To train. I need to be able to defend myself and I am no use here. Once I have trained a little then I will go to the infirmary and try to help.&#34; Bending down I kissed his cheek. &#34;I want to help and feel useful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian&#39;s eyes locked with mine and it looked like he was going to argue with me and then he nodded his head. &#34;Be careful.&#34; He said instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew he wasn&#39;t telling me to be careful at training because he knew deep down that that wasn&#39;t where I was going to go. I needed answers, we both did and we wouldn&#39;t get them in this never ending meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll meet you in the training building in two hours.&#34; His eyes met mine unblinking. That&#39;s how long he was giving me to snoop around. How long he would be keeping everyone busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll look forward to it.&#34; I swept away, rushing from the room and closing the door softly behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;M&#39;lady?&#34; Kips voice took me by surprise and I whirled around, clutching at my throat. It was wierd because for a second it was like he had just appeared out of nowhere and I hadn&#39;t recognised him at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later and the confusion disappeared. &#34;Kip.&#34; I rushed forward and hugged him. &#34;Where have you been?&#34; I asked as he cuddled me back awkwardly. &#34;It&#39;s been days since I saw you , I thought-&#34; I trailed off with a frown. I don&#39;t know what I had thought? That he had disappeared? That he had winked out of existence like Yanna? I didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here now.&#34; He untangled himself from my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where were you?&#34; I searched his narrow adolescent face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know- &#34; he began to say and then shook himself. &#34;I guess I got caught up in something my queen but I am back now and ready to serve you.&#34; He gave a small bow and I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get out of here.&#34; I looped my arm through his and began walking.  The way I treated him wasn&#39;t very queenly but I just didn&#39;t care. Kip had come into my life when I had needed someone who would not act like I was royalty. I had needed a true friend , someone who had my back and that I could look after in return and the goddess had given me Kip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Training?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused , turning to him. &#34;How did you know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was you listening in at the door?&#34; I asked my voice full of shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe a little. I would have thought Ian would have come with you if you wanted to train.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, dragging him away from the door and anyone on the other side that might be listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ian can&#39;t be involved in this.&#34; I whispered hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I&#39;m not training. I&#39;m on the hunt for information. Secret hidden information that Scarlett has locked away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyebrows shot up. &#34;We are going to try and break into my alphas personal things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, expecting him to say no. &#34;You don&#39;t have to come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I&#39;m coming with you my queen. You need me , I am excellent and picking locks and finding out secrets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was my turn to look shocked. &#34;You are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded and walked away. Leaving me to stare at his back. The goddess had really come through for me when she had put Kip in my path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to be everything I ever needed whenever I needed it.</p>
