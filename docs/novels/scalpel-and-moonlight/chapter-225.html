                <p>Three days, it had been three days and I hadn&#39;t heard a peep from either Cassie or Ian. When I called their phones went straight to voice mail. Every hotel in the city didn&#39;t know what I was talking about. So I knew they weren&#39;t there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like my wife and children had disappeared into thin air and it was beginning to worry me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than worry me, it filled me with an ice cold dread that I couldn&#39;t shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My only relief was that I knew they hadn&#39;t been kidnapped. If they had been then there would have been a ransom by now or we would have found their bodies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand closed around the windowsill at the thoughts of their bodies, my children so small and innocent and my wife curled around them in a last ditch effort to keep them safe assaulted me. I could see it all so clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would fight tooth and nail to protect them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They aren&#39;t dead.&#34; I whispered to myself. It was my favourite mantra. One that I repeated over and over again. &#34;Ian is with them. He has them hidden and safe and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your highness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fell silent, turning to Cathy with a small weary small. &#34;Is there any news?&#34; She asked quietly. &#34;I don&#39;t mean to intrude but the staff wanted me to ask you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My smile slipped a second before I forced it back on to my face. &#34;Not yet-&#34; I trailed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cathy&#39;s brow furrowed. Keeping her head down she moved into the room and closed the door softly behind her. My eyebrows shot up in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your highness-&#34; she stuttered. &#34;Julian.&#34; Her eyes pleaded for me to understand something I clearly didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to overstep but this thing with Megan,&#34; she shook her head. &#34;There are rumours that she is.&#34; Her throat worked as she swallowed hard. &#34;Forgive me.&#34; She added quickly. &#34;But there are rumours that Megan is carrying your child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rage that bubbled up in my chest was all consuming and I had to swallow it down before it erupted. Cathy didn&#39;t deserve my anger, none of the staff did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; She turned her head away. Clearly trying to hide her disgust at me. &#34;Then the rumours are true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained silent. Yes Megan was pregnant. I had double checked that myself but the child wasn&#39;t mine. I knew that I had never touched her. Not once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure back when I had first been married I had thought I had but that was because I had gotten Cassie and Megan mixed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mixing them up now. My heart and soul knew Cassie was my love and my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long have these rumours been flying around the kitchen?&#34; I asked, my voice clipped with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A few days. I tried to squash them-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut her off with a growl. &#34;I clearly aren&#39;t giving everyone enough work if you all have time to gossip about my personal life,Cathy. Honestly I&#39;m disappointed at you and the others. How dare you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cathy&#39;s old head snapped upwards and her eyes were challenging. &#34;How dare we?&#34; She asked in a small voice. &#34;How dare you Julian? Sometimes I look at you and I see the man you were destined to be but most of the time I see a weak man. A man who I am ashamed of. I have known you since you were a boy so I have earned the right to speak openly to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes flashed and a growl rumbled through my chest. Only this time she didn&#39;t look away. She met my gaze unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am glad your mother isn&#39;t here to see the kind of man you have become Julian.&#34; She spat and I had never heard such venom in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reeled back in shock but she didn&#39;t let me get a word in. Hands on her hips she glared at me. &#34;She would be ashamed of you. You are meant to love and protect your family and not go and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do love my family.&#34; I snapped back. I was so fed up with people questioning that. I loved Cassie and the boys. They were my whole world and I would happily give up the crown and my kingdom if it meant we could be together again. &#34;I would do anything to get them back.&#34; I added lamely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should have thought about that before Julian.&#34; She admonished. &#34;You should have thought about that before you got another woman pregnant and set her up as your official mistress.&#34; She shook her head. &#34;I can not stay around and watch you ruin yourself for a whore. So I quit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at her in shock. &#34;You quit?&#34; I parroted back stupidly. &#34;You have been with my family for years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes I have and if Cassie and the boys were here I would remain but they aren&#39;t. I am too disappointed with you. Disgusted-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to them?&#34; I asked and my voice shook. &#34;That&#39;s why you are leaving isn&#39;t it?&#34; My hands curled into fists so tight that my knuckles cracked. &#34;You know where they are and are going to them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no idea where they are Julian.&#34; She answered evenly and her eyes swam with tears that I didn&#39;t understand. &#34;I can see you love them and my heart breaks for you King Julian but even if I knew where they were or where to start looking then I wouldn&#39;t tell you.&#34; Her eyes bored into mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think she knows and has run?&#34; I whispered. And it made sense. If the staff and the kingdom knew Megan was saying I was the father to her child then it made sense that Cassie did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian. Ian knew and they were together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you will never see her again now Julian. I think you have-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roared , whirling around. I lifted the heavy wooden desk and threw it. The force of it smashing the window so the desk fell and splintered into the gardens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie had found out and Ian had helped her escape. He had taken away my family before I could try to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew another thing as well. With Ian&#39;s help Cassie would disappear forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I might not ever see my family again.</p>
