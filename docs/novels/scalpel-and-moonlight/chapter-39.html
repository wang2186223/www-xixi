                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie. You came back.&#34; Scarlette screamed and before I knew what was happening I was grabbed in a bear hug and swung around. Even though Scarlette was a small woman she was strong and her hug could break the ribs of a grown wolf. Or even a bear. The thought made me smile as I detangled myself from her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving her a rueful smile I stepped back. &#34;Hey Scarlette.&#34; I said rubbing at my aching ribs. Truth was my body still felt uncomfortable from last nights attack but I couldn&#39;t say that to her. The less she knew the better and safer she would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I&#39;m sorry.&#34; Scarlette blushed instantly taking note of my pained expression. &#34;Mason is always telling me I don&#39;t know my own strength but after what happened last night I didn&#39;t know whether we would see you again.&#34; She motioned to one of the seats in her office and sank down into the other one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning I took the seat she was offering me. &#34;What do you mean?&#34; I asked evenly. &#34;Did something bad happen last night after I left? Did someone die? Or go down hill.&#34; My palm itched at the thought of it. It always itched when I thought I had lost a patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scarlettes eyes widened. &#34;Oh goddess no Cassie. You were an angel and everyone is doing so much better this morning.&#34; She smiled wildly. &#34;And that&#39;s all thanks to you. We can&#39;t thank you enough. It&#39;s just-&#34; she fell silent and her face was troubled. &#34;The way Prince Julian was looking at you.&#34; Her eyes widened and then narrowed into slits. &#34;When he ordered us away I thought you might have-&#34; Her bottom lip disappeared between her teeth. &#34;Had a run in with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blowing out a breath I forced myself to relax. She didn&#39;t know how right she was but I couldn&#39;t explain to her that my run ins with the Prince were an almost daily occurrence because he was married.  Very few people knew I was his wife and I wanted to keep it that way for as long as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No there was no run in with him.&#34; I smiled politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well that&#39;s good because Mason said you looked like you had been hit in the face when he found you.&#34; My new friends eyes raked over my face. &#34;You still have a mark on your cheekbone. You aren&#39;t protecting someone are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Leaning over I patted her on the back of the hand. Although I was protecting someone and that someone was myself  &#34;I got turned around and lost, and in the darkness I walked right into a low hanging branch.&#34; Self consciously I touched my cheek which still stung. &#34;What kind of wolf does that make me, right ?&#34; I laughed and after a seconds hesitation she laughed along with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have all gotten lost before so I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. As long as you are sure you are ok?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Positive.&#34; From my purse my phone began to ring. &#34;I&#39;m sorry I should- it might be the hospital about my mother.&#34; I apologised quickly but I didn&#39;t need to. Scarlette was already heading out of the office door with a cheery wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take your time. I&#39;ll give you some privacy. Our first class will be arriving any second so just come and find us when you are finished.&#34; She closed the door softly behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing the phone to my face I answered it. It wasn&#39;t the hospital, I recognised the voice straight away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie? Hello Cassie can you hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing heavily I leant back on the chair and pinched the skin between my eyebrows, hard. &#34;What do you want Megan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too tired for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to say-&#34; Megan stuttered to a stop. &#34;Sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes flew open. &#34;I beg your pardon?&#34; I wasn&#39;t sure I had heard her right? Was she really apologising?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I know I acted like a crazy person last night but it&#39;s just because I am in love with him.&#34; She fell silent and a whispering sob sounded in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning even harder, I waited for her to continue. I didn&#39;t know what the hell was going on, was she really crying?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then seeing you two together it just made me lose my head for a second but only because I love him so much. You get that right? You understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was almost begging me to understand her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right you are crazy.&#34;  Crazy for being in love with the giant bully that is my husband. I added silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you forgive me? You will ,won&#39;t you? I asked Julian for a job for you and he has given you an internship with me. That&#39;s good isn&#39;t it?&#34; She rambled on. &#34;I&#39;m trying to make amends Cassie. I don&#39;t want us to be enemies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want us to be enemies either. I had enough of those already. &#34;I don&#39;t hate you Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squealed down the phone. &#34;Then you will come? Head of surgery is expecting you this morning and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Groaning I went back to pinching my eyebrows. This morning? If I took this job it would mean I would have to let Scarlette down and I didn&#39;t want to do that after she had been so good to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Cassie.&#34; Megan begged again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; I said finally. &#34;I&#39;ll be there as soon as I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ending the call without even saying goodbye I sat there for a few minutes and tried to gather my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone call had been beyond strange? Why was Megan trying to help me. We hadn&#39;t even liked each other before she had started sleeping with my husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everything ok Cassie?&#34; Scarlette poked her head around the door. She looked worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve just been offered an surgical internship at the royal hospital.&#34; I admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Squealing she burst through the door. Enveloping me in another rib crushing hug. &#34;Oh Cassie that is wonderful news. When do you start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They want me there this morning.&#34; I admitted. &#34;But I hate to let you down on such short notice. I can phone them and tell them-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flashed. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare. This is a once in a life time opportunity and you have to take it. Don&#39;t you worry about us. I have one of the older students coming in to help this morning as well. Now where is my cheque book?&#34; She began pulling our drawers and rummaging inside</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t expect payment.&#34; I began to say lamely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well I am paying you. You worked hard and it&#39;s only fair. And anyway don&#39;t you have your mothers medical bills to pay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded my head mutely. She was just too sweet and nice. I felt like I was taking advantage of her but she was right about my mothers medical bills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here.&#34; She pushed the cheque over the desk towards me. &#34;And before you go I&#39;m going to need a photo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A photo?&#34; I raised my eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes something for us to remember you by and something you can remember us by as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears prickled my eyes. A lump formed in my throat. I didn&#39;t need a photograph to remember her kindness or the children I had taught. They would always be in my heart. But I would pose for one anyway.</p>
