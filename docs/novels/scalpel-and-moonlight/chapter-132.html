                <p>Life went back to normal. And it threw me for a loop. I knew I shouldn&#39;t be as content as I was. I shouldn&#39;t be happy and able to sleep peacefully at night. Or as peacefully as two little boys who had found their voice could do. Not that I would ever moan about their midnight cries. I would never moan about the life Scarlett had given me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wasn&#39;t real. I knew that as well. I could go about my daily routine, I could cook and clean and walk the garden and the nearby forest with my babies but it wouldn&#39;t last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>War was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there was nothing I could do about that. It was quiet right now. No talk or rumours from the palace. No sight not sound from Julian or Ian. Not even a whisper that he had been caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wasn&#39;t right because it couldn&#39;t last. We were just holding our breath and waiting for something to happen and it would happen soon. I could feel it in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still I tried to enjoy the little bit of peace I was offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you cooking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced up from my bowl and smiled at Scarlett came walking through the back door. She headed straight to the twins , asleep in the bassinet she had brought for us to use downstairs. They filled it completely and soon would out grow it but I loved being able to have them close to me as I cooked. Which I did every day. It soothed my soul to do such a mundane thing even though I was rubbish at it. The only thing I could cook was Eggs royale. The one dish Cathy had taught me to cook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; Scarlett peered at me from beneath her lashes. Her smile wary. &#34;Are you sure your not half bear with the amount of salmon you are eating?&#34; She joked as I continued to whip the eggs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost positive but who knows. This is just the one thing I know I can cook.&#34; I continued doing what needed doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re not tired of it?&#34; Slipping into one of the kiddies chairs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m starting to hate it.&#34; I admitted with a laugh. &#34;But I was never a great cook. Never had a mum to teach me. Cathy taught me this and-&#34; tears made my voice thick. I hated thinking about her and then I hated myself for not thinking about her. &#34;Do you think he put her on the wall?&#34; I asked in a whisper because that had been bothering me a lot since I had got here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly Scarlett was on her feet and hugging me. &#34;You can&#39;t think about it. When this is over , then we will give them the burial they deserve but until then you have to keep the sadness at bay. Have you been outside today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every day.&#34; I admitted. &#34;It&#39;s one of the only things that keeps me sane. Has there been any news?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her arms still around me she gave me a squeeze. &#34;Not yet, there&#39;s a few whispers but they are coming from a million different sources and Julian and Ian can&#39;t be everywhere at once. I know you miss him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss him and Ian as well because he&#39;s my friend. And my mother. I wish I could send word to her because she is going to be out of her mind with worry and then there&#39;s Forrest. It feels like I am betraying them all by being here and living my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would not exactly call this living Cassie. Back when I first met you. When I saw you dance , back then you were living. You might of hated your life but you were living. Not that I expect you to dance now. I couldn&#39;t even if I tried but you do need to enjoy things in your life. You are allowed to do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. I enjoyed being here. I really did. I was content. But was content the same as happy? It felt like - with a sigh I left the food and wandered off to stand and look out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s beautiful here Scarlett and I never want to be ungrateful because you have done so much for us but-&#34; I suxked in a deep breath. &#34;I don&#39;t feel like I have a purpose. I need to have a purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your babies are how old now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost seven weeks I think. I don&#39;t even know really.&#34; I admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back in the human world you wouldn&#39;t even be back to work yet. But I understand what you mean. You need a purpose then I will give you a purpose. But it&#39;s going to take some sacrifices on your part.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want me to do?&#34; I asked eagerly. I didn&#39;t mind sacrifice. My life had been full of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to come down and be our packs doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to move down into the valley?&#34; My heart thundered in my chest. It was the kind of job I had dreamt of since I&#39;d given birth. A chance to do what I was good at and be a mum. But going down to where Scarlett&#39;s pack was dangerous. If people saw me, hell people would see me and a few would even recognise me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading my thoughts on my face, she tapped me on the nose. &#34;If you will allow I will watch the babies for you. And it would only be a few days a week. No long hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People will recognise me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course they will. But my pack is loyal. It will be any one else that comes along that we have a problem and that&#39;s where the sacrifice comes in.&#34; She reached down down and picked up a strand of my long dark hair. &#34;But this will have to go. We need to cut your hair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But not tonight. Tonight you are going to eat something other than salmon and eggs. Like a steak. How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded amazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pack an overnight bag, you&#39;re eating in my home with my pack tonight.&#34;</p>
