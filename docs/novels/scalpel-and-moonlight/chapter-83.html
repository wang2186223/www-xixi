                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly I crept towards the door , trying to keep my shadow hidden but I knew instinctively that whoever was on the other side of the door already knew we were there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daring to dart a look behind me , I motioned for my mum to duck down and hide. Which she quickly did. Crouching down behind the kitchen island and out of eyesight of the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least she was finally getting it. Things were so unbelievably dangerous for us and the sooner she realised that the better. I couldn&#39;t blame her though. In her old head there was still hope for me and Julian but then again she hadn&#39;t been awake when we had first met. She didn&#39;t know how it really was between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hopefully now she never would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second I screwed my eyes up tight and my hand fluttered to my stomach. I had to stop thinking about Julian. My husband would not be kind if he ever found us. In fact I knew deep down he would murder my children in front of me as punishment for me betraying him. Even though he had Megan and didn&#39;t love me, Julian would never allow me to be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I had to stop thinking about him , just like I had to stop thinking about the shadowy stranger who put my babies in my belly. I would never see either of them again. And that was just the way it had to be now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to stop looking back and concentrate on the future. It was the only way I would ever get everyone through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to the door I took another step forward before my eyes snapped open and met those of pretty brown ones which peered at me from the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a scream scrambling back. Almost losing my footing as my hands clutched at my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been so busy thinking about the past that I hadn&#39;t been careful myself and now the woman looking in on me knew I was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She always knew you were here, my wolf said snidely. You&#39;re a fool if you think she didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stared at each other, a flimsy pane of glass between us. She looked harmless but then you could never quite be sure by looking at someone. Megan looked and acted like a brainless bimbo and she had been surprisingly ruthless. Hell she had almost made me lose my pregnancy. I would not make the same mistake twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if she sensed my fear she stepped back with a small wave and smile and disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated. She was still out there. Waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have your back Cassie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced behind me to find my mum behind me with a wicked looking carving knife clutched in her fist. Taking a deep breath I moved towards the door and opened it an inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; My voice timid. A barely there shaking whisper which I hated because I didn&#39;t want it to show any fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie?&#34; The woman was so close that i had no chance of defending myself as she pushed the door open wide and stepped through like she owned the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well finally. I was sure you would sleep the whole day away.&#34; Standing right there on the rug she brushed the rain drops from her shoulders and looked around. Her nose wrinkling. &#34;And you must be the mother. I see you have been busy with the ingredients I left for you.&#34; Without another word she moved towards the kitchen area. Plucking a cookie from the rack she took a huge bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at my mum who was staring open mouthed. &#34;What?&#34; She mouthed and I shrugged. I had no idea what was going on either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t mind do you?&#34; The raven haired beauty lifted the half eaten biscuit with a grin. &#34;These are really good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you? What are you doing here?&#34; Straightening my shoulders I stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused. &#34;I&#39;m Yana.&#34; One bite and the sweet treat disappeared. She waited for me to say something. And when I didn&#39;t she sighed. &#34;He didn&#39;t tell you about me huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know who you are on about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well this property is owned by my family. Most of this area is.&#34; She spread her arms wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Panther.&#34; My mum hissed her eyes wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we are.&#34; My voice shook even more. Panthers and wolves didn&#39;t really get on and I could understand my mothers fear but in a way knowing she was a sometimes enemy of my kind made me feel more at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least I knew she wasn&#39;t working for Prince Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we are trespassing then I apologise. We were told we could be safe here but-&#34; I chin jerked towards the door. &#34;We are leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh stop being so daft Cassie.&#34; Laughing Yana slipped onto one of the stools. &#34;And come and talk to me. Did you find the tea helped with your morning sickness? I asked some of the others and they all swear by it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You- &#34; I stuttered. &#34;You know I&#39;m pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing she shook her dark curls around her face. &#34;Of course I do. I know all about you. I had to, if we were going to help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thundering heart slowed to a more steady beat. I trusted her even when I knew I shouldn&#39;t. If she wanted me dead I would have been dead by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were told to expect you. Not so soon but we will adapt and overcome.&#34; She laughed. &#34;Honestly we are in need of a shifter doctor if your feeling up to it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you know about me?&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kick ass doctor, wife of that asshole prince Julian.&#34; She lifted two fingers. &#34;Knocked up by -&#34; a smile spread across her face. &#34;Well my mate has his theories on that but we will see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is your mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yana looked at me like I was stupid. &#34;The person who sent you here of course.&#34; She said with a laugh. &#34;Beta Ian is my mate.&#34;</p>
