                <p>&#34;Forced to marry a cold werewolf prince, human doctor Cassie discovers a deadly secret: she&#39;s the mate he hunted. To survive his court&#39;s claws, she must heal their fractured bond—or destroy him with the scalpel he gifted her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop fussing.&#34; Next to me, his back ramrod straight under his ill fitting suit my father growled. Reluctantly I forced my fingers to lose their death grip on the simple dress he had forced me to wear. Smoothing the material back over my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean seriously Cassie you could at least pretend to be excited.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Side eyeing him I frowned. He needed to make his mind up. Either I was fidgeting too much with nerves or I wasn&#39;t excited enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting my lips I turned my attention back to the alter. We had been here an hour already. A whole sixty minutes of being alone with my father who hated my guts for no other reason than I was born a girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an hour too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is an important day.&#34; He continued to mutter out of the corner of his mouth. &#34;And an honour. Do not ruin this for your family. You have to do your duty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again I remained silent. I had heard this spiel so many times before. First growing up when I had first found out the arrangement that would have me wed to the heir to the Lycan king and then later as an adult when it became obvious that he hadn&#39;t found his fated mate and the arrangement would go through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was archaic. So old fashioned it should have been something I was reading about in a textbook and not living.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I get that. Time for me to save the family.&#34; I couldn&#39;t help it. I rolled my eyes. Something I hadn&#39;t done since I was a teenager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to me, my father growled low and hard. The hatred in it should have scared me but it didn&#39;t anymore. I&#39;d been living with that hatred for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pinching my chin between his thumb and forefinger cruelly he tilted my face up to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough of your back chat Cassie. You are an adult. You will do this for your family, for our good name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at him definitely I ripped my face from his hands and I growled up at him. He was a fine one to talk about the good name of our family. Him, who had lost our fortune and made us outcasts. Him that had abandoned me and my mother in her time of need to run away with a young she wolf who was more tits than brains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father was everything a man shouldn&#39;t be and the last wolf in the world who should be lecturing me on what my duty was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he was the man who controlled the money and without his help, I didn&#39;t know how I would pay for my mother&#39;s medical bills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, papa.&#34; I lowered my eyes slowly. I hated showing him any kind of submission but he was right. I did need to do this. Maybe not for the reasons he mentioned but for my mothers and it wouldn&#39;t be that bad. I would have been standing within the pack again and my mother would have the best medical care money could buy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind me the door opened and heavy footsteps walked towards us. My father turned, dragging me by the hand so I could see my new mate for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My resolve shattered the moment I set eyes on the old man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was ancient. Older than even my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging my hand from my father&#39;s I clutched the simple necklace between my fingers. Twisting the chain until it dug into my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t do this. I couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just too old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could I be expected to tie myself to someone who was the same age as my grandfather?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do not embarrass me.&#34; My father hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a problem here?&#34; Coming to a stop in front of me, the stranger studied my face. My thoughts must have been clear on my face because he cleared his throat loudly. &#34;I am Casper. I am here on behalf of Gabriel. Unfortunately, the prince couldn&#39;t be here today but he sends his warm affections.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a sigh of relief I glanced between the two men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shall we get started? I have a dinner reservation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait what?&#34; Confused, I took a step back. My eyes locked on my father. &#34;But the prince isn&#39;t here. How can we-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will stand in and sign what needs to be signed on the prince&#39;s behalf. I already have his blood oath. It&#39;s not ideal but -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But how can this be legal? How can he want to marry me, mate me without even meeting me? He might not even like me?&#34; I wailed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men turned to me with bemused looks on their faces. &#34;I can promise you this is perfectly legal and binding. Let&#39;s get on with things shall we.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men stepped forward together, chatting quietly and I could do nothing but stare at them. Surely this couldn&#39;t be real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did they really expect me to go through with this? Marry a man who was a literal stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come Cassie. Sign here and then it is done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking wildly I stepped between them. Breathing heavily through my mouth I stared down at the scroll laid out before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a splodge of blood under the prince&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sign.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trembling so much I almost dropped the pen I signed my name next to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; My father&#39;s growling warning made me shake his bed. He wanted me to do something but I didn&#39;t know what it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I swear you are as useless as your mother.&#34; Grabbing hold of my hand he brought it to his mouth. His teeth tore into my finger and blood bubbled up. He pressed my bloody finger to the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sealing my fate and tying me to a man who couldn&#39;t even be bothered to turn up to our wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was that simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There.&#34; He dropped my hand like I disgusted him. And this time when he looked at me he didn&#39;t even try and hide his hatred. &#34;It is done and you and your worthless mother are no longer my concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Papa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No Cassie. You are so worthless not even your mate can stand to be in the same room as you. Such  a disappointment.&#34; He shook his head. &#34;I am done with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Papa please.&#34; Never once in my adult life had I begged him. Not once but I pleaded with him now. I begged him not to abandon us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking away he didn&#39;t even turn around. He simply walked out to the church to meet his new wife and left me with the stranger who was staring at me with a look on his face that I couldn&#39;t read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I uh-&#34; I scrubbed at my face, smearing my make up under my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there somewhere I can drive you, Cassie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; I managed to mumble. &#34;Is the prince not meeting me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something shifted in his eyes. &#34;He will send for you shortly I am sure but now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hospital then.&#34; Drawing my shoulders back I stared at the door where my father had disappeared. I didn&#39;t need him. Or the prince for that matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would be just fine. I always was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I&#39;m not needed then I will go to work.&#34;</p>
