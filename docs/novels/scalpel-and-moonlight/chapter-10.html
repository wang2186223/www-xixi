                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding my mother&#39;s cold hand in mine I stiffened. The warmth that I had felt early that day when I had been treating Alpha Bill was running down my arm again. Not as painfully as it was but it was still there.  Burning and uncomfortable but somehow I couldn&#39;t seem to stop. Even if I wanted to, I didn&#39;t let go of my mother&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had been thinking about what he had said all day. Did I have some kind of gift?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the end of the day it didn&#39;t really matter why I suddenly seemed to have glowing fingers. I had much more important things to concentrate on. And the woman on the bed was my main priority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I missed my mum, and I wanted her to wake up. No one know why she was in a coma. I had my suspicions both as a doctor and as her daughter but they weren&#39;t exactly medical, so I kept them to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on mamma.&#34; I whispered the old childhood name I had for her.  I always slipped up and called her that when we were alone. Probably because I needed her more than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My life was spiralling out of control. I had lost the job of my dreams and I was now married to a man who hated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all such a mess and I needed my mum to make it better.  That&#39;s what mums were there for right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you.&#34;  Screwing my eyes up I filled my brain with memories of happier times and they were so clear that I could almost smell the sunshine in the leaves as we played together. I didn&#39;t even know how old I had been on that day. Probably no more than twelve. We had been - I frowned with my eyes closed. I couldn&#39;t remember where I had been. All I remembered was that I had been happy. The last time I had been truly happy with both my parents. Before it had all changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie?&#34; There was a small tapping sound on the door and the warmth in my body returned to normal. The golden glow blinked out of existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey.&#34; I nodded to the nurse who was hovering in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I didn&#39;t mean to disturb you. It&#39;s just there&#39;s someone Mandy wants you to see before you leave. I can sit with her if you like.&#34; Walking into the room she stared down at my mother. Cocking her head to the side she frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to - just check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was up and out of the seat in an instant. Staring down at my mother with eyes that seemed to be hazy. &#34;Why what&#39;s wrong? Has something changed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, the nurse turned to me. &#34;She looks different don&#39;t you think? Better?&#34; Reaching out she pressed her hand to my mothers cheek. &#34;She has colour in her face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she? I frowned. &#34;Maybe a little.&#34; I admitted softly.  &#34;Yes.&#34; I began to nod my head because the nurse was right she did look better. Almost like she was just asleep. The sallow yellowness was gone from her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked . Healthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go and do whatever it is that Mandy wants you do Doctor Cassie.&#34; The nurses lips twitched. &#34;I&#39;ll do some checks on our sleeping beauty here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok and thank you. Let me know -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t get to finish as she slipped into my spot by my mothers side. Part of me didn&#39;t want to go but I had to check on the alpha called Bill before I went home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips thinned into a sneer as I walked down the empty corridors. Home. It was funny to call it that when I was never going to be comfortable there. It wasn&#39;t my home. It was my marital prison. I&#39;d been forced to give up my home when I had been married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I would just start sleeping in my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one stopped to chat to me as I moved through the hospital, across the small court yard and into the annex. It was even more quiet here. So quiet that I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You could hear a pin drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside me my slumbering wolf raised her head and sniffed the air whining.  She didn&#39;t want me to any further and I didn&#39;t know why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sssh now.&#34; I whispered to myself as another whine escaped my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was that all about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing my way into the private room I plastered my face with my work smile. The one that was all forced and toothy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; He was reclining on the bed. His bandaged arm thrown over his eyes like he was shielding them from the lights. &#34;You came back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing I crossed the space between us. &#34;Yes I said I would. It&#39;s my job. Let&#39;s have a look at your arm?&#34; I tried to force his arm down and he groaned again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping back I frowned. &#34;You are in pain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The lights are splitting my head wide open.&#34; He muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok, let&#39;s dim these for you.&#34; I quickly turned the lights down before moving back to him. &#34;Is that better?&#34; Holding his arm tenderly in my hands I began to unwind the bandages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in his voice made my head snap up. His eyes which only seconds before had been hazy with pain were clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clear and bright with his wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Much more intimate-&#34; He crooned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What-&#34; I didn&#39;t have a chance to finish the sentence as a fine mist from a tiny spray bottle was sprayed into my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly my vision swam. It was like I was drunk. I wanted to ask what the hell he had just squirted me with but my tongue felt thick and swollen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no pain but the effects of it was instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My legs bucked as if my body was suddenly to heavy. Easily Bill caught me. Lifting me like I weighed nothing at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the soft sheets of the bed as he laid me down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s better.&#34; Almost tenderly he caressed my face, pushing my hair back so he could bring his lips to my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stiffened as realisation hit me. I didn&#39;t know what he had sprayed on me but I knew why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed me like this. Unable to fight back because my limbs were too heavy.  It didn&#39;t take a genius to know what his intentions were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop.&#34; My voice sounded funny but at least I could talk again and if I could talk then I could call for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sssh now.&#34; He rolled on top of me. Half crushing my body under his much bigger one. And he was so heavy that I could barely breathe . &#34;Just relax. You&#39;re so beautiful.&#34; Bill&#39;s lips moved over my throat and trailed down and at the same time his hands roved upwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tugging my blouse out of my trousers so he could slip his hands up and under it. His fingers spread wide as he ran them over the skin of my ribs and further up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I thrashed. My heavy arms tried desperately to push him off of me. I didn&#39;t want him to touch me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop fighting.&#34; He growled out as his hand closed over my bra and squeezed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I would never stop fighting, not ever. I wasn&#39;t some timid she wolf who would roll over and give in to his demands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening my mouth wide I began to scream , loud agonised cries that seemed to echo around the quiet annex. I called out for help , the hospital was full of people and someone was bound to hear me and some to help me and the entire time I struggled against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I might not be fighting for my life but I was fighting for my virtue. I would not let this man use my body for his own twisted gratification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fist made contact with the side of his throat and alpha bill grunted and reared back. My blouse ripped, the bottoms scattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bills lips thinned and pulled back over his teeth as he snarled into my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fist smashed downwards. And my vision turned black for a second as it came crashing down into the side of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It didn&#39;t have to be this way Cassie. I didn&#39;t want to hurt you.&#34; Again his fist made contact with my temple and I went limp. The fight left me as I sagged backwards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop fighting.&#34;</p>
