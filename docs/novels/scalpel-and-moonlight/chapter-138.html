                <p>When I opened the door the next morning, they were all there. Every single one of them, sat or standing on the porch and by the looks they were giving each other tempers hadn&#39;t cooled down over night. Not that I expected them to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing I stared at them all in turn. &#34;Have you all stopped acting like children and made friends now?&#34; I asked and the corners of my mouth twitched. I already knew the answer to that question. They hated each other as much as they had last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No?&#34; Closing my hand around the door I went to swing it shut on their faces. If they wanted to act like children then I would treat them all like children. &#34;No breakfast for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinning from ear to ear I swung open the door again and enveloped Yanna is a bear hug. &#34;Apart from you because I like you.&#34; I whispered into her hair. &#34;The others not so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She giggled. &#34;It&#39;s good to see you and I would love breakfast but I have to keep an eye on that one.&#34; She nodded her head towards Ian. &#34;He doesn&#39;t seem to like your new guard very much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m pretty sure the feeling is mutual. I&#39;m not sure I like her. I don&#39;t even know her name.&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My name is Melina. And you don&#39;t have to like me Cassie. I&#39;m not here to be your friend, I&#39;m here to guard you.&#34; She tilted her chin up. &#34;The king wouldn&#39;t hear of you being unguarded. He cares for your safety.&#34; Her eyes met Julian&#39;s and he growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. Here they went again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nice to meet you Melina but please stop threatening my friends. If you can all promise to get on then you can come in and I&#39;ll put some coffee on. It&#39;s cold out here and -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t promise to get on with her.&#34; Ian spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then stay outside. My children are in there asleep and I won&#39;t have you acting like children around them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh the babies.&#34; Yanna slipped her arm through mine. &#34;Can I meet them? Can I have cuddles? I can&#39;t believe you had them in secret. Your mum was beside herself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let her inside , hearing the sounds of the others shuffle in and begin to make themselves at home behind me. Leading her into the kitchen I pointed to the bassinet and went about making coffee and toast for everyone now milling around in my small home. I could make them the one egg dish I knew but there was no way in hell I could manage it for this many people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh Cassie. They are -&#34; Yanna whirled me around , and hugged me close. She sobbed into my shoulder and after a second I held her close and cried right along with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are beautiful and I am so glad you are ok. I had to come even though Ian is so mad at me.&#34; Her hand settled on her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced down. &#34;I&#39;m mad at you as well. But goddess I am so glad you are here. I&#39;ve missed you so much. How is everyone?&#34; I searched her face. &#34;How is my mum?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s good, she wanted to come but we talked her out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; I really wanted my mum but Yanna had done the right thing. Here was not the place for a woman getting ovep heart surgery. I knew it was for the best but I suddenly missed my mum. I wanted her to meet her grand babies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s going to make such a great nanna.&#34; Yanna said. &#34;I asked if mine can call her that as well I hope you don&#39;t mind?&#34; She side eyed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not.&#34; I already classed Yanna as my sister anyway so I could happily share my mum. &#34;But does that mean her and your dad are-&#34; I waggled my eyebrows suggestively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They say no but I think-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know what made me look towards the back window but I was glad I did because there he was. Caspian, king of the Lycans and my father. The impossibly powerful man who thought my mum was his mate. If mum was falling in love with another things were about to get very very awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Holy fucking shit.&#34; Yannas fingers clutched my arm painfully. &#34;Who the hell is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Detangling myself from her grip , I moved towards the back door. &#34;He&#39;s my dad. The real one. Blood and all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s a Lycan.&#34; She hissed. &#34;Like the one outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; I stood aside to let Caspian enter. &#34;He&#39;s her king.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning.&#34; He nodded his head to Yanna who shrank back. Her back hitting the bassinet and making the babies wail. The sound of their crying filled the house. Causing Julian to appear in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have heard great things about you Yanna.&#34; Caspian nodded his head politely. &#34;You are a skilled fighter. Thank you for being my fighters friend and protector. And your mate also.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yanna looked at me in shock &#34;what&#39;s going on ?&#34; She mouthed and I gave her a small shrug. I had absolutely no idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has been true and loyal to her and I appreciate that. The Lycans are in both of your debts. We always reward loyalty -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you have something to say to me, King Caspian.&#34; Julian stepped to my side and pulled me into his hip. The very air around him seemed to flicker with hostility. He hadn&#39;t said one word to me since I had opened the door this morning and here he was trying to claim ownership of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like nothing had changed at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yanked myself out of his grasp and glared at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have plenty to say to you Julian.&#34; Caspian bit his bottom lip as he stared at my husband and found him lacking. &#34;None of it will be pleasant. I think it&#39;s time we had a serious talk don&#39;t you? One king to another.&#34;</p>
