                <p>I didn&#39;t know why I followed Julian but never in a million years had I expected him to grab at Cassie. I knew Cassie as a colleague although we definitely weren&#39;t friends. I could even remember her being at my leaving party although the details were a little blurry because I had drunk so much champagne that night but seeing them together struck something in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie was a know it all prude. Not someone who a man as good looking as Julian should be chasing. But he was chasing her. And it was only when I tiptoed closer through the trees that I finally heard their conversion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have I broken you already?&#34; His voice was a soft almost sarcastic whisper as he bent her over his arm, his lips just inches from hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You make me sick.&#34; She hissed , twisting her face away like Julian wasn&#39;t one of the most handsome men in the country. No woman in her right mind would not want to kiss him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew the few kisses and soft touches I had shared with him had been mind blowing. It was one of the reasons I had followed him in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want a divorce Julian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A coldness enveloped me. And a line appeared between my eyebrows as I frowned. They were married? When had that happened? Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had so many questions and no way of getting answers. Not without moving and showing them that I was out here listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips found hers. His kiss was brutal and jealousy raged through me when he moaned into her mouth and held her even tighter against his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Julian nipped at Cassie&#39;s lip. Pulling the bottom one away from her gums playfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She beat his shoulders but she couldn&#39;t get away. I couldn&#39;t even be sure that she wanted to get away because it looked to me like she enjoyed the feel of his mouth on hers and his hands on her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will never give you a divorce Cassie.&#34; He said when she finally moved her face away. &#34;I will never let you be free.&#34; Instead of kissing her lips , his mouth descended to her throat. He nipped and sucked and the entire time she beat at his shoulders feebly. &#34;You are mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why Julian?&#34; Her fingers dug into the muscles of his shoulders. &#34;Because you are so in love with me?&#34; Her voice dripped with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held my breath. Was he in love with her? Was that the reason they were married? Had this been a love match?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please Cassie.&#34; He bit down and even from where I was crouched hidden I could see her wince back and her eyes roll back in ecstasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t love you. Never have and never will. But.&#34; He rubbed at the crescent shape of the teeth prints in her throat. He hadn&#39;t broken her skin but it was close. &#34;I do love making your life miserable. The idea of imprisoning you.&#34; He laughed coldly. &#34;Of keeping you as mine and torturing you forever is a massive turn on to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In answer Cassie stamped down, her foot coming down hard on his instep. Julian howled as he reared back but it gave Cassie the opportunity she needed to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as she ran through the trees before letting my eyes fall back on him. Julian hadn&#39;t moved after her but he was staring in her direction with a mixture of longing and admiration on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cared for her. It hit me in a rush. He actually cared for her. They might pretend this was just an arrangement and the fact that their wedding hadn&#39;t been publicized told me it had probably started like that but there were feelings there as well. They might be all mixed up with the hate but he liked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might even like her more than he liked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my little hot headed wolf.&#34; Julian shook his head with a chuckle. &#34;Always so quick to run from me. But I&#39;m not chasing you this time-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. Had he chased her before. Run her down and caught her like she was prey? And what had happened after he had trapped her. I already knew the answer to that. The passion and fire between them was off the charts. Julian had never once chased me. It was always me who chased him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even tonight I was the one to follow him. Forced to sulk around in the shadows to see what he was doing and now I knew. He was out here canoodling with his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was losing him and that couldn&#39;t happen. I liked having Julian in my life it gave me so many opportunities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s see how you like walking home little hot head.&#34; Still chuckling to himself he walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a choice to make. I could follow after him or go after Cassie. In the end there really wasn&#39;t any debate. I launched myself after Cassie. Catching up with her quickly I reached out and caught a handful of her hair. Yanking it back so viciously and so unexpectedly that she fell backwards with a cry on to her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not giving her a chance to defend herself I pinned her down onto the wet leaves and slapped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whore.&#34; My words screeched out of my mouth like a banshee cry. Again and again I slapped her. Rocking Cassie&#39;s head side to side. &#34;You stay away from him. Stay away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie blinked up at me surprised like she was shocked to see me there but the moment she realised it was me she reacted. Twisting quicker than I thought possible she threw me off and to the side. Springing up into a defensive crouching position with something that had a sharp silver point in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay the fuck away from me Megan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a pen in her hand. An expensive silver tipped pen. It wasn&#39;t much of a weapon but I knew Cassie was more than capable of doing damage with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean it megan. You come near me again and I&#39;ll put this through your eye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I believed her. &#34;Just stay away from him.&#34; I growled at her. &#34;He&#39;s mine. He doesn&#39;t love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie sneered. &#34;You are welcome to him. I don&#39;t want him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re his wife and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want him.&#34; Cassie almost screamed. &#34;No woman worth her salt would want a bully like him.&#34; She straightened. &#34;So you can have him. You two deserve each other. Both of you are worthless bully&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words cut deeper than I wanted to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t let you take him from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie straightened. A look of sympathy on her face. &#34;And I&#39;ve told you I don&#39;t want him. Have him. Take him off my hands but do not come near me again Megan. You won&#39;t like what Julian does to people who mess with his property and he think I am his.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step back and then another. She had a point there even though I didn&#39;t want to admit it. The marriage was obviously a contract but those were just as dangerous as the unions forged from love because Julian would think she was his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie was his wife by law. And I was-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whimpered. I was the woman who had taken his money and lied to get it. I was in a very dangerous situation and I knew it. Hitting Cassie, attacking her again in any way wasn&#39;t a good idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s mine Cassie, stay away.&#34; I turned on my heel and limped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can have him. No one but you would take his crap.&#34; Cassie called after me but I didn&#39;t turn back. I just walked away and tried to figure out my next move.</p>
