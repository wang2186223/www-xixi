                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came too, to the sound of soft desperate cries. Groggily because it didn&#39;t feel like my body worked I shifted my weight and tried to open my eyes but it felt like my lashes were stuck together. Glueing my eyes shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving a cry I lashed out, scrubbing at my face only one of my arms seemed to be tethered to something that kept it locked in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy.&#34; Ian&#39;s voice spoke from right next to me. &#34;Stop fighting you are going to yank out the tube.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I settled a little bit but I was still on edge and the cries continued. Weak little desperate wails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cries of my babies. I realised with a start. I began to struggle some more. I needed to get to them. Comfort them. Using my free hand I clawed at my eyes. Unsticking them so I could see more clearly and Ian&#39;s face swam into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it Cassie.&#34; He warned. &#34;You are going to hurt yourself again. And you&#39;re already so weak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t feel weak. I felt adrenaline pumping through me. And the overwhelming primal need to get to my babies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My babies-&#34; I managed to croak even though my tongue felt thick and dry in my parched mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Healthy strong boys.&#34; Ian sat himself back down. &#34;Hungry but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let me feed them.&#34; My breasts felt heavy and full. &#34;Let me go to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet. You aren&#39;t strong enough yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked at him angrily, gritting my teeth. I didn&#39;t know why he was being so difficult. &#34;Bring me my babies Ian. Now. They are hungry and I want to feed them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t move. &#34;You can&#39;t even sit upright unaided Cassie. Goddess.&#34; He lifted his arm and ruffled his hair. Leaving it standing on end. &#34;You almost died. Bled out in front of my eyes.&#34; His voice broke a little and I gave a startled intake of breath. Had I almost died? It had just felt like I had fallen into an exhausted little nap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you at least let the transfusion finish first.&#34; He lifted his other arm and my eyes widened. That&#39;s why it felt like one of my arms was tethered , because I was. To him. He was pumping his blood directly into my veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you even know what blood group I am?&#34; I hissed. &#34;That is stupidly dangerous. The wrong blood could have killed me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged with one shoulder. &#34;You were dying anyway so it was a risk I was willing to take. Plus you seem fine now. How are you actually feeling?&#34; His eyes studied me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel- fine.&#34; Weirdly that was the truth. &#34;A little woozy and achy but I don&#39;t feel like I was on death&#39;s door. Your blood must be working.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian studied me for a second. His face was unreadable. &#34;I think I just gave you some time to heal yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you learn to do that?&#34; I asked as I watched him slide the needle from my arm and wrap it in a scrap of curtain. He quickly did the same to his own arm and moved away to discard the apparatus out of sight. &#34;I&#39;m a warrior, remember. Today is not the first time I&#39;ve had to donate blood in the field.&#34; He called back and I lapsed into silence. He hadn&#39;t even hesitated. He had just given me his life&#39;s blood. Even though it would weaken him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long have I been out?&#34; I asked when he reappeared. Holding his hand over his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About six hours.&#34; He admitted. Carefully he flexed his arm. Glancing down at it to make sure it wasn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit.&#34; I glanced around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; He moved easily. First helping me to sit upright and then bringing my babies to me one after another. They wanted feeding and I wanted to provide for them but I didn&#39;t know how to go about breast feeding with Ian staring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you need to feed them. Then do it.&#34; Ian shrugged. &#34;I have seen more of you then I ever thought possible Cassie.&#34; He laughed and I laughed along with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They seem to have fallen back to sleep anyway.&#34; And they had. Both of my sons were now snoozing peacefully in my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it would seem. But you must feed them soon. And eat yourself. You have to keep your strength up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; I glanced away from my babies face and around the spacious room. It was empty apart from the four of us. &#34;Wait you said I&#39;ve been unconscious for six hours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Almost seven now.&#34; Ian began pacing. Tugging on his hair as he went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has Julian been back?&#34; I was almost too afraid to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even pause his pacing. &#34;No.&#34; He admitted after a second and shook his head. &#34;And the new king bells have no rung. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard and in my arms my sons squirmed like they could sense my discomfort. I whispered to them. Until they went back to their deep sleeps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should they have rung?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. It&#39;s protocol. To signify a new King has taken the throne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re worried.&#34; I didn&#39;t ask it because it wasn&#39;t a question. It was a statement of fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze, turning to me slowly. &#34;I won&#39;t lie to you Cassie. Yes I am worried. He would have had the bells rung and he would have come back to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath and tried to calm my rapidly beating heartbeat. Panicking now wouldn&#39;t do anyone any good. I needed to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think he is dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian&#39;s eyes met mine. &#34;You would know better than me if he had lost his life Cassie. Julian is your mate. Is he dead? Is our king dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I searched my heart. I was nervous and afraid but-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;I don&#39;t think he&#39;s dead.&#34; I said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good. I can work with not dead.&#34; Ian forced himself to smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what is the plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Plan?&#34; He parroted back. Confusing pinched his eyebrows together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do we get him out of whatever trouble he is in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t do anything Cassie. I get you and those babies somewhere safe and then I&#39;ll get Julian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes you are.&#34; His voice was firm. &#34;If something has happened to Julian then those babies in your arms are our next rulers. They must be kept safe.&#34;</p>
