                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hood which I suspected was some kind of sack because it smelt like potatoes was pulled off my head. Quickly I looked around trying to get my bearings and the sight I was greeted with was a sorry one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Badly stained weirdly patterned carpet under my feet. The soles of my shoes already sticking to it and grimy green wallpapered walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two queen sized beds were in the middle of the room and- I didn&#39;t get to see anything else because a man stepped in front of me blocking my view. My eyes darted away. It was much safer looking at the world most depressing hotel room then looking at him directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t even look at me, hey little princess?&#34; Rough fingers gripped my chin and tilted it upright. They weren&#39;t rough because of a hard days work like a man&#39;s though they were sand paper rough like his skin was cracking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a damn princess.&#34; Angrily I tore my face away from his grasp. &#34;And I&#39;m not afraid of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Bill smiled and it was so predatory that my skin crawled. He didn&#39;t look like a man or even a wolf. He looked like a dead eyed shark. Every atom of my being wanted to run away screaming. Because this time I was going to be devoured and I knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re married to a prince.&#34; His grin grew until it seemed his entire face was just teeth. Grotesque and spooky. &#34;And that makes you a princess, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was terrified but I didn&#39;t want to show him that. There was some small part of me that was screaming at me to run or to beg or just do something to get away but I pushed that part down. I could tell that Bill got off on my fear, he enjoyed it and it turned him on. So I wasn&#39;t going to give him the satisfaction of seeing how petrified I really was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If this is about my husband then you are sadly misinformed. He won&#39;t come for me, if your plan is some kind of assassination attempt.&#34; My voice stayed even and even a little strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Go me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if you are looking for money then he won&#39;t pay anything for my safe return. Julian doesn&#39;t care for me at all. He will probably thank you for taking me off his hands.&#34; I tried to joke with a small forced smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not.&#34; Bill&#39;s smile slipped. And my heart sank. &#34;I don&#39;t need Julian&#39;s money.&#34; He gave a small nod of his head and the enforcers behind me moved towards me in a rush. My hands which were still shackled behind my back were grabbed roughly. I didn&#39;t put up much of a fight at first not until i saw where they were dragging me and then i dropped my legs and twisted wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were pulling me towards the bed and there were already ropes there. Ropes for my arms and for my ankles which would keep me spread eagled on that disgusting mattress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realisation of what Bill planned for me made me want to vomit but I kept on fighting. It wasn&#39;t even surprising because he had tried this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it didn&#39;t matter how much I fought I was no match for the two huge men who forced me down on to my back and secured my arms with the rough rope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the attempted to spread my legs and secure them as well I kicked out with all my might. Smashing one of them straight in the nose. It exploded with blood. And he reeled back howling in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bitch.&#34; He took a threatening step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled up at him like a feral animal. &#34;I hope that fucking hurt you rapist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled and the blood from his nose had dripped down and coated his teeth. &#34;Oh you&#39;re going to wish it was me in your body. You will wish it was me.&#34; The look on his face made my blood run cold. &#34;My bones will heal but you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough Carlo.&#34; Bill snapped and the giant of a man instantly stepped back with his eyes glued to the floor. &#34;You are scaring our guests. Both of you can leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They followed his command instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alone at last, beautiful Cassie.&#34; Bill moved around the bed. His eyes studied me like he was eyeing up a horse to buy or maybe it was a cow that he wanted to butcher and eat. I swallowed down my fear. My eyes followed his every movement. If he attacked I wanted to be ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you are wrong, you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About?&#34; My eyes widened as he began to unbutton his shirt slowly. It was almost like he wanted to give me a show. Or maybe he just wanted to draw out the fear that I could feel bubbling up in my stomach. It would spill over soon and I would whimper with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What your husband feels for you.&#34; The shirt slid off his shoulders to reveal a body that once upon a time must have been great but was not podgy with age. &#34;He pretends he hates you but-&#34; a small chuckle. And it froze the blood in my veins. &#34;Everyone sees how he looks at you. How he covets you. Julian can deny it all he wants but he cares for you. But that doesn&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t?&#34; If this wasn&#39;t about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No it won&#39;t change what happens here Cassie.&#34; Bill hungrily eyed my breasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am Prince Julian&#39;s wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I know.&#34; Bill grinned like a crazy person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will kill you if you touch me. He will rip you apart.&#34; I snarled because I didn&#39;t like the way he was looking at me but I knew I would like what came next even less. The longer I could keep him talking the better. I had to believe Julian had realised I was missing by now and was looking for me. It was a feeble hope but I had to hold on to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will never find you.&#34; Stepping closer to the bed Bill learnt over me. His hands sliding down my cheek. &#34;I am taking you home with me. To my pack and Julian will never know what happened to you. You will be our healer and-&#34; His fingers rubbed against my lips. Parting them so he could shove his fingers inside as far as they would go. I gagged and his eyes sparkled with desire. &#34;Mine. You will share my bed and ease my desires.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not a prostitute.&#34; I snapped my teeth and he only just removed his fingers in time. &#34;And I will never be your mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His slap stung but didn&#39;t really hurt. &#34;I love your fire Cassie. The fact that you fight back is what made me obsessed with you. And I&#39;ll enjoy breaking you of this fiery spirit very much.&#34; Suddenly he gripped my chin in a punishing hold.  &#34;But I never said you would share my bed as an equal. You won&#39;t be my mate or even a prostitute. You will be my own personal slave.&#34; He yanked my mouth down so my mouth was wide open. &#34;You will take care of my every need. My little sex slave.&#34; His fingers hooked into my mouth. &#34;I am looking forward to taking this mouth and teaching it to be quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll fight you.&#34; I growled out the moment his fingers left my mouth and moved to the front of my dress. &#34;I won&#39;t let you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fight away princess. I like it when they fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I instantly became still. If he wanted me to fight then I would do the opposite. I wouldn&#39;t give him the satisfaction. It would just turn him on more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first I didn&#39;t know who had spoken and it took me a few seconds to realise that the voice was Julians. But he wasn&#39;t in the room. This was all in my head. My imagination was taking on my husband&#39;s persona.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shift and get to the window.&#34; Julian&#39;s hissing whisper said again and it was like I was hearing it in my ear.  &#34;Throw yourself out. Your wolf can take the fall. Just don&#39;t let him touch you like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have such a beautiful body Cassie. All curves in the right places, all firm unmarked skin. I&#39;m looking forward to -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t let him finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My shift was violent and it hurt but the ropes gave way and shred straight away. I leapt away , I didn&#39;t look at anything but the small window on the far wall. It was tiny but it didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I could get to it I could launch myself at it, break the glass and make my escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A foot away my legs gave way and my vision swirled around me. It felt like the room was spinning and I couldn&#39;t stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t get off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned and disoriented I fell to the floor in my human form. Curling up on myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move Cassie.&#34; Julian&#39;s voice said more urgently. He was sounding more and more like me now.  &#34;Fight against it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t.&#34; I whispered but my lips didn&#39;t even move and only a garbled cry came out of my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t move at all. I was paralysed and completely helpless.</p>
