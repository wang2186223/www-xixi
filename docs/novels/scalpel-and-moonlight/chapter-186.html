                <p>The words screamed through my mind even as huge raspy screams erupted from my throat. This couldn&#39;t be happening. It couldn&#39;t.</p>

                <p>My screams died in my throat , as I struggled to get away from the man standing in the doorway with his mouth open and a shocked look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My movements were jerky, my balance completely off. I tumbled from the hospital bed to land on my ass with a thump. Wires and iv lines tore from my skin. Machines toppled over to surround me in shrieking machinery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scuttled backwards on my ass, pushing with my weak legs until I couldn&#39;t go any further and I was wedged into a corner and the entire time I didn&#39;t take my eyes from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My husband stood alive and well. His handsome face was so familiar to me but at the same time he had changed. There was a speckling of grey at his temples now. More lines around his eyes but his face was still as ruggedly handsome as I remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he couldn&#39;t be here. He was dead. I had seen him die. I&#39;d tried and failed to save him and his hearts blood had bubbled up between my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian was dead but he was standing right in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was that possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a dream. It had to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s what the voice had kept saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor what is wrong with her?&#34; He took another step into the room, and then stopped as I hid my face away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to see my dead mate. If this was a death dream then the goddess was cruel indeed to show me him. If I was to see him again then I wanted it to be a happy reunion in the afterlife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted it to be forever. I didn&#39;t want this Julian. This angry hard faced man , so like the Julian I had first married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think she is just in shock.&#34; The doctor crouched down in front of me. Right in front of me so she hid my view of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly she closed her hands around my wrists and tried to pull my hands down where they covered my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; She said softly. &#34;You&#39;re highness you&#39;re safe I promise you.  Just take a deep breath. It will help settle your heartbeat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to do what she asked but it was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it. Just in and out. Your husband is just here to check on you. You remember Julian right. You remember him? Or are things a little fuzzy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was fuzzy. I didn&#39;t know what was reality or a death dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, my lank hair whipping back and forth across my face. I peeked at his face thought my fingers. Why did he look the same but so different?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe you should step out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a chance until I know she&#39;s ok. I just need to make sure she&#39;s ok and then I&#39;ll go and get the boys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped my hands to my lap and stared at him. &#34;Niall and Noah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of surprise flickered across Julian&#39;s face. His eyes darted to the doctors. &#34;You told her their names?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. &#34;No, they were the first thing she asked for. She already knew what you named them. If I had to guess I would say she heard. Some people in comas come out having heard everything that was discussed around them.&#34; She said softly. &#34;I&#39;ve never heard anything from someone who was gone at long as Cassie but I guess a mothers love-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to see my boys.&#34; I croaked. Tears were rolling down my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inching closer Julian crouched down. Bringing up almost level. I stared into his eyes for a second and then looked away. It was too intense looking into his eyes. The eyes of a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go and get them. So you can see them.&#34; He said softly. &#34;They will be excited to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not for long though your highness. She needs rest and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We won&#39;t stay long.&#34; He snapped. &#34;But she wants to see them and they are going to be excited to meet her.&#34; He turned his eye to me with a smile. &#34;You&#39;re doing so well Cassie, and I&#39;m so happy to see you awake and talking. Do you remember what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mutely I nodded. Of course I remembered. I had taken my own life to be with him. And by doing so I had left my babies behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I died.&#34; I whispered. &#34;I left my babies behind and died,&#34; I took a deep breath and then let it out in a steady stream. &#34;But they were fine. They were looked after and protected. People thought I was crazy because I could hear them crying when they weren&#39;t with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged a startled look. A look passing between them that I didn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please may I see my babies.&#34; I whispered. &#34;Just for a second to say goodbye?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodbye?&#34; Julian&#39;s dark eyebrows shot down. &#34;Why would you say goodbye now we have you back?&#34; He seemed genuinely confused and truthfully so was I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked slowly. Cocking my head to the side. &#34;Because I&#39;m dead.&#34; I said in a flat voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not dead Cassie.&#34; The doctor gave a nervous chuckle. &#34;We lost you for a few minutes but your vitals are good now. Some rest, and with a little time you can go home to your family and start to heal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian reached for my hand. His fingers entwined with mine. &#34;You&#39;re not dead Cassie. You are right here. Finally back where you belong. You aren&#39;t dead.&#34; He said again more firmly. &#34;You&#39;re just confused and tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snatched my hand back. Even though his fingers were warm I didn&#39;t want to touch a ghost. Not even one that looked and sounded like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am dead.&#34; I snapped and my eyes flashed. &#34;I took my own life because.&#34; All eyes turned to me in shock. &#34;Because you were dead as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>189</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has gone mad.&#34; Pacing up and down the hospital hallway , I kept throwing pained glances at Cassie&#39;s hospital door. Everything was quiet in there now, so I hoped she was resting. She needed to and when she woke back up hopefully she had her wits about her again because right now she was acting like a crazy person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that at all.&#34; The doctor watched as I continued to pace. Her lined face drawn down in what desperately tried to be a neutral expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spinning on my heel I stared at her. &#34;She thinks I&#39;m dead.&#34; I pointed at her. My voice shook with anger. &#34;Acting like she is seeing a ghost is crazy. Talking about things that aren&#39;t there and have never been there.&#34; I dropped my hand to my side and clenched my fingers into a fist. &#34;She is acting nuts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is confused. I won&#39;t disagree with you on that your highness.&#34; The woman said in a quiet voice. &#34;She was asleep for a long time and from I can gather she dreamt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was dreaming I was dead?&#34; I muttered. &#34;Well that&#39;s just fantastic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor, pushing the top end of middle aged rolled her eyes like a teenager. &#34;She built a fantasy world around her. One where you clearly loved each other because when you died she took her own life.&#34; A frown pinched her eyebrows together. &#34;In her dream anyway.&#34; She added quickly. &#34;What she needs is a little patience and understanding. You will need to gently remind her of your life together before all of this happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My frown deepened. With a groan I fell into one of the spindly plastic chairs that lined the sterile hallway and dropped my head to my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remind my wife of all the good times we had together? That was easier said than done because we hadn&#39;t really had any. I hadn&#39;t been a good husband , not even in the slightest. In fact I had hated and tormented her. Called her slut and many more horrible things. It was only after her accident, that I had started to realise that I might have been wrong. Only she wouldn&#39;t wake up for me to tell her that and make amends. And the stayed unconscious, even as her body swelled with the boys she didn&#39;t wake up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when they were born, and I had realised after the paternity test results had come through and begged her to wake up , she hadn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had messed up so badly and everyone around me knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only I&#39;d never gotten the chance to make it up to her because she hadn&#39;t be awake.  Cassie was awake now and I didn&#39;t know how to go forward. What was a man to say to a woman who had just woken up from a coma?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t blurt out that I was in love with her because after all of these years of marriage I didn&#39;t know if I did love her. We hadn&#39;t gotten the chance to find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly I lifted my head to stare at the doctor who quickly averted her eyes. Blowing out a breath I straightened my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can try.&#34; I said finally. My voice flat. &#34;I don&#39;t know about good memories, but we can maybe start with building new ones.&#34; With a groan I pushed myself to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s all I could do now, try to prove myself to her. Try to rebuild a life that we could have had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate had given me a rare second chance and I wasn&#39;t about to ruin it. My boys deserved to know their mother and I deserved to know if my wife was my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was strange to me that the first time I had felt the bond niggle at me was when I had seen her in the hospital bed. Wired up with a breathing tube down her throat. I was injured myself when they brought her in. But seeing her like that I had been beside myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I only realise she might be the one when she was on deaths door?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something caught my attention. The slightest sound of a door opening and three sets of feet approaching from the stairs at the end of the hallway. Their scent hit me next. Play doh and strawberry milk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she going to be ok with seeing them like this?&#34; I asked the doctor in a quiet voice as the sound of running footsteps got louder. I needed to know how to progress without making Cassie&#39;s madness worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly Julian.&#34; She forgot my honourific but I didn&#39;t reprimand her. She had been Cassie&#39;s doctor for so long now that we were on a first name basis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly I don&#39;t know. We will just have take things slow. In her dreams they are still babies and she&#39;s only been apart from them for a few weeks at most.&#34; She turned as the double doors at the end of the hallway burst open. Rebounding against the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is going to be her first meeting with her children but you have to remember in her mind it&#39;s not. She loves these boys more than anything but we need to go slow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what go slow meant in medical terms but I didn&#39;t have any chance to find out as my sons barrelled towards me. Their chubby cheeks flushed pinks and the ties of their little school uniforms at half mast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Papa.&#34; They called out in unison. Their young voices excited. They were always excited to see me and I was always excited to see them. They were the only things that kept me strong enough to keep going over the last five years since Cassie&#39;s accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crouching down  on the balls of my feet, I opened my arms wide to welcome them. &#34;Hey boys, how was school?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noah stuck out his tongue, just like he always did but Niall answered. &#34;School was fun, we painted dinosaurs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chuckling, I touched the green smudge of paint on his white shirt. &#34;I can see that little man. I can&#39;t wait to see them but I have a surprise for you. A real big one but we have to -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve already told them to be on their best behavior.&#34; A woman&#39;s voice spoke out from along the long corridor and my head lifted sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Miranda?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh I thought it should be me who came and brought them. I am the royal doctor now after all and if the queen is awake then I want to make sure she is getting the best care possible.&#34; Megan said with a smile.</p>
