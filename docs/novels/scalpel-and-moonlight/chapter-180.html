                <p>Julian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kill our baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t have said anything else that would soften my regards to her. Megan deserved everything she got but the baby growing inside her belly, didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If what she said was true anyway. I had every reason to doubt her but for some reason I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met Ian&#39;s eyes and he frowned at me. I knew what he was thinking , what they were all thinking so no one needed to say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping Cassie&#39;s hand , I reached down to heave Megan to her feet. My eyes caught Ian&#39;s startled wide eyed glance and I looked away quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had dropped my mate&#39;s hand for my mistress, that&#39;s what they were thinking but it wasn&#39;t like that. Megan was weak , she was pregnant. She needed someone to show her an ounce of compassion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t mean anything. I just didn&#39;t want to start my reign by being the kind of king who would let a heavily pregnant woman grovel at his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie herself had said that I needed to be better than those who had come before me and I was trying to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie would understand why I had dropped her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting Megan to her feet, I steadied her with my hands light on her shoulders. &#34;No one is going to hurt your or your baby.&#34; I said softly and she lifted her eyes to me. I frowned. She looked different without all the layers of makeup on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even have mascara on , the eyelashes that framed her pale eyes were blonde and stumpy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Julian.&#34; She begged again , this time her hands came down to rest on my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From next to me, I heard Cassie&#39;s startled intake of breath and turned to her before I could stop myself. My eyes beseeching her to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accusation flooded her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why have you come here Megan?&#34; I asked turning my attention back to her. My wife stayed silent. Docile and submissive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made the corners of my mouth twitch there was nothing docile or submissive about Cassie but she wouldn&#39;t make a scene in front of Megan. Alone she would rip me a new one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pictured the hurt look in her eyes and sighed again. Or maybe she wouldn&#39;t. That was a scary thought. When Cassie was quiet she was angry with me and had given up. I wanted her to rip me a new one the moment we were alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To ask for shelter. I don&#39;t have anywhere else to go, Julian.&#34; Megan&#39;s wail brought me back to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you came to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you don&#39;t care for me anymore but our child is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has never cared for you.&#34; Ian spat and I shot him a warning look. This wasn&#39;t helping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what of Duncan?&#34; Cassie&#39;s small voice spoke from just behind my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes flashed towards her and widened in shock. Like it was a surprise to see her standing by my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I escaped him.&#34; Megan made a big show of looking scared. &#34;He was a monster. He hurt people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m more than aware of that but wasn&#39;t he the love of your life. Weren&#39;t you meant to be his queen and rule at his side?&#34; There was venom in Cassie&#39;s voice now. &#34;But then again weren&#39;t you standing by my fathers side as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cassie.&#34; I whispered a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ignored me completely. The two women stared at each other. Like they were facing off before a massive fight and that&#39;s exactly what was going to happen if I let this carry on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cassie had every right to fight, except- my eyes travelled to Megan&#39;s belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And then there was the fact that you tried to steal my husband away from me. Tried to kill my babies-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Megan&#39;s eyes widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned, hadn&#39;t she known?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that all that takes to get you into bed Megan, the promise of power?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had never heard Cassie sound so full of hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your husband was more than willing-&#34; Megan began to retort and I stepped in between the two of them quickly before things got physical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough.&#34; I said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from us Ian shook his head. A clear warning that I was doing the wrong thing. I ignored him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you Julian.&#34; Megan&#39;s hand came down on my arm. Her nails were dirty and grimy. &#34;Thank you for always looking after me and our child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw the grin she aimed at my wife before she tried to hide it. This was a game for Megan. Another one. I was a fool to believe for a second that she was here for any other reason than to try and sow discord between me and Cassie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I had let her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me.&#34; Not waiting for a reply, Cassie turned on her heels and walked away. Her back straight and her long dark hair swishing down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank the goddess she has gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whirled on Megan. Gripping her cheeks in one hand and squeezing until her eyes widened in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do not get to address my queen that way. Not now and not ever.&#34; I spat. &#34;You will treat her with respect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes Julian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes your highness I didn&#39;t mean- please forgive me.&#34; She stuttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t fooled. She couldn&#39;t pull the wool over my eyes. Not anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had Cassie said about lies? I saw straight through all of Megan&#39;s now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scarlett can you find Megan some clean clothes and warm food and -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The alpha stepped forward. &#34;I&#39;ll see to it that she has a secure comfortable room and the things she needs. I won&#39;t let you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. Thank you. I just have one thing to do and then I will come and question her some more. Ian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll stand guard Julian.&#34; My second said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew he would and that&#39;s why I asked him. I didn&#39;t trust anyone else. I wouldn&#39;t have let Megan out of my sight because she was clearly up to something but-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around I rushed out of the room and after my mates retreating back. &#34;Cassie please stop.&#34;</p>
