                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Ian , covered in sweat and something that looked like smears of black oil hesitated in the open doorway. &#34;Where are the boys?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing up from my place on the sofa with my laptop balanced precariously on my lap I smiled. &#34;Bathed and in bed. There&#39;s dinner in the oven for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving me a wide smile he kicked off his shoes he moved towards the kitchen area. &#34;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m late there was-&#34; he paused. &#34;What did you cook?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing in closed the lid of the laptop and turned to him. Curling my legs underneath me. &#34;I&#39;m better at cooking now.&#34; I pointed out and I was. Yanna and her family had been giving me lessons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I was just asking.&#34; He retorted. &#34;You know I&#39;ll eat whatever you try to cook for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help it l laughed. The main word in that sentence was try because I might be getting better but I still wasn&#39;t good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know but that&#39;s Yannas cooking not mine. I just heated it up because I didn&#39;t want another take out. I&#39;m starting to put on weight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his head in the oven Ian made an appreciative sound. &#34;Good you could do with putting on some weight.&#34; He reappeared again. Plate in hand as he came to sit opposite me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was such a mundane thing. Eating and chatting with each other every evening after work that I had begun to think it  was normal. And for any other family it probably was but we weren&#39;t a normal family and I&#39;d never had anything like this growing up or with Julian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I liked it though. I enjoyed our after work conversations and the fact he was hands on with the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what are you doing?&#34; He waggled his eyebrows. &#34;Best not be cheating on me with random guys online.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter burst from my lips. &#34;Yeah cos dating is top of my to do list.&#34; Rolling my eyes I watched him eat and in return he stared at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One day it will be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was was something in the way he said it that made me pause. &#34;If you want to date you can Ian. We are only pretending to be a couple ,remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a deer in the headlights he stared at me and then shook his head. &#34;No Cassie.&#34; He said softly. &#34;We have to make this lie believable so I have to make it look like I&#39;m crazy about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; I rolled my eyes. &#34;But the offer is there. You could do it if you were careful. And there&#39;s plenty of pretty women around here. Like Yanna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian&#39;s face closed down instantly. &#34;Not happening Cassie. Now tell me what you are doing?&#34; He pointed to the laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m making us some more money. With you working whatever jobs you can get and me only having part time hours in the doctors office around the children , I thought we could do with some extra.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;You&#39;re making money online?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a few seconds to understand his shock and horror but once I did I couldn&#39;t help it I laughed. &#34;Not like that.&#34; Tossing a cushion at him I laughed even louder. &#34;There&#39;s a website, a few of them actually that employ doctors to give advice online. I looked into it when I was first married and Julian took my job away from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh ok. No wait.&#34; Ian&#39;s eyes flashed. &#34;If he knows about these sites he might-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t, Ian. We ended up arguing because he thought I was cheating. I doubt he even remembers it happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ok,&#34; Ian scraped the last of his food from his plate and into his mouth. &#34;Sounds like a good idea but are you sure you want to work in the evenings as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing I nodded. I had thought about that. At the moment I had a good work -life balance because I worked around the kids&#39; school day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, that&#39;s the beauty of these sites. I can work the hours I want, just by signing in. And there&#39;s really not much for me to do after the boys are in bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ian&#39;s face darkened. &#34;I&#39;ve been leaving you alone too much. I should take you out or something. I know how hard it is being in a new place. Especially when you can&#39;t make close friends and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut him off. &#34;You don&#39;t need to take me out Ian. You&#39;ve done too much already. If you want to head out one night then I&#39;d love to tag along but honestly I&#39;m not doing this because I&#39;m lonely. I&#39;m doing this because I&#39;m a doctor and I want to be useful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I get that.&#34; He said softly. &#34;And if it&#39;s something you will enjoy and it won&#39;t jeopardise your safety then I am fully behind it. You are a good doctor and it makes you happy so why not.&#34; He gave a small shrug and stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks. I&#39;ve already registered my account so I can sign in and start helping people whenever I&#39;m ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well no time like now hey? I need to shower and have an early night anyway.&#34; His eyes appraised me. &#34;Unless you need me for anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go and shower Ian. You look tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks flamed. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean it like that Ian. You&#39;re the best fake husband and father a woman could wish for. One day you will make a spectacular mate and father to a lucky lady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the life for me and anyway I have you and the boys now. Not exactly a great set up to meet anyone.&#34; He headed up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unless you have already met her.&#34; I muttered under my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty five minutes later I had logged into the platform and was just finishing up a consultation when someone joined the queue to speak to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was good, easy money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing down the window, I clicked on the next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrolling through the patient notes I frowned , a wave of unease flowing through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi I&#39;m doctor Cassandra. How can I help you today?&#34; I typed quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three dots appeared. &#34;Cassandra? Do people call you Cassie or Cass?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People call me Cassandra. How can I help you?&#34; Rule number one of dealing with online patients was not to get too friendly. Some of them forgot that it was a professional relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t mean to overstep. I really do need your help. You see, this is kind of embarrassing but I think I&#39;m dying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you symptoms? If you can quickly go through them then I can tell you the best course of action or phone for the paramedics if you need one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The typed reply took much longer, almost like he was typing and then deleting whole paragraphs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally his message popped up. &#34;The love of my life left me, and I can feel her rejection and it&#39;s breaking my heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the words for a second and willed my heart to calm down. &#34;I&#39;m sorry to hear that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His response was instant. &#34;Are you Cassie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my heart slammed into my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, no,no</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slammed the lid of the laptop down and threw the thing to the other end of the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian had found me.</p>
