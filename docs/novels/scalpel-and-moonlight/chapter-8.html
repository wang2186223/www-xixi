                <p>Cassie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stumbling forward I fell into the wicker seat and reached for the wine. Pouring myself a glass before downing half of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the entire time my eyes were on the stack of papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All it would take was me picking up the pen he had laid on top and signing a few papers and I would be free. This would all be behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And goddess I wanted that. I wanted this all to be over so I could go back to my real life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except deep down I knew it would never ever be the way it used to be. My father&#39;s cruel words echoed in my mind. He wasn&#39;t joking when he had said he would pull the funding from my mother&#39;s care if I messed this up. In that regard, he was a man of his word and there was no way I could afford her medical bills alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t make that much money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shuddering I took another sip of the clear golden liquid. Letting it settle on my tongue before I swallowed it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was I going to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Typical.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes darted up to meet his and the look of open hostility made me choke on my own saliva. Why did it look like he hated me? There was so much anger and dislike in his dark eyes that I paled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should have known you were just like the rest of your family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My own anger bubbled up to meet his. So hot that my voice shook. &#34;What exactly does that mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what I mean Cassie. From all accounts, you&#39;re a clever woman.&#34; He retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained silent. Yeah, I knew what he was getting at but I wanted him to say it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re family are filth! Money grabbing filth and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rose up from his chair. Knocking the table so the papers, wine and my purse clattered to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re family are money grabbing nobodies.&#34; He spat, the disgust clear on his face and in his voice. &#34;And you&#39;re no different are you? Why would you think I would want to stay married to a woman-&#34; He trailed off, his eyes on the spilled contents of my bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing what he was looking at I made a grab for it but he got there first. Picking up the vial he glared at it. Turning it over and over in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing..&#34; I made another grab for it. My fingertips touched his but he closed his hand around it and moved it out of my reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please Julian,&#34; I begged. Maybe if I was nice, maybe if I begged and was submissive like a good she wolf should be then he would give it back. I had completely forgotten it was still in my bag. &#34;It&#39;s private.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dark eyebrows shot down, knotting over his brow and a low growl rumbled up his chest and out of his full lips. I&#39;d never had any man but my father growled at me before. My father had scared me as a child but Julian&#39;s growl terrified me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And turned me on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realised and hated myself. Him being all growly and alpha male was really getting my wolf going. She whined in need and it slipped from my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goddess, Sometimes I hated my wolf. She was the complete opposite of me. She wanted to submit. And what was worse she wanted to submit to him. The beast I was married to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The damn Lycan Prince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But prince or not what he had in his hands was my private property and he would give it back. I had rights even though I was his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give it back to me. Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ignored me completely. Staring down at the vial he read the tiny label out loud. His voice grew angrier and angrier.  &#34;Take within seventy two hours.&#34; His eyes lowered to mine. &#34;This is-&#34; his voice rumbled through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s contraceptives.&#34; Slowly he dropped his hand to his side. Closing his fist around it. &#34;And it was issued not that long ago. So you have been unfaithful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started shaking my head but I couldn&#39;t deny it because it was true. I had gone against the vows that bound me to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When did this happen? When did you sleep around?&#34; Like he had plucked the date from my head like a mind reader. He continued. &#34;The night or day of our wedding? That&#39;s when wasn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never wanted to marry you,&#34; I whispered before I could stop myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a roar, he took the nearest thing to him. The wine glass he had been drinking from and threw it. It smashed on the floor, showing my feet with tiny shards of crystal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whore.&#34; He screamed into my face. His spit hitting my face and I could do nothing but take it. My whole body shaking with fear and anger. &#34;You&#39;re a money grabbing whore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stalked away and I didn&#39;t move until I heard the front door slam shut. It was only then that the tears came.  Falling to my knees I began to pick up the broken crystal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me do that Cassie,&#34; Cathy said from behind me. I shook my head, not trusting myself to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on sweet girl.&#34; Tenderly with her hands under my elbows, she lifted me back into my seat and pushed my wine glass into my hands. &#34;Have a drink and take a deep breath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did what she asked me to do like a robot. It was like I couldn&#39;t think straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had gone from bad to worse so quickly that I didn&#39;t quite know what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not a bad man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked down at her, her words pulling me out of the shock that was freezing me in place. Not that bad? I didn&#39;t know how she could say that with a straight face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian wasn&#39;t just a bad man, he was a monster. A beast with no self control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t stay married to a man like that. Not even to keep my mother safe and comfortable. I would have to find another way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean it, Cassie. He&#39;s not -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and stepped passed her. I&#39;d heard enough. &#34;I&#39;m going to my room. Thank you for clearing the glass up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me prepare you some dinner and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not very hungry right now but thank you. I think I&#39;ll just spend the evening in my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed alone time because I needed to find a way to get out of this marriage so I never had to see that man ever again.</p>
