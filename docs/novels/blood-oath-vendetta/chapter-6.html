                <p>Isabella Pov</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air in the safe house felt heavier than before, weighed down by tension and unanswered questions. I sat on the sleek leather couch, staring blankly at the coffee table. My hands trembled slightly as I twisted the edge of my jacket between my fingers. The events of the night replayed in my mind like a broken record, and no matter how much I tried to piece them together, they refused to make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo&#39;s voice echoed in my head: &#34;If he&#39;s innocent, why would he run? And if he&#39;s guilty, what&#39;s his endgame?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither possibility made me feel any better. If Tony had betrayed us, it meant everything we thought we knew about loyalty and trust was a lie. If he was innocent, then someone was playing us all-and they were doing a damn good job of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo was pacing near the window, his movements restless, agitated. He hadn&#39;t spoken much since the call about Tony. I could feel his anger simmering just beneath the surface, ready to explode at any moment. I wanted to say something, anything, to ease the weight pressing down on both of us, but I couldn&#39;t find the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he stopped and turned to me, his dark eyes piercing. &#34;We need to figure out where Tony is, Bella. If he&#39;s working with Marco and the Morettis-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Or if he&#39;s not,&#34; I interjected softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;Or if he&#39;s not,&#34; he conceded. &#34;But either way, we can&#39;t move forward until we know the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made sense, but they did little to calm the storm inside me. The truth. That was the crux of it all, wasn&#39;t it? Everyone seemed to have their own version of it, and right now, I didn&#39;t know who or what to believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood and began pacing the room, mirroring Enzo&#39;s earlier movements. &#34;What if this is exactly what they want? Whoever&#39;s behind this-they&#39;re setting us up to turn on each other. First the note, then the ambush, now Tony disappearing&#34; I shook my head, my frustration boiling over. &#34;It&#39;s too convenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo watched me, his gaze unreadable. &#34;You think someone&#39;s playing us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t just think it,&#34; I snapped, my voice rising. &#34;I know it. This whole thing feels like a trap, and we&#39;re walking right into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crossed his arms, his expression thoughtful. &#34;If you&#39;re right, then the question is: who&#39;s pulling the strings? Marco? The Morettis? Someone else entirely?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. I didn&#39;t have an answer, and that terrified me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo sighed and ran a hand through his hair, the frustration clear in his every movement. &#34;We don&#39;t have time to second-guess everything. Tony&#39;s disappearance changes everything. We need to move fast before we lose our chance to get ahead of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded reluctantly, knowing he was right. As much as I hated the idea of rushing into the unknown, we didn&#39;t have a choice. Whoever was behind this wasn&#39;t going to wait for us to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo pulled out his phone and made a quick call, his voice low and clipped as he gave instructions. I couldn&#39;t make out every word, but I caught enough to know he was mobilizing some of our men to start tracking Tony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he hung up, he turned back to me. &#34;We&#39;ll head out in ten minutes. Pack light. We can&#39;t afford to stay here any longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t argue. The safe house, with its sterile walls and cold design, felt anything but safe now. I grabbed my bag and began stuffing it with the essentials, my mind racing as I tried to anticipate what was coming next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes later, we were back in the elevator, descending into the underground garage. My heart was pounding, a steady drumbeat of anxiety that refused to let up. I could feel Enzo&#39;s tension beside me, his silence more telling than any words he could have spoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the elevator doors slid open, I froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow moved in the far corner of the garage, just out of reach of the overhead lights. My breath hitched as my eyes locked onto the figure stepping forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was him. The man who had saved us at the Viper&#39;s Den.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay behind me,&#34; Enzo ordered, his voice a low growl. He moved in front of me, his body taut and ready for a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man raised his hands in a gesture of peace, though the smirk on his face suggested anything but. &#34;Relax,&#34; he said, his voice smooth and unbothered. &#34;If I wanted to hurt you, I wouldn&#39;t have saved you earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I demanded, stepping out from behind Enzo despite his warning glare. My fear was quickly being replaced by anger. This man had been pulling the strings all night, and I was done being kept in the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone who&#39;s on your side,&#34; he replied cryptically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not an answer,&#34; Enzo snapped, his fists clenching at his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s smirk widened. &#34;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s all you&#39;re going to get for now. But trust me, you&#39;ll thank me later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped closer, my hands balled into fists. &#34;You expect us to trust you? After everything you&#39;ve done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I&#39;ve done,&#34; he echoed, his tone suddenly sharper. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t stepped in, you&#39;d both be dead. Or did you forget about the little welcome party Marco and the Morettis had waiting for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words stung, mostly because they were true. Still, that didn&#39;t mean I was ready to trust him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked, my voice hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To help you,&#34; he said simply. &#34;Whether you believe me or not, we&#39;re on the same side. And if you want to survive what&#39;s coming, you&#39;re going to need me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo scoffed. &#34;We don&#39;t need anyone but ourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man chuckled, a low, almost mocking sound. &#34;You&#39;re wrong. But you&#39;ll figure that out soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before either of us could respond, he turned and disappeared into the shadows as quickly as he had appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared after him, my mind spinning. Enzo swore under his breath, his anger barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t trust him,&#34; he said firmly, his eyes still scanning the garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I agreed. &#34;But we can&#39;t ignore him either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo didn&#39;t respond, but the tension in his jaw told me he was thinking the same thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we climbed into the car and drove away from the safe house, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that we had just crossed an invisible line-one we couldn&#39;t come back from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And whoever that man was, he held all the cards.</p>
