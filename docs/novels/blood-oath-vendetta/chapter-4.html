                <p>****Isabella&#39;s POV:****</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension hung like a dense fog between Enzo and me ever since we left Nico&#39;s bar. The city&#39;s darkness seemed indifferent to the secrets and savage alliances simmering beneath its surface. As I gazed out the window, my mind raced with questions-whom could I trust, and what was Marco really up to? The evidence we found in his apartment revealed that the problem was far bigger and deadlier than I had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really sure we should head to the estate, after all?&#34; I ventured, breaking the silence between us. &#34;What if the mole is someone close to us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo tensed beside me, his hands gripping the steering wheel tightly. I could see the frustration in his clenched jaw. &#34;*Bella*,&#34; he said, his voice controlled but strained, &#34;we need to go back. We must confront Tony. He&#39;s been with us for years, but if there&#39;s even a minor chance he betrayed us, we need to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, but the thought of accusing Tony, someone like family, made my stomach churn. &#34;And what if he&#39;s innocent?&#34; I asked quietly, almost to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we&#39;ll know who the traitor really is,&#34; Enzo replied grimly. &#34;But we can&#39;t take any chances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The estate loomed ahead, its dark silhouette a quiet reminder of the power and danger the Romano family embodied. The closer we got to its front doors, the more I felt an icy chill run down my spine, as if the walls themselves were watching us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the atmosphere was no less tense. The usual hustle and bustle had subsided, replaced by wary glances between servants and guards. The explosion and subsequent ambush had left everyone shaken, and trust was now a rare commodity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Tony?&#34; Enzo demanded as soon as we stepped into the main hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A guard stepped forward, bowing his head respectfully. &#34;He&#39;s in the study, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo nodded sharply and headed toward the study with long, determined strides. I followed, my heart pounding. As he pushed open the heavy wooden doors, we found Tony sitting behind his desk, a deep frown etched into his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enzo, Bella, what&#39;s going on?&#34; Tony asked, rising to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo didn&#39;t waste any time. &#34;An ambush, Tony. It was a tip-off. We think there might be a mole in the family, and we need to be sure if it&#39;s you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony&#39;s eyes widened in shock. He jumped from his seat, fists clenched. &#34;Are you kidding me?&#34; he growled. &#34;Betray you after all we&#39;ve been through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anger in his voice made me wince, but I held my ground. &#34;Tony, we don&#39;t want to believe it, but we have to consider every possibility,&#34; I said, trying to keep my voice steady. &#34;If it&#39;s not you, then we need your help to find out who it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony&#39;s gaze shifted from Enzo to me, his face a mix of hurt and anger. &#34;I&#39;ve bled for this family, *Bella*. I would never betray you. Never.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then prove it,&#34; Enzo said coldly. &#34;Help us find the real traitor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a few tense seconds, the room was silent. The tension crackled like electricity before Tony finally nodded, his voice quiet but resolute. &#34;I will find out who it is,&#34; he said. &#34;And when I do, they&#39;ll pay for what they&#39;ve done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled a breath I hadn&#39;t realized I was holding. I wanted to believe Tony, to trust that he was still on our side. But doubt gnawed at my insides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Tony,&#34; I said softly. &#34;We&#39;re counting on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony&#39;s nod was sharp, his eyes still blazing with anger. &#34;You can count on me, *Bella*,&#34; he growled. &#34;I will get to the bottom of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we left the study, a heavy weight settled on my shoulders. I glanced at Enzo, lost in thought, his brow furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you believe him?&#34; I asked quietly as we walked down the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo didn&#39;t answer immediately. &#34;I want to,&#34; he finally admitted. &#34;But we can&#39;t take anything at face value anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, my heart sinking further. &#34;What&#39;s our move now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We keep looking,&#34; Enzo stated firmly. &#34;There&#39;s something else going on, and it&#39;s time we dropped in on one of my old associates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours passed, and then, incredibly, came an unfathomable clue. It was very brief-just two words on a crumpled note slipped under the door to my apartment: *The answers you seek are at The Viper&#39;s Den.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart raced as I read the note. I had heard of The Viper&#39;s Den before, an exceedingly dangerous and secretive underground mafia club. This meant Marco was involved in something much more sinister than I had anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew I couldn&#39;t ignore the tip, but I also knew it was far too risky to go alone. I found Enzo in the library, deep in discussion with one of the guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enzo,&#34; I interrupted, shoving the note into his view. &#34;We have to go to The Viper&#39;s Den.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The note made his eyes narrow, his face darkening. &#34;Who sent this?&#34; he asked sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, but this might be our only lead,&#34; I replied, urgency creeping into my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo cursed under his breath. &#34;This is too dangerous, *Bella*,&#34; he said. &#34;That place is a death trap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re coming with me,&#34; I insisted, my tone leaving no room for argument. &#34;We need to find out what Marco was planning, and this could be the key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo hesitated for a moment, then relented with a curt nod. &#34;Alright,&#34; he agreed, his voice firm. &#34;But we do it my way. We go in, get the information, and get out. No risks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Agreed,&#34; I said, feeling a wave of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We dressed quickly, knowing time was of the essence. The drive to The Viper&#39;s Den was silent, tension thick in the air. The club was in a part of town most people avoided, in the basement of an abandoned warehouse. The entrance was guarded by a hulking man who eyed us suspiciously as we approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re here to see someone,&#34; Enzo told him, slipping him a wad of cash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard grunted and stepped aside, allowing us to pass. My heart raced as we descended the narrow staircase into the club. The air was thick with smoke and the smell of alcohol, the dim light casting dancing shadows on the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay close,&#34; Enzo murmured, his hand brushing against mine as we pushed through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, my senses on high alert. The patrons were a rough-looking lot, men and women who exuded danger. I kept my head down, avoiding eye contact as we made our way to a secluded corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There,&#34; Enzo whispered, nodding toward a booth where two men were deep in conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath caught in my throat as I recognized one of the men-Alessandro Moretti, a high-ranking member of the Moretti family. And the othermy heart almost stopped as I realized who it was-Marco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s working with the Morettis,&#34; I whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Enzo muttered. &#34;We need to figure out what they&#39;re planning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We inched closer, trying to catch their conversation, but the noise of the club swallowed most of it. I strained to hear, catching bits about a &#34;double-cross&#34; and &#34;taking out the Romanos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, one of them looked up, his eyes narrowing at us. My heart leaped into my throat as Alessandro rose to his feet, his hand slipping inside his jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re blown,&#34; Enzo hissed, grabbing my arm. &#34;We need to get out of here. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We turned to leave but were blocked by a line of Moretti goons, their faces twisted into evil grins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have we here?&#34; Alessandro drawled, sneering as he approached. &#34;Spying on us, eh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged through me. We were trapped, cornered. Before I could react, a figure appeared behind Alessandro like a ghost, delivering a precise blow to his head. Alessandro crumpled to the ground, unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tall figure turned toward us, his face hidden in shadow. &#34;Go,&#34; he ordered, his voice low and urgent. &#34;Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo didn&#39;t need to be told twice. He dragged me toward the exit, shoving aside anyone who got in our way. The mysterious figure fought off the thugs, creating an opening for us to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We burst through the doors into the cold night air, gasping for breath. My heart was racing, adrenaline pumping through my veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was that?&#34; I gasped.</p>
