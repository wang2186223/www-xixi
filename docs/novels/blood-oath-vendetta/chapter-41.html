                <p>(Enzo&#39;s POV)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull, persistent ache pulsed through my body, but I shoved it aside the second my gaze met his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo Callahan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the reason I had scars. The reason I had learned to survive. And now, the reason I had to fight for my life once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried himself like nothing in this world could touch him, a quiet arrogance in every movement. His tailored suit remained crisp, his posture relaxed, as if he was greeting an old friend instead of a man he had once left for dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed the bitterness rising in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had potential, Enzo,&#34; Lorenzo said, his tone almost fond. &#34;But you always let your emotions get in the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my breathing steady as the room tightened around me. Syndicate enforcers had closed in, blocking every exit. Their fingers hovered near triggers, waiting for the smallest excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo took another slow step toward me, his polished shoes tapping against the concrete. &#34;We can skip the theatrics. You know how this ends. Surrender now, and I&#39;ll make sure you keep breathing. If you resist&#34; His head tilted slightly. &#34;Well, let&#39;s not be dramatic. We both know what happens next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach churned, but I didn&#39;t let it show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t trust a damn word you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s lips curled into a knowing smirk. &#34;No? Then perhaps you&#39;ll believe what I tell you next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pause that followed was deliberate, a cruel moment stretched just long enough to make the anticipation unbearable. Then, with all the ease of discussing an insignificant memory, he spoke a name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isabella&#39;s brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart slammed against my ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single second felt like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard Isabella&#39;s sharp breath. Felt the shift in the air as her entire world tilted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then the real damage began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(Isabella&#39;s POV)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit like a blade straight to the chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had carried the weight of my brother&#39;s death for months. I had grieved, I had raged, and I had lived with the knowledge that the Morettis had stolen him from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lorenzo&#39;s voice held none of the expected deceit. He spoke with certainty as if he was revealing a long-hidden truth rather than spinning a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Morettis had nothing to do with his death,&#34; Lorenzo continued, his voice measured, each syllable dragging across my skin like barbed wire. &#34;It was the Syndicate that took his life. And Enzo?&#34; He exhaled lightly, a mockery of sympathy. &#34;He played his role in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world around me dulled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Enzo, my pulse hammering in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me it isn&#39;t true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tensed, his breathing shallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t deny it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence between us stretched, turning colder, heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow pit opened in my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had trusted him. Fought beside him. Believed in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo watched me, amusement flickering in his gaze. &#34;There it is,&#34; he murmured as if savoring the unraveling. &#34;That moment when everything you thought you knew starts to fall apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gritted my teeth, forcing my voice to steady. &#34;You&#39;re trying to turn me against him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo gave a small, effortless shrug. &#34;I don&#39;t have to. You already feel it, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to acknowledge the seed of doubt that had been planted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(Enzo&#39;s POV)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The betrayal in Isabella&#39;s expression gutted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not the fury-anger, I could handle. I had seen rage in a hundred different forms: from enemies, from those I had betrayed, and from the people I had left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hurt behind her eyes?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That nearly knocked the breath from my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to explain. To tell her the truth that had been buried for years. But this wasn&#39;t the place, and it certainly wasn&#39;t the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo had orchestrated this perfectly. He had planted the seeds, then stood back, watching them grow, reveling in the destruction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See?&#34; he mused, pacing leisurely. &#34;No matter how much you try to escape it, Enzo, your past will always catch up to you. Even the ones closest to you will never truly stand by your side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew where this was going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo wasn&#39;t here to kill me outright. He was here to break me first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t let him win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scanned the room, calculating the risks. The Syndicate&#39;s men were on edge, fingers ready to pull triggers at a moment&#39;s notice. If I made the wrong move, I&#39;d be dead before I could take my next breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t have a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I hesitated, we were done for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So I moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the closest soldier could react, I lunged. My fingers closed around the grip of his gun, twisting it free from his hands before he had time to process what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shot echoed through the warehouse like a crack of thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything exploded into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gunfire erupted from all directions, shouts mixing with the deafening noise of bullets ricocheting off steel and concrete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely had time to react before something-or someone-slammed into me from the side. My grip on the weapon nearly slipped as I staggered, but I kept my feet beneath me, forcing myself forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for Isabella, grabbing her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stiffened at my touch. That hesitation-that pain-was still there. But we didn&#39;t have the luxury of standing still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move!&#34; I barked, yanking her forward as we raced toward the nearest exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julian was already ahead, returning fire with sharp precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lorenzo&#39;s voice cut through the chaos, calm and unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had seconds before the warehouse became our tomb.</p>
