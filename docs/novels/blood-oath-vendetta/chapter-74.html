                <p>The file lay open between them, its pages thick with information that could shatter everything Enzo thought he knew. Vince&#39;s calm demeanor was almost maddening as if the weight of this revelation didn&#39;t faze him. But for Enzo, it was as if the ground beneath him had cracked open, exposing a chasm of secrets and lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, eyes scanning each page. The names, the connections, the hidden alliances. They weren&#39;t just playing a game here; they were caught in something much darker. The enemy, a shadow organization, had been pulling the strings behind the chaos of the mafia wars. Every death, every betrayal-it all led back to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince watched him closely, his posture relaxed but his eyes sharp, reading Enzo&#39;s every reaction. &#34;You didn&#39;t think I was just hunting you, did you?&#34; he said, the words laced with something darker, more dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo&#39;s mind raced as he flipped through the pages, his heartbeat thudding in his ears. The pieces began to fit together in a way that made his stomach turn. This was never just about power. It was revenge, a long game orchestrated by someone who had been in the shadows for far too long. They had pulled Vince into this storm, just as they had pulled him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are they?&#34; Enzo muttered, barely able to contain the weight of the question. He could feel the walls closing in, the knowledge that whoever controlled this game was always one step ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;You&#39;ve already met them. You just didn&#39;t know it yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sick feeling twisted in Enzo&#39;s gut. He thought he understood the stakes, but now it seemed like the ground beneath him was slipping, disappearing entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been hunting them, Vince? This whole time?&#34; Enzo&#39;s voice barely rose above a whisper, his shock mixing with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince didn&#39;t answer immediately. Instead, he leaned back in his chair, his expression unreadable. &#34;I have my own reasons for going after them. But it&#39;s bigger than just me, Enzo.&#34; He paused, locking eyes with him. &#34;It&#39;s bigger than both of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tense silence filled the room. Enzo&#39;s heart thundered in his chest as the magnitude of what Vince was saying sank in. These weren&#39;t just enemies-they were ghosts, manipulating everything from the shadows. And Vince wasn&#39;t just playing his own game. He was hunting something far more dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t come here to play games,&#34; Enzo finally said, his voice steady despite the fire raging in his chest. &#34;So, tell me-what&#39;s the next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s eyes flashed a mix of determination and something else-something darker-swimming beneath the surface. &#34;You can help me,&#34; he said slowly, each word heavy with meaning. &#34;Or you can get out of my way. But make no mistake, Enzo: I&#39;ll burn everything down to find them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the air like a challenge, each syllable dripping with intent. Enzo could feel the weight of the decision press down on him, every instinct telling him to walk away, to leave this madness behind. But something kept him in place, something deeper than logic or reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to speak, but no words came. Instead, he nodded slowly. They both knew this fight was bigger than either of them. And if Vince was going to burn everything down, Enzo wasn&#39;t going to let him do it alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s next words hit like a punch to the gut, throwing Enzo off-balance for a moment. &#34;Isabella,&#34; he said, voice low, almost pained. &#34;She&#39;s in danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo&#39;s breath caught in his throat, and his heart skipped a beat. He had known something was coming, but this-this was something else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t lie to me,&#34; Enzo growled, his body tensing at the mere mention of her name. His mind spun as images of Isabella flashed before him-her smile, her touch, the way she always knew how to calm the storm inside him. The idea that she was in danger twisted something inside him, something raw and desperate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince met his gaze, unwavering. &#34;I&#39;m not lying. She&#39;s been targeted. And not by who you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo&#39;s fists clenched at his sides. &#34;Tell me everything,&#34; he said, the edge in his voice unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s being used as leverage,&#34; Vince continued, his tone colder than before. &#34;Against you. They want you to make a choice, Enzo-work with me to take down the real enemy, or lose her forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the air like a death sentence, and Enzo&#39;s pulse quickened. Isabella wasn&#39;t just a pawn-she was the target, the catalyst. Vince&#39;s words cut deeper than any blade ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo could feel the weight of the decision pressing on him, suffocating him. He had always known this world was dangerous, but to have someone he loved dragged into this? It was a nightmare he couldn&#39;t escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of uncertainty crossed Vince&#39;s face, but it was gone before Enzo could grasp it. &#34;You have a choice,&#34; Vince repeated, his voice hardening. &#34;You can help me, or you can walk away. But if you walk away, Isabella won&#39;t make it out alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air between them seemed to crackle with tension. Enzo&#39;s mind raced, his heart pounding in his chest. His instincts screamed at him to find Isabella, to get her out of harm&#39;s way, but the path ahead was dark, full of uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could respond, his phone vibrated in his pocket. Enzo&#39;s fingers tightened around the device as he pulled it free, his heart stopping when he saw the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A live feed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was unconscious, her body limp, trapped in some dark, unfamiliar place. Her eyes were closed, and the image made Enzo&#39;s blood run cold. Whoever had her didn&#39;t care who he was. They only cared about what he would do to save her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath came in sharp, uneven bursts. He could feel the rage boiling inside him, threatening to consume him whole. They had her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, they were going to make him pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince stood, his eyes searching Enzo&#39;s face. &#34;You can&#39;t do this alone. You need me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo&#39;s fists were clenched so tight his knuckles were white. He didn&#39;t want to admit it, but Vince was right. He needed Vince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that didn&#39;t mean he had to like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air was palpable as Enzo and Vince stood side by side in the cold, dimly lit room. Their alliance-fragile as it was-had been forged in desperation, and now there was no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s expression was hard, focused. &#34;We have to move fast,&#34; he said, his voice sharp. &#34;The clock&#39;s ticking. Every second we waste, Isabella slips further from our grasp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo nodded, his mind already spinning with plans. He had never been one to wait for things to unfold. He needed action, and he needed it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them worked quickly, gathering intel and tracking down every lead they could find. Time was their enemy. And every minute that passed felt like a weight on Enzo&#39;s chest, pressing down harder, suffocating him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s phone buzzed, pulling him out of the haze of concentration. He glanced at the screen, his eyes narrowing as he read the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re moving her,&#34; Vince said, his voice tense. &#34;They want something in exchange.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo&#39;s hands clenched at his sides, his teeth gritted. He didn&#39;t care what they wanted. He was going to get Isabella back-no matter the cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is she?&#34; Enzo demanded, his heart racing as he stepped toward Vince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince didn&#39;t hesitate. He tossed the phone to Enzo, who immediately scanned the map on the screen. The location was distant, hidden in a maze of backstreets. But the address meant nothing now. Time was running out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo could feel the weight of the world on his shoulders, but he wouldn&#39;t stop. He couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s voice broke through his thoughts. &#34;They&#39;ll never let her go alive, Enzo. You know that, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit like a slap. Enzo&#39;s gaze shot to Vince&#39;s face, searching for any hint of doubt. But there was none. Vince wasn&#39;t warning him; he was telling him the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo&#39;s heart raced, the adrenaline surging through his veins. &#34;I&#39;m not leaving her,&#34; he growled. &#34;I&#39;ll make them regret ever touching her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s eyes glinted with something dangerous. &#34;Then we move quickly. No mistakes. We&#39;re on their turf now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo nodded, the taste of steel in his mouth. This wasn&#39;t just a rescue mission anymore. This was war.</p>
