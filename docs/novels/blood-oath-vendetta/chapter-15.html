                <p>(POV: Enzo)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the farmhouse was a living thing, coiled tight and ready to strike. We had been running on borrowed time for too long, and I could feel it slipping through our fingers like grains of sand. Everyone was on edge, but I never expected the knife to come from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carlo&#39;s hideout wasn&#39;t much-rotting wood, creaking floorboards, and a pervasive dampness that clung to everything. But it was enough for now. The others sat scattered around the room, trying to make sense of Tony&#39;s fragmented warnings. Vince stood apart from us, his arms crossed and his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tony said the mole was close to the Romanos,&#34; Isabella said, her voice low but urgent. She sat next to Tony, who had fallen into a restless sleep. &#34;He overheard something. We need to figure out who it is before they destroy us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easier said than done,&#34; Vince muttered from his corner. &#34;You think the mole is going to announce themselves? They&#39;ve probably been playing us this whole time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you&#39;ve been doing?&#34; I shot back, my frustration spilling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vince&#39;s head snapped up, and his eyes met mine. For a moment, I thought he might deny it, might lash out. But then he just smiled-a cold, humorless thing that sent a chill down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I&#39;m the mole,&#34; he said, his tone almost amused. &#34;That&#39;s rich.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you blame me?&#34; I countered, stepping closer. &#34;You&#39;ve been acting suspicious since the start. And now Tony&#39;s warning-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tony doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about,&#34; Vince interrupted, his voice rising. &#34;He&#39;s half-dead and delirious. You&#39;re all so quick to point fingers, but you don&#39;t know anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Isabella&#39;s voice cut through the argument, sharp and commanding. She stood, her gaze sweeping over both of us. &#34;This isn&#39;t helping. We need to focus on what Tony told us and figure out what the Morettis are planning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists, forcing myself to step back. She was right-this wasn&#39;t the time for infighting. But the doubt lingered, a dark cloud I couldn&#39;t shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(POV: Isabella)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room felt like it was suffocating me. Everyone&#39;s tempers were frayed, and I could see the cracks forming in our fragile alliance. Tony&#39;s warnings replayed in my mind, his voice weak but insistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The mole is close to the Romanos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Vince, standing in the shadows like a man with too many secrets. Enzo&#39;s suspicion was written all over his face, but I couldn&#39;t ignore the small voice in the back of my mind that told me Vince wasn&#39;t the only one hiding something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe we need to step back,&#34; I said, trying to keep my voice steady. &#34;We&#39;re all exhausted, and jumping to conclusions won&#39;t help us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not jumping to conclusions,&#34; Enzo said, his tone hard. &#34;I&#39;m looking at the facts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the facts are incomplete,&#34; Carlo interjected from his spot by the fireplace. His expression was unreadable, but there was a flicker of something in his eyes-something that made my stomach twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you tell us what you know, Carlo?&#34; I asked, my voice sharper than I intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head, a faint smile tugging at his lips. &#34;I&#39;ve already told you everything I know. It&#39;s not my fault if you&#39;re too blind to see what&#39;s right in front of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the air, heavy with implication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that mean?&#34; Enzo demanded, stepping toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carlo shrugged, the picture of nonchalance. &#34;It means you should stop looking so far away for your mole. Sometimes the danger is closer than you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could respond, a loud crash echoed from the back of the house. My heart leapt into my throat as everyone scrambled to their feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that?&#34; I whispered, my pulse pounding in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo was already moving, his gun drawn as he motioned for us to stay back. &#34;Stay here,&#34; he ordered, his voice low but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like hell I will,&#34; Vince said, pulling his own weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Both of you, stop,&#34; I hissed, my nerves fraying. &#34;We don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was too late. Enzo and Vince had already moved toward the source of the noise, leaving me and Carlo behind with Tony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Carlo, unease twisting in my gut. He was too calm, too composed, as if he already knew what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you hear that?&#34; he asked, his voice almost conversational.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hear what?&#34; I replied, my heart racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The sound of betrayal,&#34; he said, his smile widening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(POV: Enzo)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hallway was dark, every creak of the floorboards setting my nerves on edge. Vince was close behind me, his footsteps quiet but deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your play here?&#34; I whispered, my grip tightening on my gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My play?&#34; he repeated, his voice dripping with sarcasm. &#34;You think I planned this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;re hiding something,&#34; I said bluntly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could respond, a shadow moved at the end of the hall. My finger tightened on the trigger, but before I could react, the figure stepped into the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was one of the Moretti soldiers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit me like a punch to the gut, but what happened next stole the breath from my lungs. Vince didn&#39;t hesitate-he raised his gun and fired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soldier dropped, but the sound of the gunshot echoed through the house, a beacon for anyone nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you insane?&#34; I hissed, grabbing Vince by the arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was going to kill us,&#34; he shot back, shaking me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The argument was cut short by the sound of footsteps-several of them-approaching fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to move,&#34; Vince said, his voice tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before we could, another figure appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, it was Carlo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really shouldn&#39;t have done that,&#34; he said, his tone casual but laced with menace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; I demanded, my gun still raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carlo stepped closer, his expression darkening. &#34;I told you the danger was closer than you thought. You just didn&#39;t want to believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then he turned the gun on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>\---</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(POV: Isabella)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of a gunshot jolted me to my feet. My heart raced as I turned to Tony, who was struggling to sit up despite his injuries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay here,&#34; I said, grabbing the nearest weapon and running toward the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hallway was chaos. Vince was on the floor, blood pooling beneath him, and Enzo was standing over him, his face a mask of rage and betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; I demanded, my voice shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carlo,&#34; Enzo said through gritted teeth. &#34;He was the mole.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of his words hit me like a freight train. But before I could process it, the sound of more footsteps echoed through the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We weren&#39;t alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isabella, get back!&#34; Enzo shouted, raising his gun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wasn&#39;t fast enough. A shadow moved behind me, and cold steel pressed against my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drop it,&#34; a voice growled in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo froze, his eyes locking with mine. I saw the anguish there, the split-second decision he had to make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then everything went black.</p>
