                <p>(Tony&#39;s POV)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vinah&#39;s words hit me like a gut punch. And not the kind you shake off after a few seconds-the kind that leaves you doubled over, gasping for air, questioning all your life choices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Syndicate wasn&#39;t just some underground criminal network-it was worse than I ever imagined. They hadn&#39;t just infiltrated us; they&#39;d been controlling us from the inside. And Julian was dead because of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my fists, trying to steady my breathing. My mind raced. This wasn&#39;t some small-time gang war or a territorial dispute. This was big. Bigger than anything I had ever been prepared for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was I supposed to do now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tony, there&#39;s more,&#34; Robison&#39;s voice broke through my thoughts, bringing me back to the nightmare of reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to him, already bracing for whatever terrible news was about to slap me in the face. &#34;What kind of &#39;more&#39; are we talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robison hesitated. And let me tell you, Robison never hesitates. The guy is a walking, talking efficiency machine, so the fact that he was struggling to get the words out? Yeah, that didn&#39;t exactly make me feel better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt like an eternity, he exhaled sharply and finally said it. &#34;The Syndicate wants the intel we&#39;ve gathered over the years. They want you to deliver it personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sick feeling churned in my gut. My stomach twisted like I had just eaten a week-old burrito. &#34;And if I don&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Robison&#39;s expression turned to stone. &#34;Then they kill everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just me. Not just the team. But everyone connected to us. The Syndicate didn&#39;t bluff. I&#39;d seen firsthand what they were capable of. If they said they&#39;d wipe us out, they would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step back, running a hand through my hair, my mind racing a million miles per second. My options?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Give the Syndicate what they wanted and betray everything I stood for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or refuse and watch them murder the only family I had left?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, those choices sucked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The abandoned warehouse was dead silent except for the sound of my boots scraping against the concrete as I paced. Back and forth. Back and forth. Like a madman trying to find an escape route from a burning building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every possible move ran through my mind like a bad dream I couldn&#39;t wake up from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had to be another way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t just roll over and give the Syndicate what they wanted. That wasn&#39;t me. But I also couldn&#39;t let them go on a murder spree. That wasn&#39;t an option either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you hesitating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vinah&#39;s voice cut through the silence like a knife. I turned to find her standing in the doorway, arms crossed, looking at me like I was an idiot. Which, to be fair, I kind of felt like one right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what needs to be done, Tony,&#34; she said. &#34;Don&#39;t let them destroy us all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;I can&#39;t just hand over what they want. But I can&#39;t let them slaughter everyone either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curled into something that wasn&#39;t quite a smile. It was more predatory. &#34;Then we take matters into our own hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrowed my eyes. &#34;And what exactly are you suggesting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We strike first,&#34; she said. &#34;Find the mole. Eliminate them. Then we take down the Syndicate from the inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh. Just a simple assassination and an all-out war with the most dangerous criminal organization in existence. No big deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reckless determination in her voice sent a chill through me. It was a solid plan-except for one problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure I could trust her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure I could trust anyone at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could even respond, the air in the room shifted. You know that eerie feeling when someone enters a room, and the temperature drops like ten degrees? Yeah, that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow stretched across the floor. Slow, deliberate footsteps echoed in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t need to turn around. I knew exactly who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bastard himself. The Syndicate&#39;s local leader. The man responsible for all of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re still alive, I see,&#34; Marco said. His voice was smooth like he already knew exactly how this was going to end. And he was enjoying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my expression neutral. My muscles tensed, but I refused to let it show. If there was one thing Marco thrived on, it was fear. He liked to sniff it out like a bloodhound and use it as a weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t about to give him that satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, Marco?&#34; My voice was steady. Flat. Uninterested. Like he was a bad salesman trying to pitch me a terrible deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped further into the room, all casual-like. Like we were old friends just catching up. &#34;Only what&#39;s mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clenched my jaw. &#34;I don&#39;t belong to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marco chuckled, shaking his head like I was some naive kid who didn&#39;t understand how the world worked. &#34;Don&#39;t you?&#34; His gaze flickered briefly to Vinah before locking onto me again. &#34;Loyalty is a funny thing, Tony. And yours? It&#39;s not as valuable as you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blood boiled, but I forced myself to stay calm. He wanted me to react-to show weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t give him the satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not afraid of you,&#34; I said, keeping my voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marco&#39;s smirk widened into something dark. Something cold. Something dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that? That was the moment I knew-this was just the beginning of a long, bloody game. And I was smack in the middle of it.</p>
