                <p>****Isabella&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning after the explosion was cold and gray, as if even nature recognized the malevolent forces at work within the De Luca family. I hadn&#39;t set foot inside Marco&#39;s building in months-not since I&#39;d left the family business. Now, standing on the curb in front of the familiar structure, the weight of my brother&#39;s death and the danger surrounding us pressed heavily on my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo stood beside me, solid as ever. He had been silent the entire way, his eyes flicking from street to street, always vigilant for any sign of danger. Despite everything, I felt a strange sense of relief having him here, though I would never admit it aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just be careful,&#34; Enzo murmured as we approached the door. &#34;This guy might have bugged his apartment. You never know who else is watching us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, swallowing the anxiety that lodged in my throat. &#34;I just want to know what he was hiding,&#34; I whispered. &#34;I need to know why he got mixed up in all this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may not like what you find, *Bella,*&#34; Enzo warned, his voice low and grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down my spine, but I steeled myself. &#34;I have to know, Enzo. Whatever it is, I have to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We entered the building and took the elevator up to Marco&#39;s floor. The familiar hum of the elevator heightened the tension between us, the unspoken fears and worries hanging thick in the air. Outside his door, I hesitated, my hand hovering over the handle as I tried to steady my racing heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have the key?&#34; Enzo asked, his gaze steady on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, pulling a silver key from my pocket. My heart pounded as I unlocked the door and pushed it open. The apartment was exactly as Marco had left it: tidy, ordered, and depressingly quiet. The faint scent of his cologne lingered in the air, a haunting reminder of his presence that tugged painfully at my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was always so meticulous,&#34; I murmured, my eyes scanning the living room. &#34;Everything in its place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s start looking,&#34; Enzo said, moving to the corner of the room. &#34;If he was hiding something, it would be somewhere no one would think to look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and began searching alongside him, our movements growing frantic as we rummaged through Marco&#39;s belongings-opening drawers, sliding aside closet doors, running our hands along shelves, pulling open cabinets. My pulse quickened when Enzo stopped at the bottom drawer of Marco&#39;s desk and pulled out something curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here,&#34; Enzo said in a low voice, holding up a folder he had retrieved from a false bottom in the drawer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands trembled as I took the folder from him. Opening it, my eyes widened in shock at the documents inside: bank statements, contracts, and correspondence. But what really caught my attention was a letter in Marco&#39;s own handwriting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was addressed to our father, Giovanni, and as I read it, chills ran down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Papa, I know I&#39;ve been walking a fine line, and I don&#39;t think I can do it much longer. They&#39;re starting to get suspicious. The Romano family is watching me closely, but for now, I&#39;ve managed to keep them off our backs. But there&#39;s something bigger at play, something I can&#39;t quite figure out. If anything happens to me, it&#39;s not business-it&#39;s personal. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t protect the family like I promised. I&#39;m sorry for everything.*</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe. The implications of the letter were staggering. Marco had been playing a dangerous game, working with the Romanos to protect us, but it had gotten him killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enzo,&#34; I whispered, my voice trembling. &#34;He knew. He knew he was in danger and couldn&#39;t get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo&#39;s expression darkened as he read the letter. &#34;Mamma Mia. Questo cambia tutto,&#34; he muttered. &#34;Your father&#39;s in the crossfire now. If the Romanos find out about this, they&#39;ll come after him next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged through me like a tidal wave. &#34;We have to warn him. We have to do something before it&#39;s too late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo nodded, his eyes already distant as he planned our next move. &#34;We need more information. We need to find out who Marco was dealing with and what they wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do we start?&#34; My voice shook with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nico&#39;s bar,&#34; he replied without hesitation. &#34;If anyone knows something, it&#39;s Nico. He and Marco were like brothers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of involving Nico, Marco&#39;s childhood best friend, twisted my stomach into knots. Could I trust him? Did I really know him? But I had no choice. We needed answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We left Marco&#39;s apartment with heavy hearts and heavier revelations. The ride to Nico&#39;s bar was tense, the silence between us thick with unspoken fears. My mind raced, trying to piece together the puzzle of my brother&#39;s life. Enzo remained focused, his face impassive as he navigated the city streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time we arrived at the bar, evening had set in. The place was quiet, dimly lit, with only a few patrons scattered about. Nico was behind the counter, arranging glasses. When he saw me, his face lit up with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bella,&#34; he greeted, stepping out from behind the bar to embrace me. &#34;It&#39;s been too long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Nico,&#34; I said, returning his hug, though it felt stiff, forced. &#34;Can I talk to you about something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34; His smile flickered as he led us to a quieter booth at the back of the bar. &#34;What&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. &#34;Nico, I need to ask you about Marco.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nico&#39;s expression darkened instantly. &#34;I still can&#39;t believe he&#39;s really gone,&#34; he murmured. &#34;I keep trying to make sense of it, but nothing adds up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s why we&#39;re here,&#34; I said gently. &#34;We found some things in Marco&#39;s apartment-things that suggest he was involved in something dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nico stiffened, his eyes narrowing. &#34;What kind of things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Enzo, who gave me a subtle nod. &#34;Documents, letters It seems Marco was working with the Romano family, but he was also trying to protect us. He was caught in the middle, and I think it got him killed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nico&#39;s face grew somber as he crossed his arms, leaning back in his chair. &#34;That doesn&#39;t sound like Marco. He was always loyal to the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I said softly. &#34;But he was trying to protect us all, Nico. He was in over his head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nico looked down at the table, clearly troubled. &#34;I wish I could have done something,&#34; he mumbled. &#34;I wish I had known.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached across the table and took his hand. &#34;We need your help, Nico. We need to find out who Marco was dealing with and why they wanted him dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confliction played in his eyes as he met my gaze. &#34;Bella, you know I&#39;d do anything for you,&#34; he said seriously. &#34;But this is dangerous. Digging into this will make a lot of enemies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care,&#34; I replied firmly. &#34;I have to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nico hesitated, his eyes flicking to Enzo, who returned the look with a hard stare. &#34;And him?&#34; Nico asked, nodding toward Enzo. &#34;Can we trust him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Enzo could respond, I answered. &#34;Enzo&#39;s been with me through all of this. I trust him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nico still seemed unsure but eventually nodded. &#34;Okay. I&#39;ll help you. But be careful, Bella. This could get messy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Nico,&#34; I said, squeezing his hand gratefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo stood, his voice cold and measured as he thanked Nico. &#34;We appreciate your help. I&#39;d hate to think there&#39;s something you&#39;re not telling us, something that might help us understand why Marco died.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nico squared his shoulders, meeting Enzo&#39;s gaze head-on. &#34;I&#39;m as much in the dark as you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo nodded, but the tension between them was palpable. I felt uneasy, my instincts telling me something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we left the bar and walked to the car, I gripped Enzo&#39;s arm, anxiety gnawing at me. &#34;Do you think we can trust him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo&#39;s expression was grim as he unlocked the car. &#34;I don&#39;t know. Something about him made me uncomfortable. But right now, we don&#39;t have many options.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if he&#39;s involved? What if he knows more than he&#39;s letting on?&#34; I asked, my voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enzo glanced at me as we got into the car. &#34;That&#39;s exactly what we need to find out.&#34;</p>
