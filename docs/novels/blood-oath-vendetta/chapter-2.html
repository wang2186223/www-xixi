                <p>**Enzo&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the funeral, I could still feel the weight of the De Luca estate&#39;s oppressive silence as I made my way to the study. The mourners had left, but I remained-along with a few others who understood what was at stake. Giovanni De Luca was facing the window when I arrived, his back straight and tense. It was clear he didn&#39;t want to be disturbed, but I had no choice. Business, after all, couldn&#39;t wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused outside the door, listening. I could hear Isabella&#39;s voice, steady but filled with the kind of resolve that I knew all too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Papa*,&#34; she said, her tone firm, masking whatever turmoil churned inside her. &#34;You don&#39;t have a choice. Marco&#39;s dead, and I need to know why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giovanni&#39;s response was muffled, but I could sense the weariness in his voice. &#34;This is not your fight, Bella. I don&#39;t want you involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crossed the room quickly, her footsteps soft but determined. &#34;I deserve to know what happened. You owe me that much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew this wouldn&#39;t end well. Giovanni was trying to protect her, but he didn&#39;t understand the depth of her determination-or the danger that lurked just beyond their gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time to step in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked once before pushing open the door, catching their attention. Both of them turned to look at me, Giovanni&#39;s expression tight with barely concealed anger, and Isabella&#39;s eyes flickering with something between surprise and curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. De Luca,&#34; I nodded toward Giovanni, though my gaze never left Isabella. I needed her to understand the gravity of the situation, to see that this wasn&#39;t just about revenge-it was about survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giovanni&#39;s jaw tightened further. &#34;Business before family this time, Romano.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is business to discuss,&#34; I agreed, stepping further into the room. &#34;But it appears that I&#39;ve interrupted a family matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever business you have can wait,&#34; Giovanni snapped, his tone sharp and uncharacteristically defensive. &#34;This is a private conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Isabella, reading the turmoil in her eyes. She deserved to know the truth, even if it hurt. &#34;On the contrary, Mr. De Luca,&#34; I said, still holding Isabella&#39;s gaze. &#34;I think this concerns her just as much as it does you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella&#39;s heart skipped a beat-I could see it in her eyes. She knew I wasn&#39;t here for pleasantries. I was here because Marco&#39;s death wasn&#39;t the end; it was only the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;*Papa*,&#34; she said softly, but there was steel in her voice. &#34;Let him speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giovanni&#39;s silence was his only response. He turned away from us, his back once again facing the window as if that could shield him from the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped closer to Isabella, lowering my voice. &#34;Marco was involved in something dangerous, *Bella.* Something that put not just him, but your whole family in jeopardy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened slightly, a mix of fear and determination crossing her face. &#34;What do you mean? What was Marco involved in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, glancing at Giovanni before answering. &#34;Your brother was dealing with some very powerful people. People who don&#39;t take kindly to betrayal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Betrayal?&#34; Isabella repeated, her voice trembling slightly. &#34;You mean Marco betrayed someone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded slowly, choosing my words carefully. &#34;It appears he was playing both sides-working for your family&#39;s interests while making deals with others. Something went wrong, and now those people are seeking revenge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giovanni stiffened but remained silent, the weight of the situation pressing down on him like a physical force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella, on the other hand, was relentless. &#34;Who are these people?&#34; she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re not the kind you can reason with,&#34; I warned, my voice grave. &#34;They&#39;re the kind who send a message with blood. Marco tried to outmaneuver them, but he failed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath hitched, and I could see the realization sinking in. &#34;And now they&#39;re coming for us,&#34; she whispered, her voice barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;Marco&#39;s death was just the beginning. If we don&#39;t find a way to stop this, your entire family could be in danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giovanni finally turned, his expression thunderous. &#34;And you think you can protect us, Romano?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met his gaze evenly. &#34;I failed Marco, yes, but I won&#39;t fail you. There&#39;s still a chance we can stop this from getting worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella&#39;s voice broke through the tension, quivering but resolute. &#34;What do we need to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to know exactly what Marco was involved in and who he crossed,&#34; I said, urgency lacing my words. &#34;That&#39;s the only way we&#39;ll be able to protect your family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded slowly, the reality of the situation finally hitting her. &#34;Then I&#39;m in. I&#39;ll help you find out what Marco was doing, and we&#39;ll stop these people before they hurt anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bella, no,&#34; Giovanni interjected sharply. &#34;This isn&#39;t your fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it is,&#34; Isabella fired back, her voice strong. &#34;Marco was my brother. I need to know what happened, and if that means getting involved in this mess, then so be it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giovanni&#39;s face was a storm of emotions-pride, fear, anger-all battling for dominance. He knew, just as I did, that she wasn&#39;t a little girl anymore. She was a De Luca, and that meant something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we&#39;re doing this,&#34; I said, breaking the silence, &#34;we need to start now. Whoever took Marco down isn&#39;t going to wait much longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determination flashed in Isabella&#39;s eyes. &#34;What&#39;s our first step?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marco&#39;s belongings-his phone, his laptop-anything that might give us a clue about who he was dealing with,&#34; I replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giovanni&#39;s expression darkened further. &#34;You want us to sift through the remnants of my son&#39;s life, hoping to find something that could ruin us all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we don&#39;t,&#34; I murmured, &#34;someone else will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of my words hung in the air, and I could see the burden settling on Isabella&#39;s shoulders. There was no turning back now, not for any of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So be it,&#34; Isabella finally said, her voice firm. &#34;I&#39;ll go through Marco&#39;s things. If there&#39;s something in there, I&#39;ll find it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll help you,&#34; I added, my gaze locking onto hers. &#34;We&#39;ll do this together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could say more, a sudden explosion shook the entire estate. The ground beneath us trembled, and the windows rattled with the force. The sound of shattering glass and the roar of flames filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get low!&#34; I shouted, instinct taking over as I grabbed Isabella&#39;s arm, pulling her toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We burst into the hallway, and the scene outside was one of utter chaos. A car near the entrance was a twisted, flaming wreck, the heat from the fire searing the air. Estate security was scrambling, trying to contain the blaze and shouting orders into their radios.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella&#39;s eyes were wide with shock, her mind struggling to process what had just happened. But I knew. This was no accident. This was a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re letting us know they&#39;re here,&#34; I said grimly, my grip on her arm tightening. &#34;And they won&#39;t stop until they get what they want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We hurried back inside, the heavy doors slamming shut behind us. There was no going back now. The alliance we had just forged was our only hope, but it was a fragile one, and the stakes had never been higher.</p>
