                <p>Ariella stood before the small, tarnished mirror hanging on the cabin wall. Dawn&#39;s first light seeped through the shutters, casting a soft glow over her reflection. She hardly recognized the face staring back at her. Strands of her dark hair fell loosely around her shoulders, tangled and unkempt from days without proper care. Her emerald eyes, once bright with curiosity, now held shadows of exhaustion and uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She traced a finger over a smudge of dirt on her cheek, a remnant of the forest&#39;s embrace. Bruises and scrapes marked her fair skin-a silent testament to the trials she&#39;d faced recently. The simple tunic and trousers she wore were a size too large, borrowed from the cabin&#39;s scant supplies, and hung loosely on her slender frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella sighed softly. The girl in the mirror looked like a stranger-a far cry from the disciplined student at the academy. Yet, amidst the weariness, there was a flicker of resilience in her eyes. She straightened her posture, noticing how the morning light highlighted the faint freckles across her nose, a feature she&#39;d often overlooked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft rustling outside pulled her from her thoughts. She turned away from the mirror and stepped toward the cabin door, opening it to the crisp morning air. The scent of pine and damp earth greeted her, refreshing and grounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian approached from the treeline, his silhouette framed by the golden hues of sunrise. His expression was unreadable, but his eyes held a hint of urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ready?&#34; he asked, his voice low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella nodded, though the weight of everything pressed down on her. &#34;Where exactly are we going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a town not too far from here. We can get supplies, keep a low profile for a bit,&#34; he said, tightening the straps of his pack. &#34;And then we meet my contact.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had more questions, but she held them back for now. The less she asked, the faster they could move. Together, they set off into the woods, the path narrow and overgrown with roots and thick brush. The sun was rising slowly, but the shadows of the forest remained long, casting eerie shapes along the trail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence between them was thick, broken only by the occasional snap of a branch underfoot. Ariella&#39;s thoughts wandered, as they always did when they walked in silence. She wondered about this contact he spoke of, about what he knew of the Veil. Could they really help? And why did Dorian seem so sure?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, they reached the edge of the forest. Beyond the trees, a small town came into view. It wasn&#39;t much-just a few houses scattered along a dusty road, a market square in the distance-but it was bustling with morning activity. Farmers carried crates of produce, merchants set up stalls, and a group of children chased each other near the well in the center of town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella paused just before they reached the edge of the town, her eyes scanning the people moving about. &#34;What if someone recognizes me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t stop walking but threw a quick look over his shoulder. &#34;Keep your head down. Don&#39;t talk to anyone unless you have to. We&#39;ll be in and out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, tugging her hood lower, letting the fabric shield her face from prying eyes. Together, they entered the town, slipping into the morning bustle. The sounds of the market hit her first-voices haggling over prices, the clatter of carts rolling by, and the smell of fresh bread mixing with the sharp scent of livestock. For a moment, it almost felt normal, like she wasn&#39;t running for her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved swiftly through the crowd, keeping to the side streets and shadows. Dorian led them to a small, weathered tavern near the edge of the square, away from the main market. He pushed the door open, and a wave of warmth from the fire inside washed over them as they stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was dimly lit, with rough wooden tables scattered across the floor and a stone hearth crackling in the corner. A few locals sat around, either chatting quietly or lost in their own thoughts. He gestured for her to follow him toward a table near the back, and she quickly slid into one of the chairs, keeping her head down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling in across from her, his eyes briefly scanning the room before he leaned back, as if waiting for something. Ariella&#39;s nerves were still on edge. She kept her hood up, her gaze flicking between the patrons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long are we supposed to wait?&#34; she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;ll come,&#34; he said calmly, his eyes fixed on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to drag. The longer they sat, the heavier the silence between them grew. Ariella fiddled with the edge of her cloak, her mind racing. What if this contact didn&#39;t show? What if Dorian had made a mistake? The tension in her gut coiled tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the worry threatened to take over, the tavern door creaked open. A man stepped inside, his figure tall and cloaked. He scanned the room quickly before his eyes landed on Dorian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian stood up as the man approached, offering a small nod of acknowledgment. &#34;It&#39;s been a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stranger lowered his hood, revealing a face lined with age but sharp with awareness. His eyes moved to Ariella, studying her with a level of intensity that made her skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This the one you were talking about?&#34; he asked, his voice gravelly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian nodded. &#34;This is Ariella.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man took a moment, looking her over before speaking again. &#34;We can&#39;t talk here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he motioned for them to follow. Ariella glanced at Dorian, but he was already moving, so she quickly rose and followed them out of the tavern, weaving through the narrow streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached a small alleyway and stopped in front of a nearly invisible door hidden in the shadows. The man pulled out a key and unlocked it, ushering them inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room they entered was cramped, with shelves crammed full of books and scrolls, leaving little space to move. Dust hung in the air, but the room felt safe, secluded from prying eyes. The man shut the door behind them, locking it tight before turning to face them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; he said, his voice serious. &#34;Let&#39;s talk.&#34;</p>
