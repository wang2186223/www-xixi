                <p>The ground shook beneath Ariella&#39;s feet as the narrow mountain pass crumbled around them. Dorian pulled her forward, his grip firm on her arm as they weaved through the falling rocks. The roar of the collapsing stone was deafening, and the freezing air bit at their faces as they ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to move faster!&#34; Dorian shouted, his voice barely cutting through the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella&#39;s legs screamed in protest, her body drained from the effort of unleashing her magic. Each step was a battle, her lungs burning from the cold air. She could feel the presence of the cloaked figures behind them, shadowy forms slipping through the falling debris, relentless in their pursuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are we going?&#34; she called out, struggling to keep up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a ridge ahead,&#34; Dorian replied, urgency tightening his tone. &#34;If we reach it, we might lose them among the cliffs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart pounded, fear surging through her veins. Before she could fully process his words, the ground beneath her shifted with a loud crack. Her foot slipped, and suddenly she was falling as the edge of the pass gave way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ariella!&#34; Dorian shouted, eyes wide with alarm. His hand shot out, seizing her wrist just in time. Muscles straining, he struggled to pull her back from the brink, his face etched with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at me, Ariella!&#34; he commanded, his voice trembling. &#34;Don&#39;t look down. I&#39;ve got you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze met his, panic mirrored in his eyes. Her legs dangled over the abyss, the jagged ravine below threatening to swallow her whole. The world seemed to blur-the roar of the wind and her own racing heartbeat filling her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on,&#34; he urged desperately, his grip tightening. &#34;I won&#39;t let you fall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Summoning her strength, she clung to his arm with both hands, feeling the solid warmth of his grasp anchoring her to the world. With a determined grunt, Dorian pulled her upward, inch by inch, until she was safely back on solid ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, they stood close, breaths mingling in the cold air. His arms remained around her, and she could feel the rapid thud of his heartbeat matching her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; he asked softly, concern flooding his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded shakily, her voice barely above a whisper. &#34;Thanks to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flashed across his face, but the urgency quickly returned. The faint sound of footsteps echoed from behind-their pursuers were still on their trail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to keep moving,&#34; he said firmly, helping her steady herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella took a deep breath, willing her legs to cooperate. &#34;Right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They pressed on, her steps unsteady but fueled by adrenaline. The path ahead was narrow, barely wide enough for them to navigate side by side. The wind whipped through the pass, carrying the ominous whispers of the cloaked figures drawing nearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re almost there,&#34; Dorian urged as they reached the ridge. &#34;Just a little further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella&#39;s muscles burned with exhaustion, but she pushed herself onward, her breath coming in sharp, ragged bursts. The open sky finally appeared as they emerged from the pass, the towering walls giving way to a snow-covered expanse ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stumbled upon reaching the ridge, collapsing to her knees in the snow. Every part of her ached, her energy nearly spent. But there was no time to rest. The wind howled around them, and Dorian was already urging her forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to keep moving,&#34; he insisted, pulling her gently back to her feet. &#34;They&#39;re still behind us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella&#39;s head was spinning, the world around her a blur. She could barely think, barely breathe. The magic she had released was still coursing through her veins, wild and uncontrollable, and she was terrified of what would happen if she tried to use it again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where... where are we going?&#34; she gasped, her legs trembling beneath her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian&#39;s eyes scanned the horizon, his expression grim. &#34;There&#39;s an entrance to the library at the base of the next peak,&#34; he said, pointing ahead. &#34;We&#39;re close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella&#39;s heart skipped a beat. The library. The place they had been searching for, the one that held the answers to her past. She wanted to feel relief, but all she felt was fear. Fear that the cloaked figures would catch them before they could reach it. Fear of what the truth might reveal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The snow crunched beneath their boots as they pressed on, the icy wind biting at their faces. The mountain loomed ahead, its jagged peaks casting long shadows across the frozen landscape. Ariella&#39;s breath came in shallow gasps, her body struggling to keep up with Dorian&#39;s determined pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they neared the base of the peak, Dorian stopped, his hand flying to the hilt of his dagger. &#34;Wait,&#34; he whispered, his eyes narrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella froze, her heart pounding in her chest. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re here,&#34; Dorian said quietly, his voice tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella&#39;s stomach turned as she felt it too-a dark, oppressive presence that seemed to suffocate the air around them. The cloaked figures had found them again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian stepped in front of her, his dagger drawn. &#34;We can&#39;t fight them here,&#34; he muttered, his eyes scanning the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Ariella could respond, the first figure appeared out of the swirling snow, its dark cloak blending with the storm. Then another. And another. They moved silently, their faces hidden beneath their hoods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella&#39;s hands trembled as her magic surged within her, but she was too exhausted to control it. She had barely been able to hold it back before, and now it threatened to consume her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You cannot run from us,&#34; the lead figure hissed, its voice like a whisper carried on the wind. &#34;You belong to the Veil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella&#39;s blood ran cold. The words hit her like a physical blow, the weight of the figure&#39;s presence pressing down on her. She couldn&#39;t move. She couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t belong to anyone,&#34; she whispered, her voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure raised its hand, dark energy swirling around it like a storm. Ariella&#39;s heart raced as she tried to summon her magic, but it wouldn&#39;t come. She was too weak, too drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian stepped forward, blocking the figure&#39;s attack with his dagger. The force of the impact sent him stumbling back, but he recovered quickly, his eyes blazing with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go!&#34; he shouted, his voice raw with urgency. &#34;Get to the library!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella&#39;s feet felt like they were stuck in place, but she forced herself to move. She turned and bolted, her legs barely able to carry her down the slope. The snow was thick and uneven beneath her feet, but she pushed through, the adrenaline surging through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entrance to the library was just ahead, a faint glow barely visible through the storm. Ariella&#39;s heart pounded as she stumbled toward it, her hands shaking as she reached for the stone door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled it open, the warmth inside hitting her like a wave as she collapsed against the wall. She had made it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Dorian was still out there.</p>
