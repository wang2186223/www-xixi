                <p>The streets of the city were deserted, the only sound Ariella could hear was the distant ringing of the academy&#39;s alarms echoing through the night. She moved quickly, darting through narrow streets and slipping into shadows, her heart pounding in her chest. She had no idea where she was going. All she knew was that she needed to put as much distance between herself and the academy as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The city felt strange at night-darker, more threatening. It was a far cry from the busy, bustling streets she had known during the day. Without the usual noise and crowds, every corner, every alley felt dangerous. But she had no choice. She was a fugitive now, and if the guards found her, there was no telling what they&#39;d do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rounded a corner and skidded to a stop, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The narrow street ahead was blocked by a group of figures. For a moment, her heart leapt into her throat, thinking they were the guards. But as her eyes adjusted to the dim light, she realized these people weren&#39;t wearing the academy&#39;s colors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were cloaked in shadow, their faces obscured by hoods. She couldn&#39;t make out their expressions, but the way they stood, rigid and watchful, sent a chill down her spine. Whoever they were, they weren&#39;t here by accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella slowly backed away, trying not to draw attention to herself, but it was too late. One of the figures stepped forward, his voice low and smooth. &#34;What&#39;s a little apprentice like you doing out so late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach twisted. She had to run. Before she could turn, the figure raised his hand, and a flash of magic shot toward her. She barely had time to react, her own magic surging in response. A barrier of shimmering light sprang up in front of her, deflecting the blast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure cocked his head slightly, a hint of amusement in his voice. &#34;Impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella didn&#39;t wait to see what came next. Her instincts took over, and she spun on her heel, bolting down the narrow street. Her breath was ragged in her throat, her pulse pounding in her ears. Her legs burned as she pushed herself harder, but she couldn&#39;t stop. She didn&#39;t dare look back. Whoever those people were, they were after her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She darted through the maze of streets, the shadows stretching out like traps at every turn. Her heart raced as she zigzagged through the city, each corner blurring into the next. The streets felt like a labyrinth, twisting and endless, with no clear way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up ahead, a set of stairs caught her eye. Without thinking, she lunged for them, her legs trembling as she climbed. Each step felt heavier than the last, but she pushed on until she reached the rooftop. She crouched low, catching her breath as she glanced out over the city. The rooftops stretched into the distance, bathed in soft, silver moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in what felt like hours, she allowed herself to pause. She scanned the streets below-empty. The cloaked figures had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing a hand to her chest, Ariella forced herself to breathe. What just happened? First the academy... now this? Her mind raced, trying to piece together the fragments of what she&#39;d seen. The Veil, the figure who had called her the heir. What did it all mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know, not yet. But her life had shifted in an instant, and there was no turning back. The magic she&#39;d struggled with for so long was now her only defense, but she barely knew how to use it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to keep moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no time to waste, she climbed down the other side of the building, slipping quietly into the shadows of the city. The sound of alarms had faded into the distance, leaving the streets eerily quiet once more. She had managed to escape... for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glow of the city&#39;s main streets had faded behind her, replaced by narrower, darker alleys that seemed to close in the deeper she went. Her legs ached, exhaustion weighing on her as she pushed forward. She needed to find safety, but where? She didn&#39;t know anyone outside the academy, didn&#39;t have anywhere to hide. Every corner felt like a trap waiting to spring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The further she went, the quieter the city became. The streets here were unfamiliar, the buildings taller, their windows dark. She glanced back once more, half-expecting to see the cloaked figures following her, but the streets remained empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t stop. She had to keep moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just ahead, the streets narrowed even further, leading her into an unfamiliar part of the city. She hesitated, her chest tightening with uncertainty. But going back wasn&#39;t an option. With one last glance behind her, Ariella pressed on, her body tense as she moved through the darkness, hoping the shadows would keep her safe.</p>
