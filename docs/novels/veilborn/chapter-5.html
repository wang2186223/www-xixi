                <p>Morning light filtered through the cracks in the cabin&#39;s shutters, casting slender beams across the wooden floor. Ariella blinked awake, the remnants of restless dreams clinging to the edges of her mind. The events of the previous night rushed back-the escape from Ardania, the forest trek, and the safehouse where she now found herself alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat up slowly, her muscles stiff from exhaustion and the unfamiliar bed. The scent of pine and damp earth filled the room, a stark contrast to the sterile halls of the academy. As she rubbed the sleep from her eyes, reality settled in: she was on the run, and everything she once knew had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising to her feet, Ariella moved to the small window and pushed it open. Crisp morning air greeted her, carrying the soft melodies of birds hidden among the leaves. The forest stretched out before her, both inviting and isolating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts drifted to Dorian. His sudden appearance and equally abrupt departure left her with more questions than answers. Who was he really? How much did he really know? And why did he choose to help her? Despite her initial mistrust, she couldn&#39;t deny the lingering curiosity-and a faint hope that their paths might cross again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft knock at the door snapped her out of her thoughts. Her body tensed immediately. She wasn&#39;t expecting anyone. Slowly, she reached for the dagger she kept strapped to her side, her heart pounding in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knock came again, louder this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy,&#34; came a familiar voice from the other side. &#34;It&#39;s just me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella let out a breath she didn&#39;t know she was holding. Dorian. She slid the dagger back into its sheath, her body still on edge as she opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian stood in the doorway, leaning casually against the frame, his usual smirk plastered across his face. &#34;You didn&#39;t think I was just going to leave you out here, did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella frowned. &#34;Why are you back? You said you had your own problems to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation. &#34;I figured you could use a little more information before you decide to trust me or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Information?&#34; Ariella crossed her arms, watching him closely. &#34;You know something I don&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian gave her a long look, his smirk fading. &#34;Let&#39;s just say there are more people interested in you than you think. And they&#39;re not just after your magic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach twisted. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over to the window, glancing out into the dark woods before turning back to her. &#34;The Veil. It&#39;s not just some ancient myth. It&#39;s real. And it&#39;s weakening. The people hunting you? They think you&#39;re the key to controlling it. They think you can do something no one else can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella stared at him, her mind racing. The Veil. The figure in her vision had said something about it, but she hadn&#39;t understood. Now, hearing it again, the pieces started to come together-though it still didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t even know how to control my magic,&#34; she said quietly, more to herself than to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian shifted, leaning back against the wall with his arms folded across his chest. &#34;It doesn&#39;t really matter if you know how to control it or not. What matters is they think you can. And that&#39;s enough to make you their target.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella&#39;s pulse quickened. &#34;Who are these people? What do they want with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated for a second, his gaze darkening. &#34;They&#39;re the kind of people you don&#39;t want to mess with,&#34; he said quietly. &#34;Let&#39;s just say they&#39;ve had their eye on you for a long time-longer than you probably realize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella felt a shiver run down her spine. She had always known her magic was different, difficult to control, but this was beyond anything she had imagined. Now it felt like there was so much more at stake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eyed him suspiciously, her voice lowering. &#34;And what about you? Why are you even helping me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, Dorian&#39;s eyes locked with hers before he looked away, his expression unreadable. &#34;I&#39;ve got my reasons,&#34; he muttered, his voice losing its usual lightness. &#34;Let&#39;s leave it at that for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to push him further, but something in his tone told her she wouldn&#39;t get much more out of him. Even though her unease deepened, she couldn&#39;t afford to alienate the one person who had helped her so far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what am I supposed to do?&#34; she asked, trying to keep her voice steady despite the dread building inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian turned to face her again, his expression hardening. &#34;You don&#39;t have a lot of time. This cabin might be safe for the moment, but that won&#39;t last. We&#39;ll need to get out of here before sunrise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella nodded, though every bone in her body ached with exhaustion. She had been running for what felt like days, and the thought of leaving again so soon made her stomach turn. But she knew he was right. They weren&#39;t out of danger yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s someone you need to meet,&#34; Dorian added after a pause, his tone softening slightly. &#34;He&#39;s the only one I know who might have the answers you&#39;re looking for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned. &#34;Who is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian&#39;s eyes drifted toward the window as if he was scanning the forest. &#34;An old contact of mine,&#34; he said, his voice distant. &#34;He knows more about the Veil than anyone. If anyone can help you figure out what&#39;s happening, it&#39;s him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella&#39;s body felt like it could collapse at any moment, her limbs heavy with exhaustion. She had been running for so long, and now Dorian was asking her to trust yet another stranger. The idea didn&#39;t sit well with her, but what choice did she have? She was out of options and knew she couldn&#39;t figure this out alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath. &#34;Where are we going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian&#39;s expression softened slightly. &#34;We&#39;ll head out as soon as the sun comes up,&#34; he said, his tone more serious now. &#34;Get whatever rest you can. You&#39;ll need it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ariella stood there, not moving, still trying to decide how much she trusted him. She didn&#39;t feel like she had much of a choice anymore. Reluctantly, she crossed the small room and sat down on the edge of the cot. The old mattress groaned under her weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorian gave her a quick nod before stepping toward the door. He hesitated for a second, as if considering whether to say something more, but instead, he opened the door and disappeared into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in the quiet cabin, Ariella stared at the spot where he&#39;d been. The unease gnawing at her didn&#39;t go away. She knew, deep down, that this was just the beginning.</p>
