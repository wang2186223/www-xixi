                <p>Amanda&#39;s POV</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pinned up the tiny strands of my hair which settled comfortably on my forehead. I straightened my shirt which was carefully tucked in my black palazzo pants. I was looking over my watch, again and again, considering the fact that I was running short of time. The receptionist then announced my name. I quickly stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh Yes! I did not go to college that day. I had to sort out a big amount of mess first. I kept canceling the continuous innumerable calls of Gina and Francis. I avoided keeping my phone on silent because Mr. Reynolds could call me any moment and I didn&#39;t want it to be another reason, to sum up on his scolding towards me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh now, you may think that if I was not in Mr. Reynolds&#39;s office then whose? I was somewhere I was supposed to be. I kept walking silently towards the cabin I was called in. I knocked on the door, not more than two times, and there was an immediate response of &#34;come in &#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went inside the cabin and initiated the conversation with a sweet smile paired with a good morning wish. Mr. Linley was one heck of a well mannered and kind-heartened person as he greeted me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I assume you&#39;re here for one sort of fake drama. If that&#39;s the case then I&#39;m certainly not interested to listen to your irrelevant drama all over again&#34;, he turned away and continued doing the paperwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sorry, I really am&#34;, I tried indulging into eye contact with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else Miss Waters aka Mrs. Steve&#34;, he frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shattered from within, on realizing how much of a liar I was in the past. The person who wanted me to attend his party, who greeted me warmly, now couldn&#39;t even resist my presence in his cabin &#34;I couldn&#39;t sleep last night. I&#39;m truly sorry&#34;, I apologized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After completely listening to my sentence, he nodded but didn&#39;t utter a word. Not even a single one &#34;If only I could make up for the loss. I apologize on my behalf to Mrs. Linley. She&#39;s a sweetheart&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He played with his pen for a while and then replied &#34;If you are doing this for my signature over the contract papers then it&#39;s really not a good idea, and certainly a waste of your precious time, which you could probably invest in planning another fraudulent practice&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I removed the papers from my bag and handed over to him, &#34;This is a genuine apology, Sir. Keep those papers for assurance that I at least did not fake a &#39;sorry&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carefully lifted myself up from the seat and gathered all my guts and concluded my apologetic lines with one last sentence, &#34;Sir, I&#39;m not faking it. We were genuine enough to take a step back when realizing our mistake. We could easily fool you last night. We didn&#39;t do it, though&#34;, I took small steps towards the exit, and yes I used the term &#39;we&#39; when Mr. Reynolds was not even in guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give my regards to Mrs. Linley and heartily congratulations once again&#34;, I turned around before turning the doorknob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss. Waters&#34;, I heard my name being called from the back, my eyes collided with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You left these papers&#34;, he smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry sir &#34;, I added up to the innumerable apologies for the day and left his cabin. The papers were yet in my hand, I felt like throwing them in the dustbin but I could probably throw them in Mr. Richie Rich&#39;s dustbin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On starting to fold the papers, I carefully placed them in my bag. But then I saw an inked thing over it. I removed the papers again and after having a closer observation, I realized that they were signed already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so overjoyed that I directly ran towards Mr. Linley&#39;s cabin and entered without a knock and directly shook his hands. Ah yes, I was about to hug him but my nerves had great control over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you so much, sir. It means a lot to me, for us. A real lot &#34;, I grinned like a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love your honesty Amanda&#34;, Oh yeah, he called me Amanda. I almost forgot my name because of the professional circle. Who knew a little apology and a good cute smile could do wanders. I was overwhelmed by the fact that I at least didn&#39;t lie. I thought that Mr. Reynolds would appreciate me for once actually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waved him a final goodbye and left his cabin. I canceled all of Mr. Reynolds&#39;s calls because I wanted to tell him the good news all by myself. This was the first time I actually proved myself. I wanted to show him that in this world where everything is so plastic and materialistic, honesty and humanity still existed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a taxi as fast as I could and signaled the driver the address of my office. I reached in a few minutes and rushed towards the elevator. I encountered James aka the manager plus Mr. Reynolds&#39;s best friend standing there playing with his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi there&#34;, I waved. I was really in a good mood because I just couldn&#39;t control my happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Reynolds is very angry right now. I&#39;m really scared about the consequences. He has been inquiring about you since the morning&#34;, he checked his phone and then continued &#34;Here goes another call for you&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please just let it go, don&#39;t give an answer to this call. I&#39;m reaching his cabin right now&#34;, I insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay fine, rush baby girl &#34;, he pointed towards the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I disliked James too much. He always tried flirting with me. I was more into a gentleman kind of man. Whenever I looked in his eyes, I just didn&#39;t feel right. I felt like he was masked up and just pretended to be something like he impersonated some good image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I, at once rushed towards Mr. Reynolds&#39;s cabin. &#34;Can I come in sir?&#34; I questioned knocking at the doorstep of Mr. Reynolds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes madam, your presence is something which is highly relevant for this situation&#34;, I could sense the sarcasm behind his smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk&#34;, I went closer to him taking small steps. He looked really angry, I was scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, we sure need too&#34;, he came towards me, and finally we were just a hand distance away. Every moment about yesterday&#39;s night was playing repeatedly in my brain, in a black and white format. I couldn&#39;t just forget about it, everything about the night before was so different and unusual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy who didn&#39;t like standing next to me held my hand, The guy who was prone to an ugly restricted language said the sweetest words any guy had ever spoken to me except Francis. The guy who acted like a complete racist kissed me. I don&#39;t know if that was real or just an illusion but it definitely meant something to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what would you like to say on your behalf Miss Amanda Water&#34;, I knew his speech was going to be a dreadful one so I decided to tell him at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir&#34;, he kept his hand over my mouth and ceased me from talking any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shush &#34;, he glued his lips, held me closer through his hands, and tightly pushed my back against the wall and came closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let go of me, you&#39;re hurting me&#34;, I tried pushing myself forward but his muscles were so hard that the more I tried, the more it caused me pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You started the trouble, you always do. You&#39;re always in a mood for revenge, aren&#39;t you?&#34; he rhetorically questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-Uh&#34;, he stopped me from talking again and this time, he placed his hands over my lips tighter than before. My body was shivering out of fear. I had no power to free myself as he was stronger than me. I was devastated by the fact that his mind was yet rotating around the revenge cycle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me with wide eyes. His eyes were deep and scary. The sclera of his eyes was surrounded with a shade of red which obviously scared me more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you were in a mood to play the truth-truth game, why did you stretch the drama? Like, you could&#39;ve said that to Mr. Linley, the very moment. I knew that girls like you only want attention&#34;</p>
